{"rating": 0.0, "release_date": "1972-03-24", "num_reviews": 5315, "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "summary": "N/A", "The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!": "Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.", "An offer so good, I couldn't refuse": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.", "For Me, This Is The Definitive Film": "Nice. Its a. This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.", "One of the best of all time.": "A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.", "An Iconic Film": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.", "The greatest movie of all time!": "One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama. The action was simply amazing, what else could you say. Watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talla Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. Whit this movie Marlon Brand, his performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost has not already become a cliche. His performance though was subtle and breathtaking. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well.", "Another kind of \"family movie\"": "The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about gangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos\u00e9 of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.", "#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!": "Up until today, I haven't bothered to review \"The Godfather\". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather: Part II\", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.", "Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.", "I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox", "\"The Godfather\" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made": "\"The Godfather\" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made", "Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've": "I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.", "An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World": "\"The Godfather\" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching \"The Godfather,\" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, \"Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.\"That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, \"It's strictly business\" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a \"cold hearted bastard\" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like \"The Godfather,\" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.", "perfect": "I like this film because this film very honest so maybe like you their?", "Magnificent portrait of organized crime": "This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..", "Everything you've ever heard is true...": "THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.", "The Geatest Movie Ever Made": "You can't really criticize a film like \"The Godfather\", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, \"The Godfather\" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen \"The Godfather\" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a \"Moustache\" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. \"The Godfather\" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words \"required viewings.\"", "A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema": "Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10", "The Godfather make me an offer that I cannot refuse. This movie is a masterpiece.": "It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic.", "Amazing movie": "The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.", "A Masterpiece": "The Godfather is arguably THE defining drama motion picture of the 20th century. The character presentation was magnificent. Though Al Pacino had other great movies prior to this, Brando obviously took a shine to him and really mentored this actor in ways I believe no one can imagine. Pacino evolved and solidified the role of the head of the family that I believe is still being used in references today. A strong but loving Father figure, ruthless and forceful at times, Pacino drew on his personal background greatly during this role.James Caan was spot on as Sonny. The typical view of Italian temper as well as showing the eagerness to make a dollar. This role was the glue in the first half of the film. Talia Shire, just too good. What can one write about a flawless performance. The quintessential bad Italian daughter, awful wife and terrible sister. Scorned by her brother, bitter in the end of this movie, Mrs. Shire is wonderful in portraying the suppressed spirit of the true Italian mob family member.John Cazale is a piece of work. As Fredo, he embodies the mob family's image of the family member \"you should have just given money to instead of letting him in the business\". What a smart role for a great actor. Through it all Fredo was the one family member that was actually true to himself the whole time. He loved his family dearly, wanted to earn money, and absolutely craved respect. I love how he was always like the lamb in the lions den no one worried too much about. The movie was tailored such that if one thinks about it, the family is the one that let Fredo down by not recognizing his inherent shortcomings.Robert Duvall is a Master Counselor in the movie, but most the important contribution Duvall made was as an outsider. Not an Italian. His portrayal as someone who could be loyal and not blood Italian was huge in the USA at this time. I believe Duvall's role made it almost OK for races to interact with each other better without using side glances. This is a great testament to Duvall and one I don't believe was intended by the director or screenplay.Finally there is Mr. Marlo Brando. There's nothing to say but marvelous, magnificent, platinum performance.", "The Don And His Sons": "My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an \"offer he can't refuse\", or \"Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes\" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played.", "The Godfather": "My mom was watching The Godfather. She liked it a lot.", "Simply the best": "There are some movies for youth, some for the old people, some for women, some for men, etc... but The Godfather is the one that can be seen by anyone cause its message of life is understood by the whole world. Is the best movie of all time and represents an spectacular piece of work for any actor or director.", "The world inside the underworld!": "The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy", "Great look at a family based around crime": "Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share \u0096 that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.Pacino is great \u0096 he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime \u0096 people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list \u0096 long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are \u0096 but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.

Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic.", "The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.": "This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems \"too old or young for the part\". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem \"out of place\" or \"unconvincing\". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS \"The Godfather Saga\" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.", "The godfather": "The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family.

That's not to say that the other actors don't deserve recognition; each character is believable and realistic.I am not going to spoil much of the story; it's fairly simple, but there are a few twists and turns.The score by Nino Rota is great, and has now become a classic. The main theme is very memorable.The direction by Francis Ford Coppala is just genius. Each shot is done beautifully. The opening sequence for example, is just great, starting with a close-up of a minor character and slowly zooming out until you see a glimpse of The Godfather.

The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.", "A masterpiece": "Undoubtedly great piece of work and performance by each and every on great", "One Can See Why It's So Highly-Rated": "Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn't quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it's understandable. It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it's so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn't rate it as high as others was I didn't like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la \"Bonnie & Clyde,\" that was fine with me!There isn't as much violence as people might think, if they've never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That's part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its \"business.\"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own \"The Godfather Epic\" on tape, which must be some sort of collector's item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. It's well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I don't see it listed on IMDb.", "Truly a Masterpiece": "This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the \"Hated it\" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience.", "The Greatest Movie Ever Made": "Best gangster movie!!!This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.", "Good but overhyped": "I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.", "Count Me In The Minority": "First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought \"The Godfather\" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the eventual \"Don.\"It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10", "Dog Eat Dog...": "It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.", "Slightly overrated": "One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.\nFor starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.\nWhat's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred \"Goodfellas\". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10", "This Movie Has Haunted My Life...": "I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.", "Coppola made us a movie we can't refuse": "When people think of \"The Godfather\", they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling \"The Godfather\" a Mafia movie is like calling \"The Odyssey\" a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding: the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who's naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her: \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there's also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he's there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie's child. As soon as Michael \"renounces\" Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original.", "Monumental Film-Making and Arguably the Greatest Movie Ever.": "\"The Godfather\" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. \"The Godfather\" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.", "An absolute masterpiece from beginning to end": "Today, I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps in my film knowledge by watching one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed films of all time. I had picked up some of it by osmosis through references and parodies in other works but most of it was completely new to me, I'm glad to say. The acting, writing and direction are all of an extraordinarily high standard. It is a wonderfully told epic tale of family, betrayal, vengeance and a twisted sense of honour. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" \u2013 in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while \"The Godfather Part II\" was the second \u2013 in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando.James Caan is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her. The film's cinematography is beautiful. I particularly loved the frequent use of shadow and darkness. The long takes, one of my favourite film techniques, are not of the same duration as in the films of Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh but they are used very effectively. My absolute favourite scene in the film is the baptism of Connie's son Michael which is interspersed with a series of brutal murders. Not only is it shot in a fantastic way but it provides another great contrast as well as illustrating Michael's descent.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which lives up to the hype.", "Respect": "Spoilers herein.Building a life in film is not so much a matter of discovering the worthwhile films, but choosing which of those have the stuff worth building with. I have a clear understanding of what Scorsese is about, which I attribute to the Latin convention for storytelling. This convention is totally invested in characters, not situation or place or God help us, ideas. Scorsese's camera is attached to people, never place. His curiosity is always about people. This is a form of visual gossip that I eschew.So it is with Coppola. But his two projects (the Godfather and Apocalypse journeys) have another merit in how they work with what came before. Apocalypse is far more interesting in this respect. But `Godfather' is very clever in how it places itself. Gangster pictures began as a matter of a pretend world, and became ever more so as the genre matured. Mobsters lived in a world not unlike that of the Roadrunner,  always at a distance from reality, often winking at the audience.Coppola took his focus on the human to this genre. The film itself is no masterpiece without this placement, but is great with it. We inherit all the machinery and momentum of the genre to place behind the characters. Brando understood this, and alone is able to effect the transferral. Pacino would go on to sledgehammer his roles, but is appropriately subdued here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.", "A Legitimately Perfect Film": "Really what more about The Godfather can I say that hasen't already been said?Everything about this movie is perfectly executed and incredibly well put together. The characters are really what added that extra depth to the film. The first character I want to bring up is Sonny. Throughout the movie, you know him as an ignorant and almost childish person, yet when he is shot and killed, you feel immediate sympathy for him. And at the same time he is a determined member of their family business and also caring when the time is needed for that trait to be exposed (ex: when Vito nearly dies in the first act). And when Vito is looking down at his dead body, you really feel for them even though someone like Vito may come across like an incredibly serious and emotionless man. But what they accomplished was, not making him another one dimensional Mafia/mob boss, but someone who legitimately cares for his family. The way they introduce him in the beginning of the film is very well conducted and shows the audience how intimidating he is and the impact he has on other people in what he says and how his word/opinion is extremely important to people. Brando is incomparable in his role and is irreplaceable as his role as Don Corleone.My favorite aspect of this movie, however, is seeing the riveting transition of Michael Corleone throughout the film. They first introduce Michael as someone who wants nothing to do with the family business, but is eventually the new Don replacing his father at the end of the film. Wow! What a transformation! He is a former Marine who is committed to living a normal, happy life with his wife Kay. However Michael eventually gets involved in the criminal empire after Vito is shot and almost killed. This leads up to the best scene, in my opinion, of the movie. Michael goes out to a restaurant with Sollozzo, the head of one of the rival families of the Corleones, the Tattaglias, in addition to Police Captain McCluskey, with intentions to kill both of them. He does after contemplating it in his head, and this is an incredibly important scene because it is the start of Michael's transition into the new Don we see at the end of the movie. It was not rushed in any way and that's another great aspect of the film. It's nearly three hours long, but it's necessary for the person watching it to be fully immersed into the story and characters. The ending is really well directed and thought out because without any explanation, you know what just happened as soon as someone kisses Michael's hand, which was shown earlier in the film but to Vito, a gesture only given to the Don. Al Pacino gave a great performance and so did every single other person in the movie. Perfect casting all around.I think one performance that is very undervalued is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. He plays a super important role in the movie, but is not quickly thought of by most people. He was a side character, but incorporated well in the film as the advisor for Vito, and later Michael.Many Of the characters in the movie and constantly conflicted with themselves and they display it very well. The entire story is one of the best ever put to the big screen and the praise that it's gotten over all these years are very deserving. The way they utilize lighting in the film is also very important such as every scene of Vito in his office at the beginning of the film is constantly lit dark showing the fear people feel when entering his office and the seriousness of situations involving him. This also applies to Vito's soft spoken voice demonstrating how intimidating he comes off as without screaming for example. A vast majority of the film, basically the entire 2nd and 3rd acts, with the exception of the very beginning with the wedding to go also how with the 1st act, are all lit dim, in dark tones. On the other hand, Michael, in the beginning of the film, is shown in the bright daylight outside talking with his girlfriend, an excellent contrast between him and the rest of his family.Great acting, great script, and all put into great hands that made it as amazing as it is even 40 years later.RATING: 10.0/10", "Mario Puzo's soapy Mafia saga": "Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s.", "What is there to say?": "Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.", "Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.": "The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way\u0085The film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.", "How things were done back then!": "The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.", "Allow \"The Godfather\" to make you an offer you can't refuse": "\"The Godfather\" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.Is \"The Godfather\" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.", "\"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\"": "A rare bit of humor within the trilogy and shows how nonchalant mob killings can be.Right after a mob driver is murdered in a car after conspiring with the Tattaglia family against the Corleone's, Peter Clemenza says the infamous line after he had already agreed to bring the tasty Italian pastry desserts home for his wife.Supposedly, \"leave the gun\" was the scripted portion and Italian actor Richard Castellano improvised the \"take the cannoli\" portion.It just goes to show in their world, weapons are commonplace and desserts are definitely more important!", "A flawless masterpiece": "So, those of you who haven't seen it may wonder, \"What's so good about the Godfather? Why is it that this, out of every movie ever made, is considered by so many people to be one of the if not the all-time best?\" Allow me to explain as best I can. It's the kind of movie where everything is perfect. Everything. The acting, the script, the pacing, the cinematography, right down to the soundtrack. All of it.Oh, sure, it's a leisurely movie. It clocks in at just under three hours, and the plot takes a while to unfold. But it is NOT \"slow\" or \"boring.\" While not a suspense film in the traditional sense, the movie is definitely suspenseful, and I have to applaud Coppola for his excellent use of tension building. In other words, he uses the three-hour length of the film perfectly: there's not a wasted minute among these 175, not a single bit I'd take out.And besides, the acting is great. Just awesome. Brando's performance is stunning; the guy just oozes cool, as he always does. He's magnetic as Vito Corleone, arguably his most famous role ever. And, of course, Al Pacino's Michael Corleone deserves nothing but the highest of praise. It was the guy's big break, and he does a fantastic job displaying Michael's ruthless, cunning, coldly intelligent rise to power. The two of them pretty much make the movie, but even people playing bit parts give their all, resulting in a movie that makes mobsters seem very human. Special shout-out to Robert Duvall for his excellent turn as Tom \"Badass\" Hagen, and Diane Keaton (one of my favorite actresses, I'll add) as Michael's girlfriend and moral compass Kay. Having been mostly familiar with her for her roles in those classic Woody Allen movies, I had no idea she could carry a dramatic role, but she does an excellent job. And the script is just awesome, including a couple classic lines.Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\" And, of course, \"He made him an offer he couldn't refuse.\" A whole ton of memorable ones. Actually, pretty much every line in this movie is quotable, and given its three-hour length, that's pretty impressive. And that theme song... oh man. One of the best ever written.A note also must be made on the baptism scene. All aspiring filmmakers should watch this movie for a lot of reasons, but for that scene in particular. The building of tension, the symbolism, the sacred-profane juxtaposition, the heart-stopping climax... perfect. The scene encapsulates everything I love about the movie into just a few minutes.And that's the Godfather for you. It's bleak, tender, touching, violent, thoughtful, occasionally horrifying (the famed horse head scene, anyone?), and sometimes even darkly funny. It's a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. This, and its sequel for that matter, is a movie for the ages. Basically, if it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it's got Robert Duvall in it, you're in for a fantastic movie. That's a good rule of thumb. And the book it's based on is just as good!", "A Must-See For All Generations": "\"The Godfather\" has been a title so beloved and entirely embraced as a significant, cultural phenomenon, that in a certain level demands of you to watch it with full recommendations off of it. Especially if you're young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the \"greatest movie in history\" did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleone's first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons: early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. Then, everything goes down the drain: someone attempts to kill the Godfather. It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he can't run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new \"Godfather\" and immediately seems to be a changed man.Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.I guess the only issue with this movie is it's running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but it's the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who. And that is the reason I suggest we stick to the father-son relationship and not worry about certain aspects and scenes we don't understand or just keep asking \"who is that guy talking\"?This is the \"Godfather\" that everyone is talking about for decades, and if you don't like what you hear in the very first scene in that dark room, I warn you... turn of the picture and don't watch anymore. Come back a few years later when you could probably handle it.On the other hand, you must ask yourself: can you feel the zest for respect and loyalty when Don Corleone whispers his lines? Don't you yearn for the moral and innocent Micheal as the movie goes? Can you sympathize with Kay when the door closes at the end? Then \"The Godfather\" got you where it should have.", "Classic": "That it is. Fantastic set design and performances all around.", "Arguably the greatest of all mob films": "Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made because to me it was a pitch perfect mafia film that definitely compares to the greatness of Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990), and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) but so much better than those two great films put together. The best summary for this film would be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time is going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone family leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al Pacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s best supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having the most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films talk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in common is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can be in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood this film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by Brando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo. Coppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some instances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the perfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really disagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando rejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he gave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola didn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think he deserved it. But in the end this film is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish.", "Simply a great classic, number one on many lists.": "I was fortunate to see \"The Godfather\" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many \"gangster\" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about \"family\" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have \"The Godfather\" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a \"gang family\" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me \"One From The Heart\", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", another \"family\" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. \"The Godfather\" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan.", "A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus": "The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/", "THE crime epic of the 20th century.": "\"The Godfather\" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "The Greatest Cast For A Movie Ever.": "Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. \"The Godfather\" is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter's Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse's head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldn't have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say \"Falls from grace\" is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich \"Sepia\" toned movie.Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. \"The Godfather\", has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brando's or Pachino's? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the \"Love theme\" all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppola's efforts.Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: \"Probably the finest cast ever assembled\". 10/10.", "Filmmaking At Its Most Perfect, Genuine, Complete, Crystalline & Pure.": "Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended.", "an unforgetable film": "This movie alongside Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Godfather:part II, The Third Man and Lawrence Of Arabia is my absolutely favorite film. Some scenes you just can't forget. Vito's character is one of the best played roles in movies history (done by Marlon Brando). This story about Corleone family (together with part 2 and 3) is the greatest movie epic ever made.", "Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice": "The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original \"Movie Brats\" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter.

The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic.", "\"For justice, we must go to Don Corleone\".": "Lately it seems, \"The Godfather\" has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don't see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I've never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it's theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There's a good reason why. I don't think there's ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the 'sleeps with the fishes' calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn't Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! Quite simply, \"The Godfather\" is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931's \"Little Caesar\" and \"Public Enemy\". For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that it's impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of it's supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.There has been enough written about the film that I don't need to get into the story itself. I'll content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonny's job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michael's restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagen's ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devil's work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that can't be refused. With \"The Godfather\", it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of it's parts. So I'll content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli\". For cinema fans, \"The Godfather\" is all cannoli.", "Oh, Those Corleones....": "No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two \"Godfather\" films, \"The Conversation,\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\" \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\", the third \"Godfather\") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before \"Jack\" there was \"The Godfather.\" While I feel the whole \"Godfather\" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. \"The Godfather\" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, \"The Godfather\" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-", "a classic when first released; only improves with age": "The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (\"I believe in America\") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.", "Sets the standard for the gangster art film.": "The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film \"auteur.\" Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and \"legitimate\" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding \"favor,\" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune,\" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: \"for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.\"Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: \"My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.\"\"Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now.\" \"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.\" And most famously of all: \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, \"Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!\" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). \"Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,\" he relates, \"and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me.\" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as \"Senator Corleone\" or \"Governor Corleone\" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (\"prince of darkness\") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes \u0096 especially in the Don's home office \u0096 with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that \"crime did not pay.\" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.", "No Movie is the Best Movie Ever": "One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.", "A little over rated, but I know good film making when I see it": "I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget \"The Godfather\".9/10", "'The Godfather' to be called the greatest movie of all time is a fair judgment": "The last time I watched the Godfather I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 and I didn't particularly love it and so I was disappointed. I wasn't looking forward to sitting through this 3 hour movie once more but I'm definitely glad that I did as the second time, the whole story became so much easier to understand.The Godfather is simply a movie that deals with the crime business within the Corleone family. The summary given on IMDb doesn't seem accurate to me as it simply deals with the lives of Michael and Vito Corleone, as well as Sonny and Tom Hagen.The greatest strength in the movie is EVERYTHING! I LOVE IT! The acting in the movie is pretty much, beyond explanation with words. Marlon Brando is absolutely a genius of an actor playing Vito, one of my favorite movie characters. Al Pacino did a fantastic job playing the young war hero, Michael Corleone. The only bit of a weakness in terms of acting was Diane Keaton, but it doesn't bother me one little bit.The writing and direction in the movie is superb. Every scene is executed at top notch and this movie is simply a great explanation of what a great movie should be like and clearly defines Francis Coppola as a superb director. The dialogue is entertaining, and unlike the first time, no scene in the movie bored me one little bit. I love the whole movie and honestly, it felt half its running time The characters in the movie are just brilliantly conjured up. They are all so great in their own ways and each have their own personalities making them unique. I love Vito, Michael, Tom, Sonny, Kay, Sollozo, the corrupted cop and everyone, including such minor characters.***SPOILERS*** When Luca Brasi and Sonny were killed off, that left such a strange feeling of emotion in me. Luca Brasi seemed like such a warrior of a man and seeing that Sonny was killed when he was on his way to kill Carlo for his actions against Connie was just heartbreaking.However, no moment in movie history affected me the same way that this scene did and that is the classic scene with Marlon Brando's Vito playing with his grandson in the garden and abruptly, falling dead. It was so beautifully done. In any other movie, this scene would feel so unrealistic that you wouldn't buy it, the fact that a mob leader's final moments were playing with his grandson but here, the scene is executed to the perfect level. It is in fact, my favorite scene of the movie The scene where Connie and Carlo's character is being baptized at the end was just a brilliant scene and was great to see some bloody action at the end of the film. The final scene with Michael lying to Kay about Carlo's murder was great and when the heads of the families meet in his room and call him 'Don Corleone' is perhaps the greatest ending to any movie along with the Empire Strikes Back **END OF SPOILERS*** In conclusion, upon my second viewing, I can gladly say that the Godfather totally deserves to be called the best movie of all time in every way possible though it may not necessarily be mine. My Flickchart list reports this movie as my 6th highest and it all comes for good reason. Superb directing, action, writing, characters and story totally pay off as this 3 hour movie for me, feels more like a 90 minute film!", "The Greatest, no questions asked": "Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is \"The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces\" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the \"Corleone Family Mafia\". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie.", "\"He is a good godson.\"": "This film has spawned so many gangster clich\u00e9s and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people \"sleeping with da fishies\" or \"making an offer you can't refuse,\" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)", "An Offer You Don't Want To Refuse": "\"The Godfather's\" greatness extends beyond my ability to sing its praises, so there's not much insight I can offer. Except this: If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. \"The Godfather\" has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of \"deep-thought\" pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in. Pacino, Brando, and Lettieri could all be big actors, but they all keep it contained here, especially Brando whose opening scene as the Don sets the bar very high. James Caan is the closest this movie has to an outsized performance, as Michael's hot-tempered older brother Sonny, but even he only boils up once in a while. The phrase \"It's not personal, it's business,\" comes up a few times in this movie, and the scary thing is it really is for them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And if you have already, and didn't think it was that great, see it again. You may wind up as amazed as me at what a difference a second viewing can make.", "Perhaps the Greatest of All Time?": "I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up! In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10.", "Not sure": "I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.But i never get into it.The plot is ok but i wanted more.I wanted to go deeper into the \"why\" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.They just \"looked\" and there was silence.I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called \"masterpiece\". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly \"bored\".I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.", "The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art": "Greetings from Lithuania.To call \"The Godfather\" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.", "The American Dream & One of the Greatest Films Ever Made": "THE GODFATHER (1972) **** Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, John Marley, Talia Shire, Richard Conte, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Al Martino, Alex Rocco. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley \"an offer he can't refuse\" resulting with a horse's head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan's hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of \"Bonnie and Clyde\") and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael's' godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life). Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor (all losing to Joel Grey in \"Cabaret\"). Kudos also to make-up guru Dick Smith for his realistic old age make up on Brando and also to Nina Rota's famous haunting foreboding score.", "\"I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse\"": "When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film \"a long, boring piece of crap.\" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, \"never take sides against the family.\" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl\u0085..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-", "A view from the other side of life.": "The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.", "One of the all time greatest": "There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale.The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and always will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent public loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when they happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look at the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it in his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission. Oh yeah, he's one of the good guys though, so it's okay!Everything is explored in the Godfather, either directly or subtly; family politics, gangland negotiation, corrupt officials, there is no part of the mafia experience that is not pictured here, taken from the viewpoint of Michael, a character whose transition from unwilling family outsider and war-hero into the don himself really gives the film a unique perspective.Of course, for me, out of all the fantastic characters, the film is carried by Marlon Brando. There is something magnetic about his performance, a mixture of loving family man, ruthless career criminal, and sophisticated Sicilian gentleman, that is thrilling to watch. One of the all time greatest acting performances.", "The godfather of American cinema": "The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of them all and it's not difficult to see why. It is a bit clich\u00e9 to like this movie, but it really does deserve it. Al Pacino plays the son of the head of a crime family who, following an assassination attempt on his father, rises up to become the head of the family, despite previously wanting nothing to do with his family's criminal activities. Aside from the slightly excessive length and the fact that the film made the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack And Jill even more painful, The Godfather is one of the few films which could be seen as borderline perfect. Like many great movies, it requires patience. The film draws its audience in slowly as it gets better and more intense as it progresses and by the extremely sad ending there is a sense of awe and genuine astonishment at the quality and power of the movie. It beats Citizen Kane, the other general choice for the best movie ever made. One of the first things to set it apart is the amazing cast, although Marlon Brando is a bit difficult to understand.The direction is excellent as well, as Francis Ford Coppola's filmmaking isn't showy and visually stunning like in Apocalypse Now, but it's more subtle and restrained and draws the viewer in. The dramatic moments are handled brilliantly, and having a great script to work with certainly doesn't hurt either. What makes the film a success isn't any of the above, but the storyline. The story is perfectly structured, and gets better and better as the film progresses. Not only does it have a multitude of brilliant movie moments, it also has many jaw dropping and startling outbreaks of violence, with the multiple assassinations/baptism finale being one of the best movie moments in the history of the medium. Michael Corleone's conversion into the head of his crime family is very sad, and the movie is overall proof that a family drama can still be thrilling, moving and have people queuing around the block. I don't usually agree with the best picture winners, but this is one which totally deserved to win. Like I said earlier, it's a clich\u00e9 to love this movie but it really does deserve it.10/10", "Such a freaking classic.": "Don Vito Corleone: \"You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?\". The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is.", "The Godfather is my favourite film of all time": "A family, the Don, everyone knows him, everyone knows of his power, here is the end of his era and simply the beginning of another, we a fantastic look into a family, into a style of life. It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, \"nothing personal\", here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new \"chapter\" in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse. The cast is simply perfect, the voice of Brando, the strange charisma of James Caan as Santino, one of Pacino's best performances, simply each actor/actress is fantastic giving life to all those memorable characters. My very first experience with The Godfather was not a really long time ago, was in 2005 and I came to them together with some members of my family who like me had never seen by then any of the three films, I loved The Godfather and in 2006 I read the novel by Mario Puzo. I remember not having clear in my mind each detail of the film when I started reading the novel, by then I had seen only once The Godfather. I loved the novel and after reading it I went to another one by Puzo, The Last Don and I loved it also. So after this I remember having this sort of Mafia summer by watching first the miniseries based on The Last Don and later watching again The Godfather trilogy. This film has become the one I love the most, its long runtime feels like nothing, I watched it a lot of times back in 2006 once I had read the novel, fantastic. I received for Christmas the Coppola Restoration four-disc set on Blu-ray, while I haven't seen yet Part II and III (and the new bonus material) on Blu-ray this part looks so beautiful, in short you remember how it looks the blood of Moe Greene (during that memorable baptism sequence)? Well on Blu-ray it finally looks like blood!PD: my very first IMDb comment was precisely for The Godfather. While I'm not at all ashamed or anything like that about it I don't like it either so I decided to delete it and write another one. I was going to put it here just because it was my very first comment but thanks to the words limit I can't. I will put it on my message board profile.", "The Godfather is a good movie": "I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also.", "\"Don't ever take sides against the family again.\"": "Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.What's indicative of how powerful \"The Godfather\" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.Followed by two sequels, \"The Godfather\" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.10 out of 10.", "A work of art.": "Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.", "The GODFATHER what else can i say ?": "The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).", "Great But Overrated Movie!": "I really liked \"The Godfather\" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.", "The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.": "I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.", "The best movie by far.": "So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.", "A real classic in the crime genre": "There are many mafia movies out there but The Godfather truly stands out among them. And it is not great just because it is one of the first movies in the crime genre but also because of it's great cinematography and outstanding storytelling .If you retell the plot to someone it will sound like it is extremely dull. It's just the story of how a son takes over his father's business. But the way the movie presents this plot (with many betrayals and deaths) makes it great and memorable.The acting is not always good. In some scenes it is extremely bad. Take the scene where Connie starts breaking utensils. The acting in this scene is so bad that when it comes up while I'm watching the movie, I just turn my head away. Of course I should metion that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino do a great job. Their acting is outstanding and deserves the pride it gets.The Godfather is truly a classic in the crime genre that must be on everyone's top movies list.", "\"I am going to make him an offer he can't refuse\"": "Adapted from a Mario Puzo novel, The Godfather has had the most extreme change in views for me, until a couple of weeks I despised it but that was before I rewatched it and now I love it. I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema.", "The Pioneer of All Filmmaking": "The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model. The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast! The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome.", "The King Of Mob Movies": "The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10.", "Best Movie Of All Time": "Best Recommended for everyone interested in action movies.Absolutely a must watch movie of all time. Don Vito Corleone, head of a mafia family, decides to hand over his empire to his youngest son Michael. However, his decision unintentionally puts the lives of his loved ones in grave danger.", "Hard to refuse": "It could be said that the film-adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel marked the beginning of a new era, as it established talents hitherto unknown to the wider public, including Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and director Francis Ford Coppola. Furthermore, THE GODFATHER is often thought of as a \"comeback\" to Marlon Brando, which apparently puzzled the actor himself, as he pointed out in his autobiography that he'd been doing movies without considerable intermission for the last twenty-or-so years. However, the claim may not have been so unreasonable after all, as the role of Vito Corleone made Brando truly sought-after again. By the time Brando embarked on the role, no major studios would hire him due to a reputation for being \"impossible\" to work with, and Coppola was only able to convince Paramount that the actor was simply tailor-made for the part and could not be neglected by having him do a screen-test first. Considering that Brando had once revolutionized acting in America through his raw, unmasked portrayals of Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy in the 1950's, this procedure may sound shocking, but once accomplished, Brando proved that he remained the king of acting in the end. His portrayal of Corleone may strike us as being somewhat of a caricature today, as it has been endlessly imitated (and parodied) since, but Brando did in fact attribute the character with far more attention to complex detail than seen in a typical movie \"gangster-boss\" up till that time. That Brando's performance has now, in the eyes of younger generations such as my own, turned somewhat into a clich\u00e9 is simply the inevitable result of his initial originality.Also Pacino, Keaton, James Caan and Robert Duvall are, of course, quite outstanding in their roles. Particularly in Pacino's case, his handling of his character Michael Corleone's dramatic development as a person which is so crucial to the story, comes off as completely convincing. From being apparently a rather sympathetic character at the beginning, he changes as he becomes increasingly involved in his father's business life. It is this devoted focus on character development, as well as on how conflicting aspects of a personality interchange such as in Vito Corleone's case, that truly make the story so intriguing as it is. However, it is one thing to have a story of nearly endless potential, but this does not necessarily result in a successful cinematic interpretation of it. Other than outstanding performances, the direction of Francis Ford Coppolla is, of course, more than merely significant; even if one neglects the other qualities of the film, it may be treasured for its own sake, due to Coppolla's extremely competent, innovative techniques. There seems to be too many scenes and moments to pick out just one or two favorites; his ability to define the mood and atmosphere of a particular event through a painstaking attention to every single detail, is arguably of equal impact to the story as the performances of the actors, and make the film a visual delight. This is no less impressive when considering that THE GODFATHER was Coppolla's first major film; he was to establish himself further into the decade with other brilliant films such as THE CONVERSATION, APOCALYPSE NOW and this film's second act.When released in 1972, THE GODFATHER turned out to be, not surprisingly, one of the most widely-seen, lavishly- praised films in the history of the medium, and earned three Academy Awards out of eleven nominations (Marlon Brando's refusal to accept the award, due to the \"treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,\" has become famous in its own right). This is not to say, however, that THE GODFATHER is a film one is likely to grasp at first viewing; I, for one, did not quite understand its incredible reputation at first (though I did think it was a good film). Much as with CITIZEN KANE or BLADERUNNER, it is probably required to view THE GODFATHER through an historical context, and compare it to other films made around the same time, to get why it is so much adored. It helps matters that it's not only brilliantly made but really entertaining as well, so you're likely to have a good time no matter how you watch it.", "I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Give \"The Godfather\" 10 stars.": "I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). \"The godfather\" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in \"A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\") but I recognize that he made the role of \"vito corleone\" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.The best movie ever", "Overrated? Maybe a little bit.": "Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.", "Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again, ever.": "The Corleone family face a threat to their lives and business.This is one of the greatest movies of all time.I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.", "Perfection on film (with Godfather II as it's worthy companion piece ... Godfather III - Good not great.)": "To the (few) giving poor revues ... be very careful. It'll be a late night knock on your door or an invitation for coffee from an old 'friend' or maybe you'll be in a cinema watching Shawshank Redemption, then KAPOW! You'll be nothing more than a red smudge on the wallpaper.You must never go against the family.Correct your revue now or it will be you who's 'corrected'.", "I Know I'm In The Minority.....": "I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think \"The Godfather\" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather \"Don\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it. With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in \"Rocky\") and Diane Keaton. Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated", "The best film in movie history": "What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10.", "Simply the Greatest Movie Ever Made ...": "In the beginning, a young war hero tells his future wife, how his father helped a successful crooner in his career, by making his manager an offer he couldn't refuse : basically threatening him to death with a gun on his head. Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered: 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie. What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty: losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is : which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully: \"I'm with you, Pop\" and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.And \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of \"The Godfather\", that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of \"The Godfather\" has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved: the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography \u0085 every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel \u0085 How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible \u0085 Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them \u0085 But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series. The details are everywhere, in the script that enriched the cinematic language with so many iconic quotes, from delightful culinary parallels to other fishy metaphors \u0085 a script that transcended the novel, and made the film even more legendary.When it comes to defend \"The Godfather\", I'm the most passionate fan you'll ever find, but I prefer to prevent this review from an overdose of superlatives. I know the movie is the greatest, not because it's my personal belief, but because I can't see another movie to top it, whatever cinematic category I use : story, acting, casting, writing, scoring, editing, direction \u0085 I can find a movie better in every element but not in all of them, and beyond all this technicality \u0085 it's just a movie that grows on you, after so many viewings, that shines cinematic respect in every single frame. The greatest", "It is indeed a true classic and one of the best films out there however best movie of all time i would have to say NO! *Spoilers*": "It is indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there, however best movie of all time i would have to say no. It does indeed deserve it's reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it's very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It's a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone's bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino's performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino's wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don't go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5", "Mafia 101": "The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.", "It is great, but hardly the best": "I finally set out to take three hours to watch \"the best movie ever\" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.8/10", "\"I believe in America\"": "'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part \u0096 and there are a lot of them \u0096 has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando \u0096 in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback \u0096 gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive \"family honour.\" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.", "ONE OF THE BEST EVER!": "AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.", "It's Not Worthy of number 1": "I have just seen it, for the first time. \u00a320 for the first 2 Godfather films and Fight Club on DVD, i figured that's got to be worth it for such acclaimed movies.Strong performances from Pacino, Caan and Duvall do lend realism to the plot, but i have to say i found Brando's mumbled dialogue really annoying (Authentic? - Maybe? Acclaimed?) but still annoying, and i was disappointed to find he still had a part to play in the film, even after the film maker's had him shot.The movie does have some fine moments (the horses head, Pacino's restaurant scene, Sonny's death) all good scenes, but when interlaced with tediously drawn out rubbish (The opening 20mins YAWN, Pacino's entire time spent in hiding, YAWN) I couldn't help but wish for the film to end.At nearly 3 hours long, the movie could have easily been trimmed by a hour and not lost anything, in summary this film has brilliance mixed with tedium and simply doesn't deserve its place in the number 1 spot.I hope part 2 is better, because part 1 has not inspired me to watch it, maybe when i have nothing else to do i will. Thank god Fight Club's a winner.6/10 Watch Goodfellas instead (It makes this film look timid)", "This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.": "The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.", "In the dictionary under masterpiece": "Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why \"The Godfather\"is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about. I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in. This is an epic in every sense of the word.9/10", "an obvious word: masterpiece": "The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his \"business\" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.", "The film of films": "A flawless movie.

It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.", "Good film but not worth its ratings.": "It contains good actors, effects, sounds, music & direction but its not a film that should be considered as the best film of all time.

Or 97% on rt.But its a great film that i can watch multiple times. And i like the music. I wouldnt say its bad.

I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones!

You can read my review of the \"The Last Don\" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same\u0085Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root! What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!", "\"It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane\"\"": "I can understand on why \"The Godfather\" is being regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, if not the greatest by some professionals. \"The Godfather\" is the soul of a perfected cinema, one that will be looked upon by passionate students, and one that will be studied for generations. It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane\". Even its formidable sequel never holds the same kind of stature. To admire \"The Godfather\", is to celebrate American cinema, or just simply movies.Some time ago, I told a friend that \"The Godfather\" is a great example of a 'complete' movie, and my opinion stays in that manner still. It has everything a movie requires: cinematography, acting, editing, screenplay, directing and obviously, a glorious plot. 'Overrated' is the term adopted by some for \"The Godfather\", and my assumption is that either he dislikes the picture, or he lacks the understanding to realise the wonders of the medium. \"The Godfather\" is the first great film I caught. It is the initiator of my love for cinema. Undoubtedly, the film will always have a special place in my heart.What began and seemed like a happy family, plunges into darkness too quickly. The joy and light at the beginning are merely silhouettes of the Corleone family. Sonny's (James Caan) trifling with adultery, and the show of his temper, a man asking for murder, an unholy loyalty, and Michael's (Al Pacino) telling of his father's ways of abusing power - all these are signs shown by Coppola on the dangers that will rain down upon them. One who flirts with sin, will face a punishment.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is the head of the family, is a very powerful and influential figure. With considerable loyalty that his friends pay for him, he holds the power to accomplish his ambitions. \"The Godfather\" serves introductions to the Corleone family, and only with the arrival of a narcotic baron, a spark of its drama, lighted. Although Vito portrays the main character of the story, I treat it such that the Corleone family is the 'protagonist' instead, with their businesses and goals are the greatest displays of the story.My favourite moment is a scene where Michael places his sick father in a hidden room to avoid a possible assassination. And Vito's tears flow down his cheek upon discovering that his son, has performed with utmost sincerity to keep him safe. That part, clearly magnified a genuine father-son relationship and too, the sheer love that Vito has for Michael and also a magnificent clue that Michael is the right person to succeed his father as the head of the family. No matter how villainous, or powerful or influential Vito may be, he is still an ordinary father who preserves love for his children.The movie opens up relationships between the people in the family. To witness Sonny embracing his brother, Michael, before the disinclined departure, says a lot about the soft spoken allegiance he has for Michael. And also it brings to light about loyalty and protectiveness within. Not only the story painted picture of aggressiveness of the organisation, but also about characters, that men carry.James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and the rest from the cast delivers perfect performances that have made \"The Godfather\" to be inarguably one of the best acted films in history. Marlon might already have passed terrific performances for his earlier movies like \"On the Waterfront\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", but his work for the \"The Godfather\" transcended all these. His embodiment of an old, fading Don gives life for excellence and the body of an acting genius. Al Pacino is responsible for the convincing but subtle transformation of Michael from an innocent war hero, to a cold, hard \u2013 hitting Don. That effortless changeover by Pacino is a marvellous piece of acting. John Marley is terrific as the outspoken movie producer but a very short screen time was given for him, and his performance is severely underrated.There is \"The Godfather\", living under the shades of cinematic greatness. The legacy and influence that the movie brings, endures till today. It is pretty much ironic that the greatest gangster movie is actually the one that romanticises the subject, not the ones that vomit the brutalities that many find a strong connection in between. Coppola made a statement that sounds like the movie is actually \"an accidental success\". I refuse to believe in that. I believe that the geniuses of Coppola, the actors, the writer and the filmmakers involved, that have had truly made \"The Godfather\" a timeless masterpiece.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall", "I Don't Think It's THE Greatest. I Think It's ALMOST The Greatest.": "Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more \"best of\" lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being \"the greatest of all time.\" It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando's greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando's performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I'm glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions.The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family: the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people \"an offer they can't refuse.\" When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito's youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who's who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings.The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando's last monumental film and Pacino's first. I don't recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor.4/4", "with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, \"The Godfather\" easily scores as one of the best films ever made": "When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece \"The Godfather\" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called \"The Godfather\" a candidate for the best movie ever made and \"without a doubt, the best cast.\" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.\"The Godfather\" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, \"The Godfather\" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.But of course, \"The Godfather\" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in \"The Godfather\" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.\"The Godfather\" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until \"Jaws\" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Vertigo\" (1958), and \"Spartacus\" (1960), \"The Godfather\" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.", "An examination of the Mafia from the view of the executive suite": "The Godfather films (the first two at least) are operatic in their intent and are as sweeping in their view of the human condition as any American film ever made. They are not violent slice-of-life character-driven action films like Goodfellas or \"The Sopranos,\" which are a superb film and an extremely watchable cable series, respectively. The Godfather is, to my mind, superior filmmaking because of its propulsive narrative and iconic characters.What makes \"The Godfather\" great is that the characters in it know they are doing evil things, but rationalize it to themselves that \"the end justifies the means\". Coppola makes the hypocrisy and utterly failed values system pretty clear. A baptism inter-cut with scenes of murder...Vito Corleone is at his daughter's wedding, but sits there planning brutal mob stuff in his office...leave the gun take the cannoli...OK to cheat on your wife but \"dont discuss business at the table\" and so on.I had to watch this movie several times before I completely \"got\" it. The plot alone is very difficult to follow with all of the questions it raises. However it is one of those movies that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character. The questions are about how people who regard themselves as \"good\" can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. \"The Godfather\" posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms? How can people who do evil things think of themselves as basically \"good\" , how can they lie to themselves as they do?Central to all of this is the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone. He starts out as the returned all American WWII soldier with the respectable but outsider (in reference to \"The Family\") girlfriend, Kay, and by just doing what he thinks he must do to protect his family, one thing leads to another, and he ends up the cynical head of the Corleone crime family, morally miles from where he was when we first meet him.", "One of the Greatest Mafia movies that I ever watched": "I watched various Gangster movies, from the City of God to Goodfellas; the Godfather was one of the greatest movies I ever watched, with Brutal Killing scenes and excellent Performances.", "Regarded a classic for good reason, Coppola's crime epic is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.": "Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10", "Timeless Mafia Film.": "Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.A masterpiece.", "Cinematic Classic": "The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola) Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)", "Brando's aged make-up is incredible": "Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time\u0085 There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.", "VERY good, but not the best...": "...\"The Godfather\", as everyone knows, is a classic.  It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties.  It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.\"The Godfather\" is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  \"The Godfather\" is the best crime drama.  \"Casablanca\" is the best romance.  \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Star Wars\" movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like \"The Godfather\", \"Casablanca\", \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Star Wars\" are the reason movies are so popular.Enjoy, 9/10.", "Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.": "So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.Coppolas best film is \"Apocalypse, Now\". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.", "One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.": "The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.", "ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.": "My Rating : 10/10 \u2660 MASTERPIECE \u2660'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.", "Best film ever made": "I don't really know what to add to the reviews of this film to make my review worth reading. The Godfather is a so well done, masterfully crafted film that deserves to be the Top 1 film in IMDB. Well it's not that far since it's ranking n. 2 as of now. I am a film lover and I have watched some amazing movies, many good ones, but also too many that disappointed me. I can honestly say that The Godfather is far beyond being amazing. The Godfather stands out in many ways: acting, cinematography, directing, soundtrack, story and of course production design, which is flawless. I've watched it 3 times and I know that, soon enough, I will watch it again.", "One of the greats, if not the great.": "There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.", "Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.": "Despite having essentially no italian heritage, Marlon Brando will forever be remembered by millions all over the world as Don Corleone, the mafia boss and main character from one of the greatest movies ever made, period. When it was released in the early 70s, this film was for a time the highest grossing movie ever made and easily eclipsed the money accumulated by other movies produced that same year. Before the sequel (and the less impressive third movie), there was the original mob boss played by Brando who was just the right amount of threatening and respectable. After all these years, this movie still inspires many people around the world to become filmmakers for a number of reasons. It is very long and technically impressive to look at, employs a large number of actors and extras, has great dialogue and acting, and most importantly, has a story that never fails to entertain no matter how much time passes. As you might gather from the title, The Godfather is about the patriarch of an immensely powerful family of underworld criminals, but he is getting old, and maybe it's time for a new leader to be selected. The story begins in 1940s New York, where Vito Corleone (Brando) is attending a wedding for his daughter Connie. When Johnny (Vito's godson) wants his help in playing a part in a film, he sends a man named Tom to LA to get the part secured for him. One of the executives refuses and wakes up some time later with the severed head of a horse under his blankets. Later, around Christmastime, Vito and his family cause more crime-related incidents when someone asks him to inject more money into a drug business, which Vito turns down. One of Vito's men is strangled to death when he is sent to see what they're up to. Later, Vito is shot outside, but survives. His oldest son Sonny is now in control of the family, and his other son Michael (Al Pacino) kills two guys in a restaurant after retrieving a handgun from a bathroom that was placed there earlier. Violence erupts between Vito's family and a rival gang, which leads to many of his relatives fearing for their lives. Michael travels to Sicily, and Sonny is murdered by people armed with machine guns when he tries to kill a rival. Meanwhile in the mediterranean, Michael meets a girl named Apollonia, but she's killed when a bomb hidden in a car blows up. Vito now realizes he's in serious trouble as his rivals were able to find and kill Sonny. Basically admitting defeat, he tells the rival gang he will not oppose their heroin operation and will not take revenge for Sonny's demise. Michael marries his longtime girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) after returning home, but by the mid 50s, Vito's time is running out. He soon suffers a heart attack, and Corleone gangsters murder the rival mob bosses in New York City, all of this taking place on the same day as the baptism of Connie's child. With this accomplished, Michael is now in charge of the Corleone family, and is ready to fulfill his task of becoming just as feared as his father was. There are so many reasons why this movie is incredible that I can't possibly fit them all into a review, but one reason is that the opening wedding ceremony was recorded a few minutes from where I live. I'm not going to say where it is, but it's easy enough to find out. The casting and acting here is all remarkable, with the most prominent being Brando and Al Pacino. It's thanks to their stellar performances as Vito and Michael respectively that cemented both of them as gangster icons for decades to come. Of course, Brando was in tough guy movies before this, but The Godfather is such an enormous movie with so many different paths to take that it really elevated his status in the public eye. I've said it before but I'll say it again here. Only the very best movies can make an audience sad, smile, laugh, scared, etc. Within the confines of one story. The Godfather accomplishes all of these things. The music in this movie also fits perfectly with whatever is going on, and the theme song (I think everyone will agree) is one of the best tunes ever connected to a movie. There's many other things to discuss in detail, but if I attempted to, I'd be writing this until next year. The bottom line is The Godfather is like the Beatles of gangster films: it changed everything about the genre and basically became the yardstick by which other gangster movies are measured. It might not seem like a very fair comparison since nothing really tops this. As the decades pass, Don Corleone (whether its Vito or Michael) will continue to be seen as the very embodiment of the mafia. Coppola made sure the characters here were portrayed as sophisticated, and not like mindless criminals most people expected from a crime movie, which was a revolutionary decision. A movie this influential only comes once in a lifetime.", "Great movie": "The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.", "Truly masterly film-making, right up there with Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List": "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.) What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****", "Very Average Film. Very Overrated": "Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.", "This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.": "The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.", "A tour de force of cinema": "Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago.How to tell if a movie is good? If you can't stop thinking about it, if you keep replaying the characters' lines in your sleep, then the movie isn't just good, it's great. The Godfather's impact on the movie industry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is at least one reference to it.I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a 'perfect' movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such that though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you won't be bored for one minute. The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not portrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito and Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit for this goes to Mario Puzo's original source material but let us not forget the actors.Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but of any other actor as the family patriarch. He's so Don-like that you just wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone. But he doesn't give a single performance, he gives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesn't want anything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us Michael's transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The other actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been any other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages.", "Gangster classic": "Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.", "Solid, classy, all but perfect yet not quite great": "What happened to the sure-footed director of this film?  How did his impeccable craftsmanship ever give rise to such things as the slipshod, overwrought \"Dracula\"?SPOILERS FOLLOWIt's hard to say, but there IS that moment near the end, which some mistake for a climax or even a turning point:  Michael is in church, at the Christening ceremony of his sister's child; his henchmen are in various positions around the city (one in Nevada), poised to murder the Corleone family's most powerful enemies and rivals.  Coppola introduces a device he had hitherto studiously avoided: fast cross cutting.  \"Do you, Michael Corleone, renounce Satan?\" asks a priest.  Cut to some act of violence.  Cut back to Michael: \"I do.\"  Cut to violence.  \"And all his works?\"  Cut: Blam! Michael: \"I do.\"  Cut: another  stylishly staged shooting.  It's a wonder Francis Ford Coppola doesn't write the words \"Please note the irony\" across the screen.I don't fault the decision to use rapid, gliding montage at this point, given that it ISN'T a key moment, merely one that plays out decisions we had seen made earlier, but there's no denying that in the way it's done Coppola both hits us over the head and goes over the top (some of the killings are too operatic for what is essentially a stealth operation) - although thankfully, less far over the top than he probably planned, since the gravitational pull of his carefully made world remains strong.I must stress that this excess doesn't matter HERE.  I mention it because it's perhaps the seed of something that would grow and grow and ultimately choke later Coppola films.  Just a thought.  \"The Godfather\" itself is perfectly crafted and shaded.  There's the well realised and well photographed settings, both 1940s New York and timeless Sicily; there's the believability and depth (when The Don is shot and thought to be dead, the tears look unforced and REAL, which I doubt you could say of those in any other gangster film); there's the sense that we know these people, culturally homogenous yet not at all the same.  There's Nino Rota's wonderful score.  I don't think this is a GREAT film, in the sense that so many other people seem to think it is.  It doesn't matter.Interestingly, the morning of the day I saw \"The Godfather\" (I'd seen it before, but this was the first actual screening), someone wrote to me to protest that my harsh comments on Marlon Brando based on his performance in another film (\"Viva Zapata!\") were unfair.  What I'd said had struck me as obvious: that Brando's introspective style reveals his character far more to him than it does to us; that he acts without INTERacting, failing to mesh with the rest of the cast; that he mumbles too much.  In my reply I had to admit that I hadn't seen many Brando performances, and of the earlier ones, only Zapata.  I was almost going to admit that his performance in \"The Godfather\" was faultless.  A good thing I didn't!  When I saw it again I realised that Brando may have sufficient grip on his character not to let the film down, but just barely; again, he introspects too much, interacts too little, and mumbles.Yet the acting in \"The Godfather\" and the film overall are too strong for this to matter in the least.", "Never Fails": "I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best.", "Cinema at its best": "I think people here have said pretty much all that needs to be said about this film. Just watch it if you haven't done so already, this is pure quality regarding plot, acting, music, everything.", "Incredible Film-making": "The story of a Mafia family it's about honor and loyalty but it's also a story of crime, it both espouses and perverts the American dream. The film has so many iconic scenes that stand out in the memory, even when years pass between viewings. The film was based upon the best selling novel by Mario Puzo.The film has an amazing cast who bring to life memorable and well rounded characters to earn our sympathy, despite some of the deeds they perpetrate. While Marlon Brando would receive the accolades and the Academy Award, we also have Oscar nominated performances from James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino. Also of note is John Cazale (he appeared in only 6 films before his untimely death, all of them were nominated for Best Picture). Not to be forgotten are; Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire. The cast between them have thus far won 5 Oscars wins and been nominated for another 22.We have the incredible score of Nino Rota remains one of the most evocative scores in film, and it is a tribute to the composer and the film that just a few notes can conjure such images almost 50 years later.We also have the wonderful cinematography of Gordon Willis who created such powerful images, at times very warm while at other times so very dark.There's no doubt that the film does paint a somewhat romanticized portrait of a mafia family but it's not just a film about crime it's about family. The film was followed up shortly by a very good sequel (Godfather II) that maintained the high standards of its predecessor even to the extent of achieving the Academy Award for Best Picture, but for me it wasn't quite as compelling. These films were followed by a less memorable sequel (Godfather III) 16 years later that while earning 7 Oscar nominations itself, mostly served as a reminder of how much less powerful it was than its predecessors.", "I don't get the hype.": "I watched this recently because of all the hype. Maybe it is because of the hype I thought it was average or maybe it's just an average film.It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?Worth a watch but don't get too excited.", "\"Perfection...\"": "The Godfather (1972)Number 1 - 1972Number 1 - 1970sTop 5 - All TimeAn offer you can't refuse ...The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances everFrancis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:'The best gangster film since The Godfather'Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them. Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.-10/10-", "History is made with this movie": "I cannot think of a single negative of the Godfather. It truly is a classic and will always be one of the greatest films ever made. I have seen it many times and recently purchased the movie so that I could watch it anytime that I want. I love the score for this film and get goosebumps when I hear that opening trumpet begin to play. As the movie progresses I begin to feel a connection to the characters and become invested in their growth and story. As many times as I have seen this movie, I continue to have the same feelings. It is one of the movies that can never get old and will always be a masterpiece. It will be a number of years before anything can come close to the magnitude of this film and it may never be contested.", "What?": "How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.", "A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity": "Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.", "IT'S JUST TOO LONG": "\"The Godfather\" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)", "Epic Gangster Movie!!!": "\"The Godfather\" is a superb movie it is all about a Gangster family and their crimes fights story business and all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.The Direction done by \"Francis D Coppola\" is great and the acting done by \"Al Pacino\" and others were 100% Top notch.I watched this movie recently about a year ago and I had no words describe this MASTERPIECE at that time!!!Overall the movie was must watch and Top notch entertainment. It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!", "A novel of images": "Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.\"The Godfather\" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that \"Godfather\" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in \"Part Two\", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).\"The Godfather\" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.\"The Godfather, Part Two\" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established \"Don\" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.\"The Godfather, Part Three\" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.", "Can't believe there are non believers off this film out there.": "I was searching through the reviews of this film and came across a couple that weren't particularly complimentary about the film. Firstly I have to say that this film is not my favourite film of all time, but is definitely in my top 3. Secondly, one person seemed to take offence of Marlon Brando's performance, that in itself is an insult as Brando was incredible in this film. Coppola's direction and attention to detail are inch perfect for me. The whole cast was brilliant in particular Al Pacino who gives an Oscar worthy performance of epic proportions. You don't just watch this film for me, you experience a whole new chapter of life that most would never experience through this film. The word epic can be overused in terms of film but this is 100% an epic of epic proportions. I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion but get with it man, you don't get films better than this and I refuse to believe that people who have rated the likes of 'Django unchained' as close in terms of quality to this film should be allowed to comment on film in general. 10/10!!!", "America's Masterpiece": "Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\" \"It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\" \"In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.\" \"I believe in America.\" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it.", "A True Masterpiece": "I watched The Godfather for the first time on DVD the other day and was simply blown away from the very start. It had a quality that no other film has and much of this is accomplished by the brilliance of the director, Francis Ford Coppola, and actors Marlon Brando and the astonishing performance of Al Pacino, who many doubted at the time. All great films require a great beginning and this one had, in my opinion, the best yet with the very first line, 'I believe in America', and then the very slow draw back of the camera to reveal The Godfather (Brando). I was worried for Al Pacino at the start of the film whether he would be shadowed out of this movie by the brilliance of Brando, but all doubt quickly went from my mind after watching him in the restaurant scene. The way that he sat there so calmly to the people he was talking to but to the audience he built up an incredible amount of tension. This was important for him to do this because this part of the film was the defining moment of this characters transition, from not wanting to be involved at the start and now he is doing his fathers job personally.", "Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.": "I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.", "The best!": "I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a \"movie night\" for myself.  Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time.  Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character.  Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect.  After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3.  Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!", "WTF?!": "Anything below a 9+ is automatic removal of your rating privileges. This is it, Masterpiece, the GOAT, THIS IS MOVIE, THIS IS CINEMA PERIOD!!", "Showy and shallow": "Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the \"Gone with the Wind\" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.", "Almost Perfect": "This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie.", "Never understood the hype": "The Godfather is considered a \"classic\" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about \"important\" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.", "Absurdly overrated": "I'm sure it was good for its time, but by todays standard this is truly mediocre. It's 3 hours of boredom, cheesy stereotypical dialog, and unrealistic mafia. Some of the sub plots, like the 30 minute Sicilia sequence, with Michael marrying this girl we have never seen before, only for the movie to kill her off 20 minutes later, before we've even heard her talk? One of the most useless sub plots I have ever seen in any movie. Did they expect us to care for her after introducing her 20 minutes ago, and not even giving her a proper line to say? Movie should have well under 2 hours and at the end of the day was a borefest.", "MAJOR difference in opinion...": "I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as \"#1\" on the IMDb.   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s.  So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition.  There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the \"offer you can't refuse\" line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan's Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make. For those who say \"oh, you just didn't get it, see it again\", please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you're conditioned to like. The Emperor's New Clothes, big time. End of review.", "A True Classic": "Hands down, The Godfather is the best picture ever made, in my opinion. The Godfather II is also a great film, and so is Citizen Kane. Hollywood, in its heyday, made some incredibly classic films, which makes it rather difficult to choose which ones are best. I have chosen The Godfather. Have watched it many times, and it never fails to keep me interested and entertained.", "Let's Get Down To The Facts": "OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for \"Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that \"Cabaret\" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, \"The Godfather\" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.", "Great movies are not born great, they are made great.": "I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, \"Is it The Godfather level good or not ?\".This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion. All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of \"Bravo!\". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.", "The Godfather is so good that real life gangsters patterned themselves after the movie": "It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film.  Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen.", "Would Watch Once": "G: i personally would say 8 out of 10 but the movie does drag on which is why i have to rate it a bit lower\nC: Heard too much about movie so expectations were set too high, disappointed seemed over-hyped. 7 out of 10.", "One of the Best Movies Ever Made": "This film has an amazing everything. Amazing acting. Amazing plot. Amazing characters. Amazing writing. This movie I could re watch hundreds of times and it would never get old. It's too good!", "Excellent": "It is one the best film i have watched. And this is very little that i can add to the review on here that have explained what is so wonderful about the godfather so well.", "Marlon Brando at his best!": "Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of clich\u00e9 to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it. But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.", "Mafia Classic": "I grew up watching this movie and it's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is a gangster classic that every film buff should watch.The great performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan other veteran actors are outstanding in this culture-changing epic. A Sicilian wedding, gun and cannolis, fishes in a vest, a horse head, a corrupt cop, the Don's demise - there are so many events in this movie that you will never get bored of it. I know I never do.I definitely suggest it.", "The definitive mob movie": "Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.", "Definitely not a masterpece": "I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion.\nThe acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition.\nBut then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a \"part two\", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive...\nAgain, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.", "List of things which are more entertaining than watching \"The Godfather\"": "1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let\u00b4s say, a million miles.You get the idea, don\u00b4t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called \"classics\" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler\u00b4s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can\u00b4t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.", "An overrated classic.": "Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable.", "Its good but Geez....": "I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored.  At the same time I was seeing things like \"Scarecrow\" and \"Deliverance\" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense. \nI've seen it again recently, twice.  I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good.  But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.  Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice.  He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk.  James Caan is miscast.  Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing.  Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.", "And so it begins": "The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show \"Sopranos\". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the \"family\" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)", "Massively overrated": "I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called \"legendary\" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics\u0085 But the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole \"family\" tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to \"care\" about these characters, to think that they are \"cool\". The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care. The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a \"hallmark\" of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and \"culturally relevant\". Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch \"Donnie Brasco\" instead.", "The Best Movie Ever Made? I Think Not.": "With a movie as critically acclaimed as The Godfather, you'd think it was the best movie of all time. Sadly, for me, this was not the case. It was a decent movie, of course; but, in the end, it had a few major flaws.First and foremost is a flaw that many may see as a great asset (thus pointing out the obviously subjective nature of movie watching): its length. Now, I have nothing against long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on. I've seen many people who made this complaint get called people with low attention spans and low intelligence; this is complete idiocy. The movie had, for all its apparent greatness, many superfluous scenes (the parts of the movie that took place in Sicily seemed particularly long and drawn out). It truly did not know when to end, and thus did not keep my interest.Another flaw was the the pompousness of the film. It truly seemed to me that every person involved was completely full of themselves and the movie they were making. It just bugged the crud out of me.Another flaw was the underdevelopment of many of the other crime bosses in the film, all of which are of course killed by Michael's men. I didn't even know any of their names, and this alone should show you how little I could care about them. A great movie makes you care about even the villains, so that their deaths are affecting.There's more I could say, but I have limited space here, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was decent, but far from the greatest movie ever made. In fact, it is probably the most highly overrated movie of all time.", "It never gets old!": "This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.When we can't pick a movie to watch, me and my friends just instinctively settle for \"The Godfather\". We know each and every dialogue and we love saying the dialogues verbatim! Besides, what other movie has so many great actors doing their best work? Where else will you find someone beating Al Pacino at acting then in this movie? This movie just never gets old for me and my friends. And that is why it deserves a 10 star vote!", "The greatest film of all time.": "Francis Ford Coppola made his breakthrough directorial effort with 1972's Best Picture (according to AMPAS and numerous circles) is unquestionably the greatest american film.  This isn't to say that Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane aren't as good as it.  In fact, Apocalypse Now (also directed by Coppola) is probably better in terms of visual style and cause, but Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel THE GODFATHER) and Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay is surpisingly cohesive, and Gordon Willis' stunning photography accentuates the period feel of the film.  It is like no other work of cinema to come out of the 70s and will never be topped.  Not even by Coppola.  The story is so reminiscent of Shakespeare and Greek tragedies that Corleone seems almost mythological.  All in all this is a film about finding the American dream.  It's a film about honor, respect and tradition.  The word mafia is never used because unlike GoodFellas and Casino, this is not an expose or biography of the mafia, but is an epic story of an American family.  The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be.", "Not great, merely very well made": "The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.", "The Godawfulfather": "This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this \"movie\". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this \"i'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10.", "Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?": "Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: \"Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car\" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.", "Masterpiece": "A masterpiece. The best crime film of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are magnetic, and the supporting cast brings the thunder as well.", "The most overrated movie of all time.": "Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.\nI saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either.", "When did overacting become art?": "I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron.", "An Offer You Cant Refuse": "The Godfather has influenced every gangster film that has been made since. In terms of mannerisms, quotes, story line and characters.Vito Corleone is also known as Don Corleone, who is the head of the Corleone Crime family, who are one of the five crime families in the Italian Mafia that rule America. Don Corleone meets a drug dealer named Sollazzo who wants to make a deal involving narcotics, the Don who has old fashioned value see's this as a threat and rejects the offer only to be gunned down. The Corleone kids, Sonny, Tom, Michael and Fredo must unite to hold their family and organisation together. And for Michael the youngest, things will never be the same again.The Godfather is a masterpiece. There are endless scenes in the movie that strike a strong and powerful cord with the audience. From the first scene which shows Don Corleone sort out a problem to the violent death of his son and the rise of Michael.Although made in 1972, still connects with people today. Its a different type of family movie like someone previously reviewed. It holds a strong sense of loyalty and what one will do if they are pushed beyond their limits. The cast is perfect; Marlon Brando is amazing as the ageing Don, while James Caan plays the hot headed Sonny perfectly and Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall give a great performance. But it is Al Pacino who shines. He portrays the innocent young man who vows to never be like his family only to plunge himself into darkness in order to protect his beloved family.A masterpiece. A masterpiece that has effected the world when it comes to gangster movies.", "a great work for art": "A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble.\nA big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)", "Massively overrated.": "I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as \"The Greatest Movie of All Time\".  I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time. Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so \"beloved\" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.", "Great film making in a moral vacuum.": "A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery. We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate?  The bricks and mortar of the  Long Island mansion that we see before us.The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a \"sit down\"? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection  of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity \"that corporations cannot provide.\"Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced \"college boy\".The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...", "I remember when I saw this film for the first time...": "This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.", "The Godfather (1972)": "The Godfather is a great movie that innovated the crime genre. It has a great story which (for a nearly 3 hour movie) moves quickly. We are brought close to the professional and personal lives of these mafia men, and when we see some of them gunned down, it's relatively hard-hitting. This was an innovation at the time: for a mafia film to bring us emotionally close to the characters. Perhaps the most shocking scene in the film (not to spoil anything) ends with a car riddled in machine gun bullets. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone can be seen as one of the most iconic performances/roles in film history: it is Brando transformed, and he's fun to quote back to. Like any movie that is labeled with such a \"legendary\" status, The Godfather is a tad overrated; but still very good nonetheless thanks to it's great story, performances, and iconic scenes.", "Couldn't get any better than this...": "I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker \"movies\" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!", "Bait and Switch is the Name of this Game": "Does \"Godfather\" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name \"Corleone\" which translates as \"Lionhearted,\" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? \"Godfather\" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. \"Godfather\" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called \"bait and switch.\" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp \u0096 even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.) This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of \"Godfather\" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name \"Lionheart.\"", "I just don't get it": "I finally watched this movie, and I just don't get the hype. I didn't dislike it, and the violence didn't bother me, but I found it over-long and very, very slow. I'm a 50-something who doesn't demand a break-neck pace in a film, even an \"action\" film\u0085 I'm used to watching long movies that take some time to unfold, and I don't mind that. I have patience. But \"The Godfather\" just seemed to be moving at the wrong pace for its subject matter. I never got into it. I finished it, but I didn't feel drawn into their world.Not helping was the fact that of course by now everyone, even those who haven't seen the film, knows about all the catch-phrases and classic scenes, so they seem like jokes (although naturally that wouldn't have been a problem when the film was newly-released). Brando almost seemed to be a caricature of himself in the early scenes\u0085 although he got a little better, a little less heavy-handed, after the Don came home from the hospital. In that first sequence in his office during the wedding, I could hardly understand a word he was saying. How could anyone take a man who spoke that way seriously? But again, I was watching it after many years of encountering deliberately bad Brando imitations, so I was at a disadvantage in that respect.That wedding\u0085 good lord, it lasted longer than many marriages do! I thought it was never going to be over. But while I was watching it, I recalled that I had in fact tried to watch this movie about 30 years ago, when my brother was really into it. I didn't even make it through the wedding. I remember my brother fast-forwarding the VHS tape to show me Abe Vigoda when he became convinced I wasn't going to sit and watch the whole thing with him\u0085 one quick look at Abe Vigoda and I was outta there. This time I also noticed one of my favorite character actors, Vito Scotti, in the wedding sequence.The people who did \"General Hospital\" in the 1990's must have loved this film. They even lifted the mobster's-chick-gets-blown-up-in-car idea for recycling on the soap opera.I watched the DVD over two nights. The local public library gives me 7, and for a while there I thought I was gonna need 'em all. A good illustration of my feelings for the tension and pacing of the film are that after Sonny bought it at the tollbooth, I turned it off for the night and went to bed, since that was as good a place as any to break. Just didn't care, one way or the other, what was going to happen next. One less character to keep track of. Plenty more where he came from. I was just hoping Vito Scotti would come back.I won't give it a 1 as others have in a deliberate attempt to bring down its average\u0085 I'll give it an honest rating that I really feel it deserves. The fact that I don't understand why so many people are so crazy about this film doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right and they're wrong\u0085 in fact, it might well be the opposite. But I stand by the title of this review: I just don't get it.", "You'll Probably Only Watch It Once - But you'll never forget it": "This is, no doubt, an iconic movie/series and I have seen it reference multiple times in other movies and shows. ( You've Got Mail - Tom Hanks and horse head scene, Serendipity, Everybody Loves Raymond, and even in the animated movie Zootopia and so on and so on) But after watching all 3 Parts over the course of 3 consecutive nights I can assure you, as I have also read from others, I won't be watching this again.The series follows the lives of Vito Corleone and his son Michael in a blood dripping, gut wrenching drama that spans nearly 9 hours (Credits not included). It unfolds in a series of events centered around the power, manipulation, and revenge of the mafia. And by the end you can't help but feel like this is a modern day Hamlet - \"Everyone dies\".I read comments about how the acting was bad, the accents were a joke, and this series, even more specifically, part I is overrated. And while I don't fully share in that \"sentiment\" and I certainly won't forget this movie, I simply couldn't watch it again. The drama, the drawn out events, the moments of intensity and suspenseful thrill isn't something I'd really care to experience again in this facet.But the main theme that I took from this is, simply, \"revenge reaps more revenge\". And to see old Michael Corleone sit in his chair as he dies, naturally, in Part III wasn't all that satisfying after seeing what preceded the course of his life and that of his fathers'. Bearing in mind that anything in relation to the mafia isn't supposed to have a fairytale ending, so it's not as though my expectations were that of the contrary - it's just not my preference.In my opinion the acting WAS good, I didn't feel like the accents were bad at all, and if I were to imagine, the plot probably followed quite closely to how things would go in real life. Which is simply another reason why I just wouldn't want to watch it again.As I am very much of an Italian, myself, I can have an appreciation for various parts of the movie(s) - the scenes from Italy, the family life, the head of the household and all that follows. And although I wouldn't necessarily discourage anyone from watching it, I could certainly understand if they were to only watch it once.In case the R rating didn't give any indication to the type of movie that this is there is definitely a lot of graphic violence, quite a bit of foul language (even more as you continue you into Part II and especially Part III), and even partial nudity in part I - this should clearly go without saying but, Obviously, not a movie I'd watch with any kids around.I will give you a fair warning that throughout all 3 parts there will be moments of confusion for you filled with questions but all will be set straight when the credits roll.", "Interesting but hardly great.": "Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.Hardly something worthy of praise. The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.", "Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made.": "Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.\nHowever, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able. Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one. The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end.", "unique": "I saw it very late. the fame was one of basic motives. the theme - the second cause. for many friends, to see it was an experience. and it is an experience. without can say why. because , in a film about Mafia , for a special public, at first sigh, all is perfect. so perfect than, scene by scene, it becomes more than a masterpiece. great actors. special performances. memorable scenes. dialogues and situations and a cold feeling. a film about values. and near every day reality. and choices, errors and mistakes. who, after decades, remains fresh in memory. as an unique meet.", "Classic crime": "The movie is very old.

Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia.  Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia.  James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens.  A big accident.  Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director.  He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here.  the acting was wonderful from everybody.

What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film 'elites' love so much.It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story?  Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system.", "just perfect": "What can I say about \"the godfather\" that has not been said before? That it is a masterpiece? That its staff is just wonderful? That the actors and soundtrack are superb? That it is considered one of the best films ever?

I had never the opportunity of watching to it in original version and, when I did it, I could perfectly realize the fabulous wonder I was able to enjoy, Marlon Brando is just impressive, Al Pacino is as good as him, and James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton deserved to be congratulated. Thanks to Coppola, for giving us the pleasure of watching \"the Godfather\"", "An Excellent Movie": "Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States \"Don Vito Corleone\" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter \"Connie Corleone\" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son \"Michael Corleone\" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers \"Sonny Corleone\" (James Caan), \"Fredo Corleone\" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother \"Tom Hagen\" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort.", "Coppola's masterpiece about Italian gangsters in the 1940s with Brando, Pacino, Caan & Duvall": "RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, \"The Godfather\" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the \"hysterical\" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, \"The Godfather\" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's \"Bullitt\"); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent \"love at first sight\" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.GRADE: A", "Great movie, but not really that great": "I wasn't born when the movie came out, but grew up hearing how the older generations praise the film to be the greatest film ever made. And I agreed, it was deep, it was majestic. But it wasn't really as legendary as you'd expect, especially when we compare it with the movies we see nowadays. However, the movie was made in 1972 and there probably wasn't much choice back then.", "A tale of personal business": "Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.", "The Greatest gangster film EVER!!!!!!!": "Well what can i say? A great cast, a great director and a great film. This surely has to be one of my all time greats, beautifully acted and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in a sense that its almost ubelievable to believe that a director could achieve this. The cast line up includes Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and Diana Keaton. Marlon Brando gives an extraordinary performance as Don Voto Corleone aka the Godfather. With its breath taking story line and emotional story telling and a stellar cast.What more can you ask for this emotionally gritty drama. And the answer is nothing, because this is to as near perfect film making you are going to see. Don't MISS ME", "Best Crime Movies Ever": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972.", "A truly impressive film": "I had to watch the entire trilogy and reflect on the films for a while before I realized what a great film \"The Godfather\" is. As I watched all three films, I really got familiar with all of the characters and became more intrigued as the series went on. Looking back, I felt that this first film was the greatest of the trilogy for several reasons. First of all, it has Marlon Brando, who portrays the amazing character Vito Corleone. This is one of the most memorable, imitated, and lovable characters in film history. His character is masterfully balanced as a powerful mafia patriarch and a loving family man. For this he won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar. I also prefer this film because Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is a hero rather than the villain he later becomes. As Vito Corelone is wounded by an enemy, Michael must take over leading his empire while he is recovering. The interactions between the characters is excellent here, as is the film's dialogue. There is also a great supporting cast, consisting of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and more. What a well-crafted story. Part II is almost as good, but I think this is slightly better. Close to perfect.***1/2 out of ****", "Watched once": "I watched it once (in jail) to see what all the fuss is about. Boring. I would not watch it again. Its appeal confuses me and I like most popular movies.", "Best gangsters movie ever.": "This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the \"godfather\" Don Vito Corleone. Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's \"five families\". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an \"offer we cannot refuse\": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century. Those who love good cinema must see this film.", "Overrated": "I watched this movie, trying not to set my hopes too high, after everything i had heard about THE GODFATHER. I think its overrated. It's an OK story. But i do not think that this movie should be worshiped the way it is. I think most people say its the greatest movie of all times, Because someone said to those people that it was the greatest movie of all time. I on the other hand found it so boring. So completely overrated and just simply SO boring that i hope never to see the other episodes of this movie. I in fact pray my children in the future will never have to see such a bad movie. Im sorry to say these thing and sound like a hater. But i really just do not agree with you and other who find this movie so magnificent. But i found this movie very bad apart from ill make him an offer he cant refuse story. Other than that i found this movie a mistake.", "Completely un-redeeming in any way. Garbage.": "I remember distinctly the first time I saw \"The Godfather\". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted \"The Godfather\" as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a \"good movie\" when I saw one.Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed \"The Godfather\" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that \"The Godfather\" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.I find it interesting that many of those who claim \"The Godfather\" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the \"fans\" I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD \"Godfather\" collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the \"greatest film of all time\".I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. \"The Godfather\" is a paper tiger.", "Not easy to seize power in the mafia": "The USA have reached a point of no return in 1972 that is going to lead them to their final defeat in Vietnam and their tremendous decline in the world. At this moment too the consumer's society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrow-mindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass consumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The mafia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this \u00ab cancer \u00bb contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather's death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the mafia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian mafia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women. Francis Ford Coppola takes a very visible pleasure in this depiction that he complacently shows in its very minute details of cruelty and viciousness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne", "Doors, windows, mirrors": "In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later.", "Just what everyone needs: another 10/10 review of The Godfather": "The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the \"my opinion\" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I \"appreciate\" whilst not particularly \"enjoying.\"But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene...... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I \"had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled\"... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing.We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly.Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course).Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside).If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too.Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime.", "The greatest movie EVER MADE": "This is the greatest movie ever made, I'm not joking. I have watched a lot of movies, movies with more oscars and not a single one is better than this. The story, the casting, even the soundtrack is perfect.", "A study in social pathology": "A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from \"enemies\" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed \"enemies\"; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star.", "So freaking good": "Honestly, I didn't thought that a movie can live up to the praise like this movie. I watch it like a year ago, and it is what everyone says - unbelievable amazing and unique. Just a masterpiece. No other way to describe", "Classic in Crime and Cinema in General": "This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me.This movie is based on the novel that was written by Mario Puzo. We are following the Corleone family with the changing of the guard. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) runs the business with his son Sonny (James Caan), lawyer/adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and crew. Michael (Pacino) is home from the war where he was a hero. We see how he gets mixed up with a life he never wanted and becoming the new don.There's not a lot I can say that is new here. This is a classic. The performances are amazing. Francis Ford Coppola was a master in filmmaking with what he did. This movie is just captivating. Jaime doesn't like long movies and she struggled with breaking from it. This is even an older movie and even set in the 1940s into the 50s. That didn't bother her. It feels authentic and seeing how ruthless these people are while keeping their honor is on another level. This is one of the greatest movies of all time for a reason.My Rating: 10 out of 10.", "A Behemoth of Modern Cinema, Still Potent After Fifty Years": "The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc.It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance of a great novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work.Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppetmaster married to the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling.", "A truly story driven plot line": "This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of \"fluff\" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly \"angry\" or \"troubled\" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making.", "Tedious beyond belief": "I have attempted to get through this film on 4 separate occasions. All I hear are good things and how it's the best of the best. However, I can't get through it. There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don't care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don't see it.", "a strange choice for best movie (but sure beats LOTR)": "Hollywood has some strange politics.  Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops.  Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves.  And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow).  Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to \"The Godfather\" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs.  I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power.  I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of \"bestest picture ever.\"I actually think \"The Godfather: Part II\" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the \"human\" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here.  And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with \"Star Wars,\" mistakenly remembering Yoda and \"Luke, I am your father\" as elements from the \"classic\" first film).  Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.I prefer \"Donnie Brasco\" because the character development is richer, and even \"A Bronx Tale\" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world).  But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day.", "Stylish classic a head of its time": "A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full.", "A beautiful film": "I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife \"Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?\" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just \"business\". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like \"I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker\" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse.", "Simply A Masterpiece": "\"The Godfather is a truly Godfather of all mob movie i've ever watch, fills with powerful and outstanding perfomance by all the cast, again added with Marlon Brando oscar winning perfomance that really proofing the reason why The Godfather was a Masterpiece\"", "Overrated, but still good": "I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.", "Quite Amazing What Coppola Pulled Off": "The Godfather (1972) **** (out of 4) Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece adapted from Mario Puzo's novel about crime lord Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his attempt to keep his family from going in the wrong direction. Everything imaginable has already been said about this movie so there's not too many reasons to go back through it. Having recently watched the movie theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly. People know about the studio not wanting Brando and Al Pacino but can you imagine what would have happened had neither one been here? I've never felt this was anywhere near Brando's greatest performance and in fact I might not even place it in the top ten. That's not saying anything against his work here but it speaks for how great he was. I think the most impressive thing was seeing how well he could play someone elderly. Just think that he followed this up with LAST TANGO IN Paris and it just shows what all he could do. With Pacino it has been said that the studio didn't like the rushes they were seeing involving some of his early stuff like at the wedding. Watching these scenes it's easy to see why they'd be nervous but just check out the sequence when his character takes on the responsibility of going to the restaurant. It's really like Pacino the legend is born in this scene and that brilliant scene is like us seeing what was to follow in his career. Not only is there Brando and Pacino but also Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Abe Vigoda turning in masterful performances. Another thing that really sticks out is how brave Coppola was for letting the story takes its time. There are many, many slow moments here where we get dialogue scenes that get dragged out. Everyone mentions the wedding sequence but this is a perfect example of where the slowness is such a benefit as it really gets you on the inside of understanding how this family works. Coppola allowing the film to takes its time was a dangerous move but it really pays off because there's not another film like this. A lot of future movies tried to copy the style and this certainly slow, building drama but none of them were as successful. Nino Rota's music is simply irresistible and the opening cords as the movie opens are just chilling. The cinematography is some of the most amazing you're ever going to see and the lighting here is among the greatest ever. Especially effective are the scenes inside the Don's office and how the light was used. THE GODFATHER isn't going to get my vote as the greatest movie of all time, of the decade or even the greatest gangster picture. With that said, there's no question that this is still a essential part of American film history and with so much talent involved it's just amazing to watch it today and admire what all they were able to accomplish.", "The Finest American Cinema Has To Offer": "It has been said so many times that it seems clich\u00e9, but I wil continue to say it. The Godfather is one of he greatest movies ever made. Words cannot express how well the film combines all the elements a film needs, to be good. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life.The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie. At the wedding reception we are introduced to the many of the members of the Corleone crime family, however not all of them are part of the \"family business\". At the wedding, Vito's youngest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not like his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael Corleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. It's an excellent example of how character growth should be done.From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked for favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his transformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema.", "The definitive masterpiece": "I won't say much about this. This is perfect at every level.\nThe story, epic.\nThe acting and dialogue, memorables.\nThe pace, irreproachable.\nThe editing, precise.\nThe score, iconic.\nFrancis Lord Coppola creating the definitive master piece. The master piece of master pieces, executing everything as perfectly as it ever something was excecuted.", "Not just a guy film.... maybe": "What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said?  The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling.  I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film. \nThe Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it.  However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C)  It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater. Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime.  If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.  --Shel", "THE family film": "Based on the Mario Puzo book, the Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, tells the story of Vito Corleone, Don Vito Corleone, or more accurately, the Godfather. His vision is to transfer power of the organisation to an understudy - ideally his son. With any luck, the organisation can transcend the crime background it was born from and become self-sufficient as a legitimate business.Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia crime organisation in New York; he's both respected and feared. Times though are changing; other crime families want a piece of the action - the only way to do that is to remove Don Corleone. Don Corleone, despite the fear he brings to people, he's shown to be a family man - always looking out for his immediate and extended family. We get to see a fabulous juxtaposition as he's both celebrating the marriage of his only daughter, but in the background he's finalising important family business. After concluding the celebration it's back to normal, Corleone assumes that everything is moving forward with no issues and he'll soon be out of the hot-seat. When he barely just escapes an assassination attempt it's up to his family to look after him, the organisation, the family, and themselves if possible.The Corleone sons try their best to be there in the hour of need. James Caan plays Sunny, hot headed and determined to make sure the family is respected, even if that means looking for a fight. John Cazale plays middle child Freddo, who enjoys more of a hedonistic lifestyle than he does a life of aggressive crime - more a lover than a fighter it's always assumed that Freddo wouldn't be a success as the family head. Robert Duvall plays Tom Hagan, who, although not family by blood, he's the adopted child who plays a vital role of advisor and lawyer to the family. Then there is Michael, played by Al Pacino, the black sheep of the family - never doing what is expected and living by his own rules. When he was expected to stay at home - he leaves for an education, when a scholarship could be paid for - he's off to fight in WWII, when he's expected to find a nice Italian wife - he brings an American home to visit the parents. It seems he's always doing the opposite of what is expected and he's the son that's always at loggerheads with his dad as attempts to find his own place in the world. With the family in turmoil, young Michael does what nobody expects, and makes a stand. All the time he's adamant that the stand he's making is short term and he has no plans to follow in his father's footsteps.This is an amazing film - which isn't just my own opinion, heck, just look at film review and polls over the years and this film usually finds its way into top five lists. It's beautifully written by Puzo (I've read all his Godfather books) and the film sticks extremely close to the source material. Coppola does a fantastic job directing it, focussing on even the tiniest details, for example; camera heights to portray perception in scenes, small mannerisms that he's asked actors to show shots that compare and contrast people in the same shot. There are brilliant performances from everybody on and off screen - the score and photography is just as strong as the actor's performances - which is top class.Although the film is crime and mafia themed, it's just as easy to think of this as a social film, looking at interactions and relationships, character developments and family life. It's a haunting and powerful depiction of a family caught in the middle of conflict and upheaval - it's a film that stayed with me from the first time I watched it and still gives me goose-bumps when I re-watch it 20-30 years later. This absolutely gets a 10 out of 10 from me.", "The Beginning of a Star....Al Pacino": "There is not a lot that can be said about the Godfather that has not already been said so i wont bother to give a description of what this masterpiece is about but i will mention a few thing about the acting. It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10.", "Brando in the most charismatic performance of all time": "The movie has it all, and everything is handled to perfection.The plot is so intriguing, one never gets bored.The performances are top notch, especially Marlon Brando(the MOST CHARISMATIC PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME), Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan.HIGHLY recommended for anyone who has missed the best movie ever made.", "Saga of the Dark American Dream": "The three GODFATHER movies are an interesting, detailed look into the dark side of the American Dream. It is no accident that the first film begins with the words, \"I believe in America.\"We are taken along on Michael's journey as he goes from naive idealism to corruption, then struggles to free himself from crime, only to be pulled back into it. This is a classic American theme of initiation into evil. One cannot touch evil without being touched by evil.The cast is first-rate, and the story has become so much a part of Americana now that some of the dialogue has even become recognizable catch-phrases. Even the theme music is instantly recognizable.Watch the trilogy and see the essential American saga.", "Most overrated film of all-time": "This movie continues to be praised, but when I rented it I only made it through 45 minutes before I stopped the video.  There aren't many movies that are so bad I don't watch the whole thing, but \"The Godfather\" is that bad.  I don't care how much other people may like it.  I still say it sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks...", "What is so great about it?": "This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named \"The Best Movie of All Time.\"", "Modern Gangster Classic": "The Godfather(1972) helped resurrect a low budget genre known as the gangster genre and turned it into a major film genre for the next two decades.  Many people found a new way in speaking to each other by watching this film.  In fact many members of organized crime in the USA began to pattern themselves right after the characters in the film.  The gangster genre would become one of the most popular genres to come out of Hollywood since the end of Film Noir in 1958.\nThe film deals more with the joys and sorrows of an mafia family then with what they do for a living.  You can identify with many characters from the film because many people also go through almost similar problems in life. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo contribute to give some excellent story telling visually.  Marlon Brando gives a very good performance as the head of the family, Vito Corleone.\nThere are many memorable moments in this film.  One, the Wedding scene at the beginning of the movie.  Two, the Sollozzo-McCluskey murder sequence. Finally, the death of Vito Corleone.\nThe Godfather's success would spawn many classic gangster flicks including Mean Streets(1973), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Once Upon a Time in America(1984), Goodfellas(1990), and Donnie Brasco(1997).  Also influences filmmakers ranging from Martin Scorsese to Abel Ferrara and John Woo to Takeshi Kitano.  Sergio Leone was at one point offered to direct The Godfather(1972) but turned it down.  I believe that The Godfather(1972) would be just as good if in the hands of a genius like Sergio Leone.\nAl Pacino gives a terrific performance as the youngest son, Michael.  James Caan gives the best performance of the film despite his role as a supporting actor.  Frank Sinatara was considered for the role of Johnny the singer but didn't get it because the role was too close to home for the famed singer. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the lawyer for the Corleone family, Tom Hagan", "One of the best films ever made -- beautiful & poetic": "This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.5/5. Beautiful. A must watch.", "Why all the fuss": "Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?", "It is a movie \"you can't refuse\"!": "Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.What makes Al Pacino's role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer's strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I'd suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.And may I also add in the end that the second part \"Godfather 2\" is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come.", "Art in the form of a motion picture": "Clearly a film masterpiece in every sense of the word.

We see the struggle of one family trying to run the business in a world where rival families will do anything to muscle them out of the way.  Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business.  Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding?  Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III.  Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all.  I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time.", "This is a masterpiece of epic proportions": "The 70s is my favourite decade of films, a new breed of cinema began and it started with The Godfather and ended with Apocalypse Now, both directed by the master, Coppolla!!! In-between, we had many films, ranging from innovative thrillers to a stunning comic book picture(Superman), from horrors to romance etc etc.Guys and gals, the 1970s was and always will be the decade when cinema had taken a massive change. Don't get me wrong, I love the 40s, 50s, 60s, 80s and 90s, but the decade in question just took a bigger step.The Godfather is storytelling at its finest, it just can't get any better (actually it does in Godfather part2), this film is stunning, amazing, breathtaking and near-perfection.The performances are stunning, every person in the picture is amazing, they really drew me into their world. Marlon Brando is amazing, no one could've made this role work. On paper, Brando's role is simple but the execution could only be done by Marlon.The masterful story-telling crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla hit the right notes. Francis directs each scene with stunning authority. The production values are breathtaking, very authentic. Every person on the film deserves a hand. And let's not forget the unforgettable score by Nina Rota.I won't tell you about the story because only the film can do it justice. Just watch it. Always worth watching every year, a film which will take multiple viewings to understand all characters.The saga continues in The Godfather part 2.This is A MASTERPIECE!", "Would you like an orange?": "Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. \"I believe in America.\" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc. There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an \"eye-level\" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.The famous \"Mattress Sequence\" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.It's quite fascinating to recognize how many \"classic\" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse.", "One of the greatest movie of all time": "*December 2014:The classic , perfect movie that I've ever seen , the best film of all time just behind Shawshank Redemption .

It's ridiculous that a 42 year old movie still bests ANY current movie. \"The Godfather\" is simply TOO perfect. The acting. The dialogue, the action, the overall story. People expecting video game action, pleas look elsewhere or go to bed. \"The Godfather\" is simply one of cinema's greatest achievements!", "Near Perfect": "Not a lot can be said about this classic that hasn't already been written in hundreds of reviews on this website and across the world in the decades since its release. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall are all amazing here. The script and the pacing are perfect. It's really a great story about the shedding of ideals in favor of supporting the corrupt criminal gang that is Michael Corleone's (Pacino) family. So many classic quotes and movie scenes. This is one of the all time greats.", "Cinema, what has become epochal": "\"The Godfather\" - 3 Oscars, including for the Best film, the cast, which became legendary, the images imitated by followers. This film marked an entire era of gangster cinema fashion.Francis Ford Coppola's film lasts almost 3 hours. Yes, it is long, in places it seems that it is drawn out, but this is due to the fact that the film was released more than 45 years ago. Then it was not fashionable and necessary to show constant action on the screen, the scenes were long. However, this, in my opinion, helped to show the life of the main characters more detailed, to feel their characters, to better understand their motivation.There are two key figures in the film. And they are played by iconic actors. Marlon Brando masterfully tries on the mantle of the main mafia, who enjoys indisputable authority. This is felt in every frame, in every scene where there is a hero Don Vito Corleone. He solves issues, gives advice, is responsible for the whole family. Brando manages this image very well, you believe him, you associate him with Don Corleone for a long time.Al Pacino plays Brando's son named Michael. And from the very first frames you realize that he chose a different fate. He's going the other way. A valiant soldier, a loyal son whose fate turns out to be different than he planned. And the character changes throughout the film. Coppola demonstrates this perfectly, and Pacino helps him by revealing himself in every scene. This is a wonderful work of an actor who got used to the role.The rest of the cast is decent, but they all take their place in the picture, allowing Brando and Pacino to be the center of attention.The painting perfectly conveys the spirit of the time. Gang wars, underground business, family troubles, death. All this is closely intertwined with the plot, perfectly placed in the frame, immersing the viewer in the atmosphere of an action movie.I like the picture. There are no beautifully staged shootouts, fights, which is typical for today's Hollywood. This movie is a classic. The colors are faded, the deaths of people look much more realistic. It's as if you understand that this is not a movie, but the decisive truth, if you find yourself in that terrible world. After all, the mafia and its wars are not the beauty that you expect to see, even if it is gangster. This is a horror that you should not get into, because the result is likely to be death: yours and your loved ones. Is it necessary?The soundtrack is also beautiful. The main musical theme is recognized always and everywhere and does not age even after almost 50 years. This is the test of time.Coppola's film is ultimatum, beautiful and cruel at the same time, it shows the world of gangsters without embellishment, makes you think about the terrible times of gang wars. But he also makes it clear that the family is a very important place, so to speak. A family is a home, it is a motivator, it is a fortress in which there are necessarily difficult milestones.Coppola's work is an excellent film adaptation of Puzo's book, which is a must-see for everyone in due time. Classics are immortal.10 out of 10.", "Doesn't anyone read books anymore?": "Check out a copy of Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" from the library, or just buy the book (because you will want to anyway).  Lots of people have commented on things they liked or didn't like in the script, not realizing that they are taken straight from Puzo's masterpiece.  As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren't \"hooked\" by the second or third page I would be amazed.One advantage of the book is it goes into much richer and more vivid detail than the film does (a lot of material from the book was used in the subsequent Godfather movies as well -- there's no way a single movie could ever capture that much detail).  It's a delightful and utterly satisfying tapestry.  If it sounds like I'm reviewing the book more than the movie, it's probably because it's a long time since I've seen the film -- but I re-read the book often because it's a work of literary genius and by far the finest work of fiction ever written on this subject.  If you're a fan of the film, please grab the book as soon as you can and prepare to be transported. You won't be able to put it down, and your respect and liking for the film can only grow afterward.", "It's the Godfather": "It's the Godfather! What more can you say? Possibly the best film ever '\\(0_0)/'", "Classic movie you can't miss!": "When people are asked what the greatest movie ever made is, many people say Citizen Kane(I being one) but others will say The Godfather. I would not rank it that high, but I do think it is great. (I think the 2nd film is better, actually). It runs long at nearly 3 hours but it is very worth it! It's just such an iconic look at the Mafia. If you have never seen The Godfather and are offered a chance, take it. It's an offer you can't refuse.", "A timeless classic": "The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn \"Godfather\", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed.", "The Classic,Iconic movie ever!": "It was slow burn the way every scene played it was amazing to look it's too slow yet engaging to look the meetings background were skeptical.the Music and the use of it is phenomenal whenever something is happening the music was way too calm and terrifying at same time!the story was amazing the family of gangster and the society of gangsters and there feuds!the acting was iconic especially by marlon and al and everyone was amazing as there characters!screenplay was good at start it was slow and boring at the wedding as it was just intro to what is next then when the horse scene up from then it was entertaining and calm to watch,the ending was satisfyingly amazing the way mike turned gangster was iconic and at last the look on the face and music while talking to wife was the signal that he's no more mike he's The Godfather now!overall A Classic Gangster Masterpiece the theme is dark and calm at same time.Iconic movie!", "Good film": "I watched the movie after reading the book a couple of times, so my viewing turned into another reading. Filmed very close to the text, and this once prevented me from enjoying the film itself to the fullest. I remember that as a child I took the book \"Seventeen Moments of Spring\" and compared it with the stems that they say in the film of the same name with Tikhonov. It turned out word for word and became uninteresting.", "Arguably, the greatest film of all time.": "The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.I give The Godfather a perfect: 5/5 or 10/10", "Classic. Timeless. Masterpiece. Perfect. Best film maybe ever...Must I continue?": "If you're reading this comment to decide if you should watch \"The Godfather,\" then I truly have no comment to that. That would mean that the #1 of 250 ranking on the title page, the name \"Francis Ford Coppola,\" the cast list including Marlon Brando, the \"won Oscar for best picture\" and the phrase \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse\" mean absolutely nothing to you.This is the greatest crime drama if not the greatest drama if not the greatest film of all time, so yes, it is worth your time. Then you need to watch \"The Godfather: Part II.\"This is a deep, enriching and beautiful film in every sense of those words and will forever echo through cinematic history.Looking for any other sweeping statements? I could go on and on. You can't say anything bad about this film.

Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble.

I disagree, though I liked it very much. The hype of this movie is as interesting as the movie itself as it says a lot about the world we live in and the men who seek power. I have seen and read intimidation used by people, trying to personally attack any who called this movie terrible or boring calling them stupid, while many other just jumped on the wagon calling it the greatest movie ever made to avoid such attack. A similar pattern to how physically strong, but emotionally weak men like Capone and Hitler came to power.The movie is significant to both world and film history. I however only give the movie a 5 as by todays standard its less artistic, entertaining and original. I also did not feel there was much new or original to learn from this movie and I did not get that \"wow\" feeling. I would not have much interest to see it again.This is one of my favorite gangster movies though and its certainly not terrible or boring. However it lacks in much of what I think a great movie should be such as: Moral points, emotion, surprise, humor, editing, cinematography, original thought, special effects, music score or even acting.(the tough guy role is not as challenging as it is to play mentally ill person) It does also not appeal to a very broad audience (not a movie many women and children like). It was great for its time, but compared to some of todays movies is very limited in the areas of greatness.If you like movies like old gangster movies or even tough guy movies like \"the departed\" and \"scarface\" or want to know what the hype is about. I recommend this movie it is a great movie for this genre. But it does not reach the emotional or theatrical heights of movies like \"Forrest Gump\", \"the Lord of the Rings\", \"Dances with Wolves\" or even my favorite gangster movie \"Goodfellas\".", "Brilliant": "The Godfather in my opinion is one of the best and well produced movie I've seen. I've seen it many times and it always feel like it's the first time watching. It's an excellent film to watch by yourself or with friends (movie night).

That's just the beginning of the epic saga that put the name Puzo on the map.This is a very graphic depiction of the \"family\" scene.  It marks the end of one's control of a territory and the dawning of a new era when Pacino takes over the \"family\" business.If you haven't seen this movie, yet, do yourself a favor: don't wait 30 years like I did.  Watch it!  It was on one of the premium channels the other night and I taped it.  I knew it was three hours long and I always thought I would not have the patience to watch it, but I did.

I say to those people growa backbone and watch some better movies.", "One Of The Greatest": "I understand that this film has been argued as flawless, but I'm giving it a nine based on two reasons from a personal standpoint. This film can drag on at times which can become a bit dull and Goodfellas I think is a better film so I can't possibly give The Godfather a ten. That being said this film still lives up to the hype. The story is fascinating, the characters are well structured and this movie can really bring out every human emotion in its audience. The runtime be damned, this is a film you can easily watch over and over again.", "It's the ultimate groundbreaker in mob films.": "Look at the cast, the director and writer, you know full well this is a film to watch, even if it's about an Italian pizzeria. Joking aside this was The Godfather of so many great mob films of later date. Certain well known Italians and Sicilians didn't like it, probably didn't run the studio and couldn't make an offer they can't refuse.Does romanticize these murderous clans somewhat, but does portray the Sicilian honour, blood feud and just business ideology well . This is a must see.", "Arguably the greatest film of all time": "The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family as they enter into a dispute between the 5 families.This movie is insanely well crafted and when you pair that with a phenomenal cast you get what many consider to be the greatest film ever made.There are really two key stories taking place in this film. First we see the development of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino, his character is given a great arc in the film and you really get to see the impact that the life of crime has on a person. The second key story is essentially the rest of the Corleone family. Sure we get certain subplots involving different members of the family, but it all is really used to show this life of crime.If you are someone that has been raised on fast paced blockbusters I suggest you steer clear of this film because you will find it very slow. But if you are someone that loves movies that dive into and explore a character and certain themes, this film is for you. The film does a phenomenal job of having a really straightforward story. We first get introduced to the characters and get a good sense of what makes them tick. As the story progresses it sets up different plot points and conflicts that leave you guessing what exactly is going to happen. These plot points and conflicts are constantly being developed and resolved throughout the film, and when you get to the end it leaves you with a very satisfying conclusion that wraps everything up perfectly.Overall this is a phenomenal film. The amazing construction of the story paired with an insanely talented cast will please any movie lover.10/10.", "One of the best films of all time": "This film really hits me right in the core of just how powerful the love and loyalty within families are. Also, the struggle within the power of mafia as well as the price on the drug-selling world. Even in its time, it shown light on these things far more than most films really did. Not to mention, the entire cast was exceptional. I could watch this movie over and over again!", "Cinemasins refuse to touch it and we all know why": "A famous YouTube channel by the name of \"Cinemasins\" who points out production errors in movies has yet to take a shot at this movie.

The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing, which is overly slow. I still love this movie! I think it's funny that marlan brando put cotton balls in his cheeks for this role. This movie was fine.", "Neither the best film ever, nor my favourite: the greatest crime flick it is": "Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio '70).10 points out of 10 :-)", "The one, The Original!": "While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,", "One of the best films ever made": "The Godfather is really one of the epitomes of what movies should be like. Although it is slow initially but once it gets its pace, its on a whole new level. With some of the best actors and magnificent direction, I guess it is one of the best movies ever made.", "This movie is amazing!!!!!": "Here it is, the big boss man Vito is sitting in his gold chair, petting his cat, showing power. The poor man is begging for money from Vito but Vito just taunts him. This is one of the first scenes and probably one of the greatest scene in the movie because it shows how dramatic the movie is by the Vito showing power and wealth by petting a cat and sitting in a gold chair.\nAs I was watching this scene I thought I might give my opinion and review on the movie The Godfather. I think that The Godfather is a great movie for the time period it was made in. When it was made there wasn't a lot of technology they could use. But the movie is ultimately dramatic in a good way and it really expresses the characters feelings and emotions. Even though it is fictionalized The Godfather does add historic information to build off their plot which I love that the director did that. They also used one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in a movie. If that's not enough to convince you to watch it then I don't know what will.The movie is set in the 1950's where mafia superpowers are fighting for more power in New York. But this movie focuses on one specific family, the Corleone family. But when the leader of the family, Vito, gets in trouble with the other families he asks his son, Michael, to join the mafia and Michael reluctantly joins the mafia. But Michael starts getting involved in the violence in the mafia and he tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife but ultimately keeps getting dragged deeper and deeper into the dirty, family business.One reason you should watch this movie is because even though it is old it got multiple awards for best actors and best pictures in 1973. To add on to that it got the BAFTA award for best film music. Now this is important because you can enjoy this movie, even though its old, and you can really experience the dramatic fashion of this movie because of the best actor awards and the best film music contributing to the greatness.Think about it, Vito's men are getting threatened and Vito is not having any of that. Then all of a sudden one of his men are killed and he says this line \"Revenge is best served cold\". Then out of nowhere two of Vito's men drowns another man that was apart of the gang threatening Vito and his gang. I love this line because it shows how dramatic the movie can be and how it expressive Vito is to go through with the murder.The movie is really good and I suggest that you give it a watch. It is definitely worth your time and is a 70's classic. And all the achievements and lines from this movie is amazing and will executed. Also this movie also influenced me to really go and try out different things outside my comfort zone. I really hope this review convinced you to give it a watch and this movie shows that joining gangs only leads to violence so don't join a gang.", "A victim to its hype.": "When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful.Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it. 9.5/10", "The Best Movie of all time": "The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their \"adopted\" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from \"innocent\" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \"throne\", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word \"Mafia\" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.", "Greatest of all the time !!": "The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and Marlon Brando's performance is absolutely flawless.", "\"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.\"": "One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vito's only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vito's bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleone's lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and it's easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because that's what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it.", "A masterwork you can't refuse.": "THE GODFATHER was a worldwide box office smash and cultural phenomenon ever since its release in the spring of 1972. The saga of Don Vito Corleone and his family -and \"the Family\"- has become so entrenched in the public consciousness that it wouldn't be hyperbolic to compare it to Shakespeare. And like the Bard's works, THE GODFATHER will endure for many more decades, if not centuries. Between the vivid set pieces, quotable catchphrases, and Nino Rota's memorable score, THE GODFATHER has maybe two or three competitors for the title of greatest of all time.Mario Puzo's bestseller attracted Hollywood's attention while it was still in the publication stage. After Paramount optioned the movie rights, Robert Evans, the dynamic vice president in charge of production, believed that its story of the Mafia's inner world would best be served if directed by someone of Italian descent. Spaghetti Western maestro Sergio Leone was among those offered, but he declined to concentrate on his own gangster picture, which would eventually become ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA.Several other directors turned Evans and Paramount down before they settled on 32 year old Francis Ford Coppola, best known for getting his start working for Roger Corman. Paramount's rationale behind picking Coppola was that because he hadn't yet had a hit on his hands, he'd be a lot easier to control. It would be a major miscalculation!!From the beginning, Coppola and Paramount butted heads over just about everything starting with the casting. The studio wanted Laurence Olivier in the role of Vito Corleone, yet Coppola could see no one else but Marlon Brando in the iconic part. However, the notoriously difficult Brando had generated so much bad will in Hollywood for the last fifteen years that Paramount refused to even consider him. After much haggling, the studio capitulated only under the stipulation that the actor sign a waiver stating that any cost overruns due to his behavior would be reimbursed by him.Coppola encountered just as much opposition from the front office over who would play Michael Corleone. He wanted Al Pacino, a New York Method actor whose movie debut didn't win executives over. Paramount much preferred marquee names such as Dustin Hoffman or Warren Beatty; they even considered an unknown by the name of Robert DeNiro -more about him in the sequel.The director's headaches didn't end with the casting. He battled constantly with the front office over just about everything. They preferred that THE GODFATHER be shot on the Paramount lots and backlots, but Coppola insisted on filming on location in New York and Sicily. He went over budget and schedule, but that wasn't uncommon for a big picture in those days. Nevertheless, Coppola was certain of being fired, and it's possible that the only reason they didn't was because it would be too expensive to change horses in midstream (metaphorically speaking).For the benefit of the half dozen people not familiar with THE GODFATHER, the year is 1945 and Vito Corleone is the most powerful Mafia don in New York. Using his Genco olive oil import business as a legitimate front, his influence is so far reaching he has politicians, newspapermen, and judges on his payroll. Much like any Shakespearean monarch, Vito has four sons: the eldest and heir apparent is the philandering and hot-headed Santino \"Sonny\" -played by James Caan. Next in line is weak minded Fredo (John Cazale, followed by honest, upstanding Michael, a decorated Marine recently returned from the war. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) isn't actually a biological offspring, but was adopted as a child by Vito, and is presently the family lawyer and consigliere.The movie's first half hour takes place at Vito's Long Island estate where his only daughter Connie has just been married. Alternating business with pleasure receiving guests in his study. According to Sicilian custom, no man can turn down a request on his daughter's wedding day, and among the visitors he receives is godson Johnny Fontane, a has-been crooned obviously patterned after Frank Sinatra.A vindictive movie mogul, Jack Woltz, is denying Johnny a crucial role in a picture that could recharge his sagging career. Tom is dispatched to Hollywood to make the producer an offer he can't refuse, which is exactly what the beligerent Woltz foolishly does before ordering Hagen off his premises. The next morning, he awakens to discover that something unpleasant has been left underneath his bedsheets, provoking a sudden, cooperative change of heart.Back in New York, the Godfather grants an audience to Virgil Sollozzo, a narcotics gangster seeking investment and protection that only someone like Vito Corleone can provide. After diplomatically turning him down, an attempt is made on Vito's life which changes the Corleone dynamic, as Sonny undertakes the reins until his father is well enough to retake power. Michael, considered the white sheep of the family, now begins to take an active role in the business.One of the most seminal moments in a movie full of them is when Sonny, Tom, Michael, and two Corleone capos are discussing what to do about Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain serving as his bodyguard. Coppola brilliantly -and inconspicuously- focuses the camera in a slow close-up of Michael as he proposes killing both of them. It perfectly encapsulates the transformation from good to evil.After the foul deed is done, Michael flees to Sicily under the protection of Don Tomassini, Vito's olive oil exporter. Despite the fact that he left behind a fiancee in New York, Michael weds a local Sicilian girl/woman while, back in America, enemies of the Corleones seek to exploit Sonny's volcanic temper. Though he never fully regains his health, Vito summons enough strength to broker a truce with the other family heads and arrange to bring his exiled son home safely to eventually take over.THE GODFATHER forever changed the lives of everyone involved. Brando, whose career was briefly resurrected, won his second Academy Award but didn't bother to take advantage of it, making only four pictures in the decade- the last two were little more than cameo appearances. Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton sustained long lasting careers, but even they will forever be identified with these roles.Aside from Coppola and Nino Rota, the one person behind the scenes whose unsung contributions was indispensable was cinematographer Gordon Willis. Nicknamed the Prince of Darkness for illuminating dark atmospheres, Willis was a genius who proved it was possible to utilize the German Expressionist method of shadow and light, and apply it to color celluloid. His bright photography of Sicily's rugged outdoors, accomplished with yellow filters, was clearlyclearlyan homage to Visconti's THE LEOPARD.THE GODFATHER dethroned THE SOUND OF MUSIC as the all-time box office champion. As hard as this is to believe, it only captured three Oscars that year: Picture, Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. Coppola's direction certainly should have been rewarded, but at least the Academy Awards committee atoned for that slight two years later when the sequel took home twice the amount of hardware.THE GODFATHER is an absolute must-have in any movie lover's library.", "Best seen on the big screen with no interruptions": "Strongly recommend seeing on the big screen again.

Just a bunch of crap and talking which you can hardly understand cuz one guy talks with his mouth full the whole movie and then a lot of Italian. Just a really suckkkky movie.", "The Greatest Film Of All Time": "The masterpiece brought to screen by the fabulous Francis Ford Coppola is nothing more than true perfection.

Francis ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is regarded as greatest movie of all time.And when i saw it i understood why.Everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining.captivating. and phenomenal masterpiece!!!!.JUST BUY THE MOVIE AND WATCH IT ...!!!", "A very good movie about very bad people": "Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York.  He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. \"Michael,\" significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three.  Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business.  He is something of an outsider to his family.But Michael is devoted to his father.  And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil \"the Turk\" Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life.  Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen.  It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds.  Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers!  Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister.  This tragic irony suffuses the film.  The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender.  The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the \"consigliere\" or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo.  Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.Enter a world where murder is \"not personal.  It's strictly business.\"  You will never forget it.Rating: **** out of ****.", "Film Perfection: Cinematic Mona Lisa": "So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of \"Deliverance\" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their \"labor\"? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family.", "Hamko Hamo": "Can we imagine the history of cinema without the movie The Godfather with its heroes, atmosphere and music?Who can believe that the filmmaker of this distinction did not expect his success after the setbacks and obstacles he went through?Was that legendary success a blessing or a curse?", "The best film of all time. End of!": "The Godfather is a timeless classic. Everything about it is just masterful from the performances to the direction to the wonderful soundtrack. Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes. One thing that also surprised me was how despite the Godfather being a three hour film, it is paced very well. I never felt confused or bored whilst watching it. It is an amazing film.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/ToQuF3", "Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...": "Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my \"favorite movie\" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.", "Unfinished unclear, can't believe this is top250": "Basically you see messy things like killings, distrust, disappointment, suspicious people and stories, sudden things, and it does not seem like it has ending, neither positive nor negative. Ending is like beginning, except that this time it is his son. Very negative and long. Not worth watching! Maybe good for older audience, as movie is old too. Old times, no devices, cars, or anything new I got used to.", "Not \"the best film ever made\" but certainly one of the great ones": "The movie opens at Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) home in the 1950s. His daughter is being wed and the entire \"family\" has come to celebrate. Vito's son Michael (Al Pacino), the most \"Americanized\" of his immediate family, has rejected the traditions of his ancestors and joined the army. He has no plans of becoming an errand boy for his father.Michael's older brother Sonny (James Caan) is hot-headed and overzealous. He is next in line to inherit \"the throne\" from Don Vito, although Vito suspects perhaps that Sonny is too heated for his own good and will never make it on his own. An important scene in the film is when he belabors his son about correcting him in front of strangers.A plot emerges involving a corrupt policeman and a competing Mafia family, who try to assassinate Don Vito and successfully murder his eldest, Sonny. Michael steps in to avenge his father's death, but must then be sent off into exile in Sicily for a short period of time to avoid the authorities, leaving behind his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton), who wants to get married.In terms of acting, its strength lies in Brando, Caan and Pacino. Brando is perfect - his trademark \"soft mouth\" being inimitable - whereas Caan is very good at turning Sonny into a multi-dimensional character. Pacino is great and displays intelligence and a certain suave aura, which is vital to the character. This was a glimpse of Al Pacino the actor before he turned on the screaming switch.Francis Ford Coppola does a wonderful job behind the camera, which is more than can be said for his efforts within the last decade. Likewise the script by Coppola and Puzo is very well-written with impressive dialogue and conflicts of the characters.\"The Godfather\" isn't exactly the *best* film ever made but it's certainly a great movie; a masterpiece that redefined epic cinema much in the same way \"Lawrence of Arabia\" did.", "Best Movie ever": "This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definitely a \"must see\" masterpiece.", "The story of the Corleones: Chapter One": "Before I saw 'The Godfather', I had always wondered about it; been seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie.A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations). Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time. First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more \"beautiful\"! The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion! The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!) Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being \"hit by thunderbolt\" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse.....", "Extremely good. A must-see in film-history.": "Coppola's classic interpretation of storytelling fits perfectly into this tale which many consider to be the greatest film ever made. The tragic life of michael corleone and his family against the background of the 40s new york underworld; a must-see in film-history. The scenes are extremely convincing and the atmosphere is appropriately dark and gloomy. The music accurately captures the epic scale and drama that the film is trying to get across.", "A Timeless Cinematic Classic; It's a Crime Masterpiece.": "'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone.From Marlon Brando's stunning makeover to the incredible acting of almost every member of the cast, Gordon Willis' spectacular cinematography, tight editing, the remarkable background score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), and almost everything else in the movie is quite flawless. No matter how many times you watch it, from the opening scene with Don Vito being asked for a favour at his daughter's wedding, to the final scene with door closing on Don Michael, the new ruthless boss of the Mafia family, the movie's three-hour long runtime captivates you till the very end. It's unlike most other crime movies with too many plot twists, action sequences, etc. The film is quite character-driven. It mainly shows the transformation of the character Michael Corleone, the war hero returning home during his sister Connie's wedding. Michael was the innocent and reluctant one in the family, who always stayed away from the family business. After certain events, he is compelled to take over the business, and it's sad and intriguing at the same time to see this character slowly evolve into something completely different from what Vito, Michael or any of us had expected. Ultimately, it's a movie all about family.Marlon Brando was not even 50 when he gives his Oscar-winning incredible performance as the head of the Corleone family. Al Pacino, who plays the central character, gets his career launched with this movie, and shows what he's capable of. Other supporting actors like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, etc. - all of them give brilliant performances.There are so many scenes and dialogues in the movie which are more than memorable: the opening favour scene, the horse head on the studio head's bed, the sequences together showing the planned downfall of the family (including shooting of Don Vito), and especially, the craftily directed baptism scene, during which the family executes a few things to finally rise up.Nothing can be pinpointed in this movie to be called as flawed; it's an exceptional crime drama. It's an astute adaptation, and the movie stands on its own. But if it had a little more heart, I could have called it a flawless and perfect masterpiece.", "There's no way this could be #1.": "After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow.Anyway, I would have to grudgingly say that the acting is pretty good, but good acting doesn't make a movie worth seeing. As an old movie, I guess that the overall quality can't be too great. But, even with all that aside, this movie still lacks a good plot, and, maybe even more importantly, emotion. The Shawshank Redemption really made me sympathize with the characters, while this movie just made me go to sleep more quickly (it was that boring).I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.", "One of those films everyone loves but no-one wants to watch.": "I follow recommendations on this site highly. I rented this movie and wanted my money back. Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end?  If so, you've seen 90% of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not \"best movie ever material.\"", "Perfect": "There is very few films I will give a 10. This is the film that help redesign a new era of filmmaking. It was so influential and so well made that the film is still just as popular today as it was when it was first released 1972. The only other films from the 1970's that I can think that is still gaining huge amount of fans is \"Grease\" and \"Jaws\". Now I might not give those films a 10 but it does show that films from the 1970's set the mold for films and filmmakers.Now \"The Godfather\" took us inside a mafia family and made us see that they are a \"Real family\" that does illegal things. In this film Don Corleon is the head of his family and protects his family and his friends. When another \"Family\" wants him to do another type of business he refuses and his family ends up paying the price. The family dynamics change rapidly and not for better. One of the 10 movies you need to see.", "Number one movie? It's madness I tell you... madness.": "I'm voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same. I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected.", "A timeless classic!": "This film was way ahead of it's time, even to this day it's still the pinnacle of a masterpiece. Every single element of this is amazing. The cast, the acting, the writing, the settings, the directing... despite it being quite a long film, whereas I am known to be distracted more easily the longer a film is; this film made me hooked on it until the very last second. I just absolutely love the story too, such a well crafted Italian gangster film all about \"la familia\".. if you haven't seen this film yet what are you doing?? Watch it right now!!", "I guess that this movie is an offer we cant refuse": "I hate gangsters movies, but \"The godfather\" is a big exception.I always listen about \"The godfather\", and i always thought that it could be a lost of time. But, in a Sunday, i watch the film. At the marvelous and surprise ending, i say: I cant believe this movie exist.\"The godfather\" talk about Don Corleone, and his blood. How his family enjoy, and the same time they suffer. Besides a great music, the interpretations are incredible.The violence is presented around the whole family, as if it a curse. This movie had a lot of good remembers, because is different story, a story of love, revenge, thrills and surprises.\"The godfather\" is interesting because in each take, in each second it takes you to the drama of this family, and you suffer as them.Definitively, this it is a movie that has certain touch, because the story makes you give curiosity, because we don't know to where arrived this family with this risky business.*sorry, for bad words... well, if there any", "A Very Good Crime Drama": "The Godfather is one of those movies that is good only for what it is. Some very dramatic moments, good dialog, some good romance, likable characters and a complete story. Its an overall very good film but not the most rewatchable in my opinion.", "The best movie ever...": "A masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the storytelling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)The '70s were the best years for Hollywood.", "not the godfather of all movies": "As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time.", "Francis Ford Coppola made us a movie we can't refuse.": "I've seen some great movies, but the Godfather is more than a movie. The Godfather is more than an epic. The Godfather was years ahead of its time. In fact, if the movie were to be made today, it would STILL be years ahead of its time.The movie was EXTREMELY long, and the beginning moved a little slow, but there was never a point where I thought to myself the movie was boring. There are a few scenes that take you by surprise, and a lot of plot twists.Marlon Brando and Al Pacino acted out their parts well. As ruthless as their characters were, as bad as the things they've done, you never cease to hope they get the last laugh. This movie was so dark, it's as if death was at every corner, and it was. The Godfather was an action movie with a story... a GOOD story. How often do we see those? Try never. I heard from everybody that this is the greatest movie ever, and my expectations for this movie grew and grew with every comment (I heard millions, and my expectations were already high). I saw the movie, and even with expectations as high as mine were, It was STILL more than what I expected. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I make YOU an offer you can't refuse: go see it.", "Decent": "Godfather was a good movie, but the pacing was slow and it's criminally long at almost 3 hours. At times I found it difficult to follow who was who outside of the main characters. I enjoyed it but it was just decent.", "The Godfather and Othello": "I am studying Shakespeare's Othello in my Literature class, and i cant believe how much of The Godfather (trilogy) relates to the play.There is xenophobia-Both Othello and Michael are military leaders who are somewhat distanced from their society (the trials in part 2) The idea of Othello and Michael both wanting redemption at the end of their lives by God (Othello kills himself, whereas Michael crushes his internal personality) Women become the object of the men around them, but lead them to their deaths- Sonny trying to save his sister from her husband, & Othello being destroyed by Iago's manipulations about Desdemona's infidelity The patriarchal society, where both Desdemona and Kay are excluded from society The over trusting nature of Othello vs the suspicious nature of Michael The theme of family and the destruction of family internally There are a few other similarities, but i cant think of them at the moment So i simply present this idea as something to look into.Hope this provides some food for thought :)", "What can you say wrong about this film?": "This is one of my personal favorites right here.  I can't say anything wrong about this incredible story about the Italian mafia.  The film is so good that it is mostly character driven, which tends to be boring to most, and with the subtle action, a person can hardly tell.  I guess it's the unique way the story is being told through the characters, how one man (Michael) must change all his views on life and morals to save his family, becoming a part of something he was trying to run from all his life.  At the same time Michael is working for his father's approval, even though they were on different sides of the wall of good and evil in the beginning of the film. I give this film an \"A+\" and a 10 out of 10.", "\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\"": "An underground family represented as a \"necessary evil\" address the requests of local members who are unsatisfied with law enforcement results. Here you will find a man that runs an empire, hoping his family will continue his legacy of justice.", "Really one of the greatest films ever made...": "The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think \"How the heck did they come up to this idea?\" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry. You'll miss more than half of your life not watching it. :)", "A Classic Movie Masterpiece": "This movie has everything a masterpiece needs. Excellent writing, compelling characters, and a story worth knowing. It tells of the politics of the Mafia in the 1940s, focusing on the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone is a smart businessman who decides to refuse to get involved with another family's connections to the drug business, thinking it to be morally wrong. When an assassination attempt on his life leaves the Boss in a critical condition, his sons must take over the day to day operations in the midst of the war that has been started. Throughout the film we see the truth behind the violence, the stress of being involved with a powerful family, and the political undertones of Mafia life. We especially see all of these effects in Michael Corleone. He is the youngest son of Don Corleone, and a war hero. However, due to the things happening throughout the story, Michael portrays a man's descent into a different life. Some great things about this movie are first off, the acting. Each person in this movie, no matter how small their role is, has a story to tell and they all tell those stories beautifully. Second, the language. Many scenes in this movie are spoken almost exclusively in Italian. Without subtitles. It added an authenticity unlike any movie I've seen before. Beautifully well done, excellently put together, an obvious masterpiece, even with being very slow paced at times. If you have yet to see this film, do so this instant.", "Dull and boring": "What? How did a film like this get a rating of 9? This bored the life out of me! For a start nothing happens in the first hour except a wedding! Once things do start happening the story is misleading and the plot is hard to follow. By the end of the film I was completely lost. Al Pachino has acted in better films(Donnie Brasco).

More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero.", "forgive me.": "This is the number 1 movie of all time-according to IMDB. This is a film that is as close to being perfect as a film can be-according to many.

Ever.I suppose there are those films considered masterpieces that for some reason or other one just can't like. That is how this is for me.

The carbage movies today can't even come close.", "Sucks": "I cannot express strongly enough how bad this movie sucks. Great music, great actors - but what does that give you? Coppola has everyone but his nursemaid employed in this one; Puzo's screenplay is pure speculation and nothing but - and the mob supposedly loved it; but people took this seriously: they really thought Puzo (and Coppola) had an inside track when they did not. And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled? No one gets this, but despite the great acting ensemble, this movie, its two follow-ups, its creator and director, and its screenwriter are the biggest bunch of hyped losers in Hollywood history.", "Boring": "Despite hearing about what a classic this is I hadn't seen this until now. All I can say is Wow!! I didn't know how lucky I was before to miss this but now it is too late and I will never get those 3 hrs of my life back. The acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow, those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard. I suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012, but at least that had some ridiculous special effects, all this had was some really bad acting. The best parts were a couple of LOL moments during the shooting scenes, otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and I fell asleep at least 5 times.", "Magnificent Classic Film": "The very best film of the seventies. The very best film of the 20th Centuatry, the very best film of all time. Most definitely. While it's not my favourite film, (Pulp Fiction is the No. 1) It's in my opinion the best. The story is brilliant. The scenes whether the baptism scene or Sonnys death scene or that horribly grisly scene which involves one man one bed and a certain part of a horse, are memorable. The acting is superb. Marlon Brando's best even when he'd already played Terry Malloy and Stanly Kowloski (Two of the very best performances ever). Al Pacino's, despite what many Scarface fans might say, best performance he is great in Part One yet he is chillingly stupendous in Part 2. The list goes on. James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazele all shine in their own great light. Many people talk about this film but they can never sum it up right. Neither can I. It may not be the most realistic Mob film, Goodfellas would be the most in my opinion, it portrays the Italian mob so well, if anybody told me it was much different i would eat my hat. The funny thing about this is no matter how brilliant this film is the book is much better. If you haven't read or seen this film you haven't lived. Period...", "The very definition of a Masterpiece!": "No doubt the novel by Mario Puzo is awesome by it's own standards but the adaptation of the plot by Coppola is flawless! Every character is given time to develop and leave his/her mark on the movie.It starts with Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) heading the Corleone crime family. Even though it doesn't deal in vices like prostitution and gambling, the Corleone family is the biggest and the strongest crime family in New York! It is made up of family and loyal friends of Don Vito- like the terrifying Luca, the muscle-maker Clemenza, the smart tactician Tessio, an adopted German-Irish son Tom and the hot-headed eldest blood of Vito Sonny among the others.The Don hears various requests from his troubled friends and uses his contacts in order to help them out, asking for nothing but loyalty and friendship in return.This calm boat is however rocked by heavy waters when the Turk Virgil Sollozo meets Don Vito Corleone to ask for protection and finance for his narcotics business. Don Corleone refuses. However during the meeting, Sonny shoots off his mouth and shows that he is interested in the deal. And that starts unfolding of a spiral of events.Vito is shot. Sonny is killed. Fredo, the second son of Don Vito, is sent away to Vegas under protection. Michael Corleone, the reluctant outside, who has led his life they he wanted, away from his father's influence takes over the family reins from his ailing father.Then transcripts a story of Michael from a family outsider to a ruthless Mafia boss.After Vito dies, Michael arranges to assassinate Tessio who's turned a traitor, Moe Green- who was a block in Michael's path to buying the entire stake in a Las Vegas Hotel, and the heads of the other families- Stracci, Cuneo, Barzini and Tattaglia! Michael cleverly gets his brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi assassinated who was responsible for Sonny's murder.With all the other heads of the Five New York Families dead, Michael Corleone becomes the undisputed leader of the Underworld in New York. In the final scene, he is surrounded by his loyalists- Rocco Lampone, Al Neri and the good old Clemenza who refers to Michael as \"Don Corleone\" before the scene blacks out!Unlike the Mafia films back then, The Godfather portrayed the Underworld as a response to the corrupt politicians rather than goons with guns and money!Undoubtedly, it still remains the greatest Masterpiece in World Cinema even today after more than 47 years and will continue to remain so for centuries to come!\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!\"", "One of the Finest Films in History": "Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the aging Don of the Corleone crime family, the strongest of the five Mafia families in New York City (Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, and Stracci are their rivals). He has four sons: Santino \"Sonny\" (James Caan), Frederico \"Fredo\" (John Cazele) Michael (Al Pacino), his adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who serves as the family consigliere, and a daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is the underboss of the family. With Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) are the caporegimes. Soldiers under Clemenza and Tessio include Paulie Gatto (Joe Martino), Willy Cici (Joe Spinelli) and Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui), and more. Michael wants nothing to do with \"the family\" and attempts to legitimize himself by going to college and the army, while his brothers are trying very hard to establish their names in the city through the Mafia underworld.The Corleone family soon become engaged in a ten-year war against the other families. They nearly slip from power. But they stand their ground and fight for their power.The Godfather is based on the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Francis Ford Coppola. The movie remains about 90% true to Puzo's masterpiece of a book, only tossing out flashback scenes (which are instead moved into The Godfather Part II) and killing off two characters that weren't killed in the book.The Godfather has earned its place in cinema history, it is considered a landmark film. This is a movie about family and careers. Not an accurate picture of a gangster's life, but still one of the greatest movies based around the Mafia. For an accurate look at mob life, watch Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas or Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco. The movie also started James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino's careers. All of these men are accomplished actors now.Marlon Brando earned a well-deserved Academy award for Best Actor because of his superb performance as Don Vito Corleone. The movie also earned Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie certainly deserved all of its awards.I, as well as many others, hold the film in high regard. This film is a masterpiece.

I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself.", "Family is important": "What matters is family, you pick a side and you stay on that side, if you switch side, you're the enemy and will forever be the enemy until you're dead. You look out for your family, and make sure everyone is okay. You don't discuss business at the table when having dinner. Power and Money - \"Business\" comes second! It's the Corleone family against Barzini and Tattaglia and 3 other mob leaders. The Corleone family is the biggest most powerful mafia family in New York, and the family you turn to if you need a problem to disappear. A lot of blood is spilled and Don Vito Corleone also known as the Godfather (Brandon Marlon) is almost killed in a shooting by another gang. Mike and Sonny are his sons. Sonny is his right hand at first until one day when he gets killed by a gang after going after his sisters boyfriend for assaulting her. Then Mike steps in and takes over, Don Vito gets older and more cripple and soon he dies too, that's when Mike (Al Pacino) becomes the new Godfather, and kills the 5 mafia leaders, to take control over New York, and eliminate all potential threats. Ah, I just love this movie, slow pace and leaves nothing for your imagination (sometimes I don't like that about a film, but it works in this one).

There are so many layers to The Godfather, so many little intricacies among the plot, that it is simply impossible to fully analyze this film in one review. With this in mind, I'm just going to give some of my thoughts on the film here.The Godfather does not really have one focused plot line that you can point to. It really just focuses on the inner dealings of the Corleone crime family. There are many things going on, but at its core, it is a film about this family. Through this, though, there are a few stories told. We see the fall of the once immensely powerful Don Vito Corleone, and then, as it would appear at the end of the film, the eventual rise of the family again under its new leader. We see the transformation of Michael, the Don's youngest son, throughout the movie, as he goes from the young man that wanted nothing to do with his family's illegal business to the man in charge of the whole thing. We also witness the terrible and bloody gang war that the Corleone family becomes deeply involved in. Ultimately, The Godfather tells an incredible story, or multiple connected stories, revolving around the Corleone family, as we learn about the inner dealings of this crime organization along the way. From the opening scene, I was completely pulled into the story of this family, and didn't return to reality until the end credits started rolling. It was truly an intriguing and fascinating tale that I couldn't get enough of.Perhaps the most interesting part of the film was the story of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. His eventual rise through the ranks to the new head of the Corleone crime family is so intriguing because of his transformation as a person that was required to make this happen. He becomes more and more morally corrupt as the film goes on, until at the end he becomes the cold-hearted, ruthless leader of the crime family. The film does an excellent job of illustrating what you have to become to rise to the top in a business like this, and shows how these leaders end up having to lose a bit of their humanity to be able to do the things that are necessary to keep their power.Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction is one of the main factors that made this film as iconic as it is. The overall mood of each scene is done perfectly; nothing ever feels out of place, everything always feels like it was done exactly as it should be. In fact, I can't really think of anything at all that should have been done different. The one thing throughout the whole film that was messed up slightly was when Sonny was beating up Carlo in the street. You see one punch that clearly was way off, yet Carlo still reacts as if he were hit. It's a very minor detail that can be missed quite easily, but it pulls you out of the film for a moment. Once you get a visual reminder that these are all actors on the screen, it can throw you off just a bit for the rest of the movie and taint your enjoyment of it. Of course, this didn't happen as everything else was done to perfection, so nothing really bad came of this one minor hiccup. The film is still a masterpiece, and a few seconds of confusion won't ruin that.The iconic cinematography of this film is also such a key part of it. The low-lighting used in many of the scenes captures the mood of so many of the moments, especially in the first sequence of the film. Vito Corleone's daughter is having a wedding outside, and the sun is shining and everyone is dancing and happy. Then, throughout the wedding, the scene will switch to inside, where Vito will be talking business with someone. In these moments, the background is so dark we can barely see the characters. This important feature draws attention to how dark and shady the family business is, in contrast to the overall upbeat and hopeful tone of the wedding. There are many more instances quite like this in the film, but I am not going to point them all out, as, like I said, it is impossible to talk about all of the details of this film in one review. In short, the cinematography and use of lighting are used to perfection to help the viewer derive the mood of the situation from scene to scene.The score of this film is just as iconic as everything else about it. The music is fittingly dark and used to appropriately set the mood at the right times. It is perhaps one of the best scores ever composed for a film; if not, it is certainly one of the most iconic.The movies epic 175 minute runtime does not feel excessive or unnecessary like some 3-hour films can. Instead, it feels just right for the story it is telling, and somehow manages to never overstay its welcome. The lengthy runtime feels completely justified due to the overall nature of a film like this, and there is really nothing I can think of that could be taken out without negatively affecting the final product.The acting in this film is absolutely outstanding. It's stunning how great the cast is at times. Some of the most interesting characters ever created were brought to life by these incredible performances.Marlon Brando is on a whole different level is this film. There are so many times you can't even believe he's acting. His iconic voice and line delivery has created some of the most iconic and recognizable quotes ever. The performance he gives is chillingly effective and almost frightening, and fittingly so. It is simply one of the best displays of acting I have ever seen.Al Pacino is also outstanding in this film. I believe he had the most screen time in the movie (despite his best supporting actor nomination), and he does a great job of living up to that. It is really his first iconic role, and it ended up becoming perhaps his most iconic role. Perhaps he doesn't outperform Brando, but he certainly does as good as anyone possibly could at living up to the standard that Brando sets from the opening scene.James Caan and Robert Duvall do not disappoint either, giving strong performances to back up Brando and Pacino. In fact, there is not a single member of the cast who I think underperforms. At the very least, everyone did their job well, with many going above and beyond to make this movie the incredible achievement that it is.And then there's the big question: does this film stand the test of time? The answer is yes. The Godfather is a timeless classic that I really don't see ever falling off. Many of the themes are still relevant today, and even without that, it is worth watching simply for the incredible cinematic achievement that it is, and the filmmaking lessons that can be learned from it.The Godfather is, in short, an epic masterpiece of a film. The direction, story, acting, cinematography, music; all are outstanding and iconic, and they all come together to make this incredible, nearly flawless movie. This review really only scratches the surface of all this movie has to offer, as there is just so much under the surface to be uncovered through deep analysis of this film. Because of this, I would recommend multiple viewings of the film to ensure you are getting the full experience and not missing anything. I know that I will certainly be watching this many more times in the years to come. It is almost undoubtedly one of the best films ever made, and one that everyone has to see at least once in their lives.", "Overhyped gangster crap": "Super slow moving and fatiguing to watch considering it's unnecessarily long runtime and formulaic structure. Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced.It has a very episodic structure in that things are set up, but never revisited. For example, in the beginning of the film, there is a subplot of one of the family blackmailing a director to put someone in his film. After putting his horse's head in his bead, he accepts. This storyline is never visited again. What was the point?This honestly put me in such a bad mood, and movies shouldn't do that. I want to enjoy myself during a viewing and be invested in the story, not want it to end as soon as possible.\nIt did have *some* interesting symbolism, but not enough for me to give it a 3/5.It honestly baffles me how many people love this movie to death.", "Simply amazing": "No movie will ever come close to Godfather 1 and 2. They are the pinnacle of Mafia/crime movies. New movies in the genre does its best to imitate what Godfather did, just look at \"the irishman\"...Truely a must watch for any movie lover, and a real banger for anyone who enjoys a rich story.However, it is a slow-burner, so maybe not for the action-lovers out there.", "Dont be my Godfather": "I was pretty disappointing i need to admit. But i wait for a moment and think about something: what they can do with a gang involved in a organised crimes, families's honour? Just some people who handling the business. I found also the start of Michael very good to watch and interesting to see. He is not uused to do this but learn. I found the movie pretty classic sadly. The violent scenes looks outdated now. What i found interesting i mean in the cinematography was at the end: the opposition of violence and the church scenes. That was interesting to see and look interesting visually. And the fall of Don Corleone make the whole thing more hard for the son, Michael. I also found the characters's arcs interesting and what they become. I enjoyed also the dialogues and have strong acts with families and honour. But it look really superficial but what i found really strong is the end: because we see the fall with the Don Corleone and the rise at the end with the new status of the Kid: Michael become the Godfather. And the image at the end was so meaningful and look the same as the father in some way.", "Masterpiece. Glad I could watch it on the big screen": "Well, it's year 2022, 50th anniversary of what is considered one of the best movie ever made, often taken as an example when it comes to scriptwriting, filming, directing, acting, editing, score, themes... you name it.If you are into film making... this masterpiece will teach a lot.Personally how character development and pacing in editing are my favorite parts of a movie.Anyway.. you watched it 4-5 times. Only on TV/small screen.It gets remastered/restored after a long process.You go watch it on a big screen, as intended to be experienced.Amazing experience.", "The daddy of the modern gangster film": "There is no denying that the Godfather is a classic and one of the best movies ever made. It is a saga of a major Mafia father, the upper echelons and there struggles. It starts with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the day of his daughter's wedding and doing favours for people invited to the wedding. The films shows the outcome of these favours, including the famous sense of the horse's head in the bed. The film then shows Vito refusing to take part in selling drugs and ends up having an assassination attempt against him. The Corleone family is forced into a tuft war before peace is made. At the same time the Godfather shows Michael's (Al Panico) rise in the family, from being a bit of an outsider not wanting to get involved to becoming the head of family after Vito's death. The film shows how person relationships developed and shows the characters as real people. It shows how the Mafia would have worked in the 1950s, focusing on deal making, rising up the ranks and showing acts of violence being conducted.The gangster film was not a new genre, their were good films in the film noir period such as Scarface, Little Caesar and the Killing. However I am not aware of any major gangster films in the 60s. The Godfather focused on the characters and many different and complex plots and subplots. It was able to bring in more violence into the genre because by the late 60s films were allowed to show more violence. The film also benefits from a brilliant script, the excellent direction of Francis Ford Coppella (this film along with The Godfather Part II are his best films) and a brilliant cast. Marlon Brando was brought back into the mainstream after gaining a reputation for being an ego-maniac, and help made the careers of Al Panico, James Caan and Diane Keaton. This was also the first film I aware of focusing mainly on the Mafia and how it functions. I remember watching a document on the making of the film on Channel Four and how difficult it was for the filmmakers, fighting with the Italian-American community.The Godfather and Godfather Part II are both classics and must watch films. I admit I have not watched Godfather Part III but that because I heard it wasn't as good and ruins the first two. It has been very influential in the gangster genre afterwards. They was Once Upon A Time in America which was similar in it approach, having many story lines and themes and similar filming of violence. They was Goodfellas which forced on foot-soldiers of the Mafia and set mainly in the 60s and 70s when it was filmed in the 80s. They are also films like Casino and American Gangster, the list goes on. They are also parodies such as Family Business and programmes such as the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. Finally their was the Sopranos (one of the best programmes ever made), mixing elements of the Godfather and Goodfellas. All in all the Godfather is a very important film.", "A Perfect Masterpiece By Its Definition": "The Godfather (1972) 10/10!!!Yep, it is still perfect! My 4th viewing \u2705 and my opinion hasn't changed one bit. I have actually notice a couple of new things that have made me appreciate the film even more! Quite frankly, it really ie insane just how good it is and how even 50 years later, it totally still holds up! A masterpiece of complete brilliance with genius storylines interconnected so beautifully ultimately making it super satisfying for audiences to connect the dots and really understand what's actually going on. The picture really showcases what life in the mafia is like and it is done with so much heart that you genuinely love and care about these characters as they are actually pretty relatable characters who often make a lot of sense, but yet are unfortunately born into a family full of crime! There are really not that many films out there that successfully manage to give the viewer an exciting and thrilling viewing experience, no matter how often they watch it. A real masterpiece by its definition filled with all-time great and iconic performances that essentially make up for an iconic, timeless classic that really has stood the test of time and presumably will be relevant! One of those films humanity can be proud of when looking back at pop cultural trends that have happened over time. Always a genuine privilege for me whenever I watch this beauty! 10/10.", "Coppola's Crime Family Classic": "4/4 ESSENTIALThe Godfather (1972) took many aspects essential to a film and pushed them past anything that had been done before. This movie takes the Corleone family, a mafia of sorts based out of NY, and creates for them an exclusive atmosphere. We get to see the Corleones in their criminal endeavors, interacting with the other crime families in NY, and working to make their family come out on top completely from their point of view. We never feel anything \"civilian\", nothing ever tugs at you that these people are evil. This is due in part to the phenomenal performances of (specifically) Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.As far as script, any screenplay that can isolate your conscience and also entertain you is truly Grade A for a movie of this genre. Mario Puzo, of course, had experience with this story as it's based on his novel. That made him the obvious and excellent choice. These characters don't feel like actors at any point, they feel like family. Every member of the family has his own strengths and weakness that develop over the course of the movie, and they balance each other out perfectly. It's rare to find a movie with characters this real... nothing feels forced.Coppola's keen attention to the smallest details makes this movie even more perfect. Look out for oranges appearing in the movie: they will always foreshadow a death in the Corleone family... He will always accompany the tone with lighting (a perfect example being the beginning sequence, which interchanges the mortician's visit to The Godfather and Connie's wedding with Carlos) and colors (darker shades of yellow and velvet are prevalent in most scenes with Don Corleone). Also, in The Godfather, there is a noticeable camera theme: fading drag-shots. Whenever these montages come up, they are accompanied by a very upbeat melody. Coppola borrows this tactic 11 years later when directing The Outsiders (1983).The Godfather is a true classic, and my all-time favorite movie. It over-delivers and then some. Make a point to see this epic.", "The Greatest movie ever!!!": "This is my most favorite movie of all time.Words cannot describe its greatness.I have heard all kinds of stories about when it first came out and how people were constantly praising it but it's for a reason believe me.This film has the finest acting i have ever seen.You don't believe - then watch this masterpiece and see what i'm talking about.All the actors shine:Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,James Caan and the others were born to play their roles and you can see how passionate they were while playing.But the greatest one of them all is undoubtedly the GREAT Marlon Brando who was so eager to play the role that he sent director F.F.Coppola a tape on which he presents his way of playing the Godfather.Coppola is immediately impressed and hires Brando.From here it's all history in the making.The most emotional and powerful moment is when the Godfather gets shot.Pure brilliance.Every time I see that scene it sends shivers down my spine.If I have to be honest every scene has its impact and emotional message.If you haven't seen the movie yet fix your mistake and watch it right now.You'll be amazed!!!", "The best ever": "The best movie ever made in my opinion, a pure classic with legendary actors in it! Must watch if you haven't.", "A true masterpiece": "What can i say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, this film is a masterpiece it is a cinematic landmark, it is in my opinion, better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is great but this is such a more dramatic film. I love the beginning of this film when the undertaker is asking Vito Corleone for justice, it was such a beautifully shot scene i loved how Marlon Brando portrayed Vito it is one of if not his best performance (Apocalypse Now is his second) of his career. Te Godfather is in my top 10 films of all time and it will always will be no other film can change that. The Godfather will always be remembered as the greatest film of all time and will never be forgotten, i just love this film so much it actually was one of the inspirations that made me want to become a film director and I'm only 14, it made me actually made me appreciate film and i am glad i watched this even its sequel was amazing and is in my top 20 favorite films of all time but 3 was terrible it should have never had ever been made and i will stick by that as long as i live but i love Francis Ford Coppolas direction of the film it will never be forgotten.", "The Best.": "Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency.The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!\" or \"I'm a superstitious man!\". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in \"The Godfather: Part III\"). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time.Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that.", "Long and laborious, and so very cold and pointless... how is this a classic?": "I'm a modern type of movie viewer, but I can appreciate classics, like \"Annie Hall\", \"Midnight Cowboy\", \"Forrest Gump\", \"Casablanca\", etc. I simply do not understand what people see in \"The Godfather\" To start with, I'm not really into the whole crime mob Italian Sicilian Naples mafiosi family thing, so it didn't have my attention at that. The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn't understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too.The story itself seemed very pointless... Michael Corleone kills a bunch of people, mob hits, his father gets shot or something, he becomes the new Godfather or something. Nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved. Didn't serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing. With thick accents.The mood was also very very cold-hearted. There's a general complaint about Steven Spielberg's \"Munich\" that it's very cold, too, that the characters don't have a warmth to them that you can identify with. \"The Godfather\" characters are like this too. You can't identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold, not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them, except maybe Marlon Brando, who seemed like a crazy old grandpa who's half-senile.I can't see the classic status of this movie. If it were released today, would it receive the same praise?", "Still the best after all these years. Flawless. Bravo.": "It's 2020, there was nothing else I felt like watching, so here I was watching Godfather for the 3rd time in my life. I thought I would just let it play in the background while i browsed my phone.At the first scene, I watched & listened to the man sitting before Don Corleone, fully decided that I would just hear him out and then get back to browsing my phone.But when Don Corleone appeared, all that changed. I was hypnotized.\nHe commanded the screen.\nI could not look away. It was impossible.\nI had completely forgotten about my phone.I sat there thinking to myself, how can this be? It's 2020 and this film is even better than I remembered it. I've watched this before already, I've watched countless of critically acclaimed films since then, why is this film having this kind of effect on me now?For close to 3 hrs, I had forgotten where I was. All I knew was that I was part of their family.\nI was there with them in every meeting and planning. And I felt every worry, every betrayal, every attack, every death.What a beautiful brilliant movie. Superb cast, script, music, direction & cinematography. Faultless. Timeless. Breathtaking.\nA true masterpiece.\n10/10. The same rating every time I watch it.", "Greatest Movie in World History? Maybe. Maybe Not.": "The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked \"The Godfather\" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me \"Citizen Kane\" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be \"Scarface\". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, \"maybe it's good because it is so real\", but that's not a convincing reason and how \"real\" it is I cannot say for sure.If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so clich\u00e9. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line \"an offer he can't refuse\" are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being clich\u00e9 make the film great? I guess that would make \"Star Wars\" the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than \"Scent of a Woman\" (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to).", "nice": "Nice one, finest character!...............................cool!", "REVIEW #500....a celebration of sorts on a film that is truly a classic in every sense of the word": "Ladies and gentlemen, I happen to think that this is a major milestone in my film review career. This is my 500th review on IMDb. I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather.For me The Godfather is true brilliance...I won't argue with it and I came into this review determined to nit pick this classic and try to find something slightly off with it. I couldn't do it...I couldn't find a single reason why I wouldn't slap a 10/10 on this...so I did. The Godfather is far more than a 'gangster flick,' it's far beyond Goodfellas, Casino, or The Sopranos because The Godfather is a drama, a deep intense, disturbing, dark drama that draws you into this political, violent, gritty world that this family lives and breaths and has for years. You see a man who grew up in this lifestyle under the most powerful man in the underworld and yet chose to turn away from it but is almost destined to be pulled back towards it and take control of the powerful family. Every scene in The Godfather is done with the utmost care and respect, the characters are so intensely created from the smallest roles, to the biggest and you feel like you're right there. From the streets of New York, to the countryside of Sicily, from brutal murders and assassinations, to marriages, funerals, and births. The Godfather is quite simply an astounding piece of epic cinema.Marlon Brando because he is Hollywood Elite certainly gets top billing for the film. I admit I have only seen Brando in a handful of films and The Godfather is the earliest work of his I have seen so I have not seen Brando in his 'classic' Hollywood roles. I just don't think Brando should have gotten top billing, that being said Marlon Brand IS The Godfather. The only problem is that throughout the film he is aged, delicate and sickly so that we don't see him in what would have been his prime and yet with every movement and word that Brando does you can envision Vito Corleone as the powerful figure he once was. Brando IS The Godfather...period. Al Pacino is the true star of this film. He brilliant creates the son of Vito Corleone Michael. As a character Michael goes through more diverse changes than anyone else. In the beginning he is a returning war hero, desperate to keep his distance from his family name and family business and yet by the end he IS The Godfather...Don Corleone and single handedly has saved his families future. Pacino is downright brilliant and I love his work but this is one of his truly best performances. Pacino was absolutely robbed by not receiving a nomination or win for this performance when Brando got both and didn't even accept it. Pacino turns in a better and more depthy performance by far. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot headed and easily angered Santino Corleone who is forced into the position of heading the family when his father is almost assassination. Caan doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserved but nonetheless makes 'Sonny' one of the most memorable characters from the film. Robert Duvall turns in probably one of the second best performances in the film as soft spoken, legally minded and intelligent Tom Hagen who tries to guide the Corleone family through the worst of times both diplomatically and strategically. He never dirties his own hands but is always willing to do what necessary to protect the family. Duvall is brilliant as well. This main cast is supported by a brilliant supporting cast including Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, and Lenny Montana (all of these actors stand out from the enormous cast as important and well played characters.) As you watch the film you might even think it's dragging a little and thinking it's a little slow but then you're so incredibly caught up in every moment and every story of this family that you're completely enthralled. Their are more brilliant and shocking scenes than almost any other film in history including...Michael's first wife's death, the horse head in the bed, the Assassination Michael performs in the Restaurant and the downright poetically disturbing murder of all the five family heads at the end. Director Francis Ford Coppola set himself apart permanently in the history of cinema by making this beautiful, gritty and quietly violent film. Mario Puzo wrote characters that have so much depth and importance and such real emotion to them. It might take awhile to get through The Godfather but every minute is worth it because this film lives up to it's powerful name and is truly worth the title of classic. 10/10Keep reading my reviews and see you at 1000!!! Come visit me at my site www.gamescape.wowchron.com", "Exceptional... !": "I heard a lot about this movie and very curious about this one and after watching the movie i think it is the most powerful and fulfilling ride one wants.It starts off very well but these are the turns which make that a wonderful experience. Lots of happening make in interesting and more importantly engaging. I strongly feel that this movie is not for those who do not like the revenge or the other way around about not found of mind games and politics.Now the hall mark is the acting of Brando which takes this to all time high. Alogn with this, Al Pacino did a well job. But music score of the movie needs a special mention. I still feel that the effect might not be that strong without such hammer strong music.In the end... just like to say... watch it ... again and again and always you will find something very special.", "A True Classic.": "We won't know until about twenty years from now whether the films we watch in the nineties are classics. Personally I think only three can justify such a title so far - Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption and La Vita e Bella. Three movies without anything missing. Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2.People can argue about Jaws and Star Wars but those movies scripts were rubbish. They were all about spectacle. No movie could compare to the quality of the Godfather. In fact the Godfather blows its closest rival out of the water: its closest rival being its sequel.The Godfather is unlike any movie I ever saw. It begins with a great scene as a man comes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to ask for his help in hurting a guy that has raped his daughter. It is Brando's daughters wedding day and the man who has come to the Godfather never gave Corleone any help before. Brando refuses. It is a brilliant scene introducing us to the world of the Corleone's. We see how ruthless the Godfather can be but we also see his loyalty to his family. It is a scene that will be hard to match in cinema history but Coppola goes on to deliver even more spellbinding scenes. This is the beauty of the Godfather - every single scene is fabulous. No other film can compare to its class.Some people argue that the Godfather part 2 is better. Not a chance. It's good but it can't compare to this movie.", "Greater than the sum of its parts. True art.": "9.8Everybody has heard of The Godfather. You may agree that everybody has seen The Godfather. You might say that everybody loves The Godfather. However, I disagree. It's been 38 years since The Godfather was released in theaters. Although everybody has heard of it, and holds it in high regards, I think that the reason why people enjoy the film is not because of its artistic merits, but its themes and pop culture phenomenon. I also believe that this type of film-making has been lost. Every component of the film holds together well. Each individual aspect of it is finely tuned, and it is seamed together to as close to perfection as the medium allows, as far as we know it. However, it is not the sum of its parts that makes film or art, whatever medium it may be, great. It is not a group full of musicians that makes a record great. It is not great technical and artistic style that makes a painting great. It is not great dialogue, coupled with a good story that makes a novel great. I believe that when these components of an artistic medium are in harmony, it helps to allow for art to form. The Godfather has all of these components in spades and also becomes art.The post WWII atmosphere, set in the midst of Italian crime organizations is engraved into the film. The colors are brown, gold and black, perfectly matching the antique tone. The acting is exceptional, with some performances by young actors that acted as a stepping stone for their careers. The music, while used sparingly, comes in and out at just the right times, and matches the mood of the film well.The camera angles, cinematography and editing are why I used the term near- perfect. There are certain scenes in this film that are simply the best in all of film-making. One of the final scenes, interlaced with a baptism, is an amazing example of using the medium of film-making and its techniques such as editing and directing to inspire emotion and create art. Another scene, which simply just involves one person against a black background, and a single light source above them, is in my opinion one of the best shots of all time, not just in film-making, but photography as well. The Godfather's greatest feat is not that it is a cultural phenomenon. It is, by all definitions, art. You might call expression and aesthetic values by themselves art, but ultimately it is pieces like The Godfather that inspires artists. There is a reason as to why half of this review is talking about art and not The Godfather. The film deserves to be seen, regardless of what you all ready know or what you think you might know about it. Regardless of its theme and setting, the work that the men and women did during the production of this film and its final form deserve to be recognized. This style of film-making is far and few between nowadays, and if you enjoy cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.", "MOB FLICK NOT AS GOOD AS EVERYONE THINKS": "I would like to tell everyone that this movie is highly overated expecially considering it is the number one movie in the IMDB TOP 250 LIST!!  Dont get me wrong i like like Francis Ford Coppola's movies but i have never been a fan of this series!!  He definatly has an all star line up , but come on people Marlon Brando cannot act his way out of a paper bag!! Just like one of my favorite Coppola movies \"Apocalypse Now\" Marlon got top billing over Martin Sheen when right well Martin should have been the oscar nominee!! It is a good trilogy but let me tell you something? If you want a good down to earth mob movie see anything done by Martin Scorsese! I wasnt really over touched by this series but i know it has alot of fans!! See ya folks!!!", "Oh my.": "A very learned friend of mine once said that this was the closest film would ever come to the great operas of European legacy.  I'm not inclined to disagree.  This was the finest piece of celluloid I've ever encountered, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It was tense, beautifully shot, unbelievably acted (Brando is a genius.  That's it.), and had everything else going for it that could possibly be good about a film.  Oh my.", "Tour de force": "Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by \"Goodfellas\", Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid.  Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding \u0091gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society.  While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, \"The Godfather\" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law.  It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself.Coppola had made seven unsuccessful films before he contacted author Mario Puzo, whose novel about a fictional Sicilian \u0096 American family of crime had become a best seller.  Urged on by his heritage and commitment to creating a film that would match his huge ego, Coppola sat down with Puzo (when he could pull him away from the Black Jack tables of Las Vegas and Reno) and re-wrote the story.  The result was a screenplay of supreme quality, eschewing the soap opera, meandering work of Puzo's novel for a tight, taut and fluid narrative.The legacy behind Coppola's involvement on the film belies belief when we consider how well the film turns out.  Paramount, by all accounts, despised Coppola.  Through the entire film's shooting a standby director was waiting to take over as Coppola's head was constantly on the chopping board.  It was at Coppola's insistence that Marlon Brando, who had not made a decent film for a good decade, be cast as Don Vito Corleone.  Paramount wanted Frank Sinatra.  Coppola also had to convince the studio that a young Al Pacino, 26 at the time, should play Michael Corleone, the aire to Vito.  Studio executives thought Pacino lacked depth and was too small and scrawny to play the part.  James Caan, who eventually played Sonny, was pencilled in early as Michael.  Things could have been so different.The story is based around the final years of the reign of Vito Corleone (Brando), a Sicilian immigrant who had formed a powerful empire of crime in New York.  Now a man with powerful connections in the political and legal systems, Corleone is almost untouchable.  His family consists of three sons; tough, aggressive eldest son Sonny (James Caan); weak, feeble but good-natured Fredo (John Cazale) and smart, quiet and distant Michael (Pacino).  He also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who also acts as the family's legal advisor \u0096 the Consilari.  The youngest child is daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  Sonny is next in line to take over the family business when Vito's time draws to a close, but his aggressive nature could be his undoing.  When Vito denies capital assistance to Virgil \u0091The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) for heroin trafficking, things take a downward turn.  Michael assumes the role of Don and in the process the cracks in the family empire begin to appear.  We witness the painfully slow collapse of the Corleone empire, as Michael's friends turn into enemies and the honour and code (Omerta) of the past becomes virtually non-existent.Brando was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor as Vito and it is well deserved. He is utterly convincing and memorable, despite the numerous parodies on the character.  But it is Pacino who shines as the ever-insular Michael. Starting out as idealistic war hero and ending the first film as power corrupted mafia boss, Pacino's portrayal of the youngest Corleone shifts seamlessly along.  Pacino is at his best when his character is faced with a personal dilemma, not one associated with \u0091business'. \nOf course the entire cast is brilliant.  James Caan commands the first third of the film as Sonny.  He is pure aggression, an old school tough guy who acts first and thinks later.  Robert Duvall is solid as Hagen and is at his best in the early scenes involving studio hotshot Jack Woltz (John Morley). Diane Keaton is excellent as Kaye Adams, the WASP whose life is changed forever when she agrees to marry Michael.  In the limited screentime allocated to her character Keaton gives it her all and is a far cry from the characters she became associated with in her Woody Allen films.  Other actors of note include Richard Castellano as Capo Regime Peter Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio, Richard Conte as Don Barzini and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop Captain McKluskey.  Even the minor characters in the film are memorable.The production design by Dean Tavoularis is exquisite.  The Don's den is brilliantly lit, or more so unlit.  It consumes its inhabitants in the shadows, and the Don himself moves with stealth around his cavernous headquarters.  Complementing the design is the brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis.  The film is shot with a soft yellow filter, giving it an aged feel.  When the film relocates to Sicily, Willis opens up the screen and fills it with breathtaking surroundings and the quaint, quiet environment of the tiny villages where the saga all began.  Then when the film returns to the United States and Michael begins his ascendancy to the upper-echelons of power, Willis turns down the colour and presents Michael as an almost dead character, stripped of life and feeling.  It's a great touch and is best emphasised when Michael woos Kaye, albeit without an inkling of charm, back into his life.  He gestures Kaye towards the car, which resembles a Hearse more than a limo and her life in his downward spiral begins.\"The Godfather\" smashed all box office records before it and spawned the \u0091blockbuster': one film from one studio that would be able to crush any of its opponents.  The film took home three Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (rejected by Brando) and Screenplay from Previously Published material.  With Coppola now on top and Paramount in his corner the stage was set for the next chapter in the saga.  But that's another story altogether", "The ultimate drama?": "`I believe in America' are the first words spoken in The Godfather. The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. My first viewing of this film was anticipated with equal amounts excitement and trepidation. How could a film of such enormous stature possibly live up to anyone's expectations, let alone mine? Over two and a half hours later I realised I would probably never see a finer film in my life. And about six or seven years on from that revelatory experience, that view grows ever stronger. With the exception of The Godfather Part Two that is. But that's a film for another day. The Godfather is now so much a part of our culture that it becomes difficult to talk about it as a film by itself. Entire books have been written on how it has not only affected change in the way films are conceived by individuals and whole studios, but also the very nature of the film industry itself. At the time nobody could have predicted that a lengthy (and costly) film set in the 1940's with a relatively little know cast and a serious and weighty subject matter could have made such a huge profit at the box office. Much like in the film itself, ambition and bravado is rewarded with great success and power, and this was true for many of the cast and crew with their subsequent careers. There may be spoilers ahead but the plot and events in this film are now so well documented I doubt anyone will be surprised.The film opens with a wedding taking place between Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie and Carlo, a wannabe member of the Family. While the celebrations take place outside in glorious sunshine, in the darkened rooms of the main house Don Vito pays court to various people requesting help with whatever problems they need assistance with. This is where Bonasera, a local baker, opens the film with the aforementioned line and seeks revenge on two men who savagely beat his daughter after she refused their advances. The subsequent conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film. Respect is always demanded from those in power and who are willing to use that power to benefit you. But there may always be a favour required by The Don in return. Later in the film, this favour is repaid to The Don in a way that is both shocking and relieving to Bonasera. Every element in this first scene demands attention from the audience and rewards them by setting a very high standard thereon. The way the camera slowly pulls back from Bonasera to reveal The Don listening to the story as we are, the use of lighting to almost hide The Don's eyes in the darkness, and the expressions, the voice and even the movement of Marlon Brando as The Don immediately put us in the company of one of THE great acting performances. Also attendant at the wedding are The Don's sons, Sonny the firey tempered James Cann, the weak willed Fredo played by John Cazale and Michael, the youngest and most cool headed of the brothers, played as such by Al Pacino. As with Brando, you are assured career defining performances by all three men, and I don't think any of them reached these acting heights again. Equally impressive but not strictly a family member is Robert Duvall as The Don's Consilgerie, Tom Hagen. In a nutshell (if such a thing were possible) the film follows the reluctant but necessary rise of Michael to the head of The Family and his dealings with his immediate family, his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), the ranked members that protect their Family (Tessio, Clemenza, etc), other Mafia Families and corrupt  state officials. Throughout the film Michael's views on his involvement with his Family change from the events that happen to his father after The Don refuses to involve his Families resources in distributing drugs into the city. When The Don is gunned down and left for dead in the street, and Michael has his jaw broken by corrupt Police Captain McCluskey, whilst trying to protect his unguarded father in the hospital, he sets in motion the revenge killing of both McCluskey and Sollozzo, the man partly responsible for the attempt on Don Vito. The result of the ensuing incredible set piece makes it necessary for Michael to leave the country to Sicily until it is safe to return. There he experiences both happiness and tragedy, as he takes a new bride, Apollonia, and receives news that Sonny was killed for a hit he had ordered on a rival Families son in previous retribution for the hit on The Don. Sonny's death scene is itself one of the most memorable set pieces in all of cinema. When a failed attempt on Michael leaves Apollonia dead, he returns to America, cold and hardened by these terrible events. There he begins to pick up where he left his life with Kay and moves to become his fathers heir. The phrase that there is honour among thieves is nowhere more relevant than in The Godfather. Michael, Sonny, Fredo and Tom are bound together by the respect and loyalty they hold for their father (in Tom's case, unofficially adopted) and the Corleone name. Their Family will always come before anything else, as shown when Michael leaves for Sicily without much of a thought towards Kay (being both Jewish and a woman excludes her from the Family), or when Sonny rushes to his sister Connie's aid (and ultimately his demise) after she receives another vicious beating by Carlo.\nSome of the most fondly remembered and famous scenes in cinema occur throughout The Godfather. The sequence with Khartum's severed head is an undisputed classic for both the shock value and for showing us early on how far and what type of methods the Family will employ. Sonny's murder is brutal and affecting, the attempted hit on The Don is wonderfully staged with the camera looking down on the event from above, the cumulative killings of the heads of the five Families at the end is a masterpiece of editing (note to George Lucas circa Phantom Menace. This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead', it's a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael's return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I'm a superstitious man..' and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?' the \u0091threat' is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo\u0085 At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That's my family Kay, it's not me'. At the end of the film he tells her `Don't ask me about my business Kay'. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn't swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don's eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz's continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando's face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny's death. Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we're in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great sense of importance and history from it, as though it's not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay's face and we've both been shut out, I feel like I've witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film.", "An Ugly Movie": "\"The Godfather\" was a sickening experience the first time I saw it in its initial release, and it hasn't changed.  I thoroughly disliked the film's spirit, finding it very ugly at its heart. I saw little justification for its existence, was sorry I saw it, and have tried to forget it.", "True masterpiece": "This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.", "A masterpiece! A cinematic achievement not matched, nor bettered!": "The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was \"The Godfather\". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the \"family business\". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical! Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance \"low-key\". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a clich\u00e9 ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire! Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\", \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\" and \"It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business\". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar!The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone! 10/10", "One of the true undisputed classics of American cinema": "Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don't know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone's husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it's a miracle it's managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It's also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola's head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it's just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Sicilian head of the Corleone crime family. His eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is his short-tempered and hot-headed heir, the polar opposite to the youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who is college-educated and has just returned from serving in World War II. When the Don refuses an offer to invest in the booming drugs trade by drug baron Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) - who is backed by Corleone rivals the Tattaglia's - he is gunned down and almost killed. With his father in hospital and still in danger, Michael finds himself slowly being drawn into the family business he vowed to stay away from.Head of Paramount at the time Bob Evans said he wanted to \"smell the spaghetti\" and hired the relatively inexperienced Coppola, who is of Sicilian heritage, to direct the film, in order to give the film authenticity. From the opening scene, it is evident that the gamble paid off. The wedding of the Don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), is a textbook guide on how to introduce characters to an audience. This long, gorgeous segment of the film establishes the Corleone's sense of family importance. They are all cold-blooded killers, perhaps, but they are loyal and have a code. It's also fascinating to see the hierarchy within organised crime, something that seems embedded into our conscience now after countless films involving 'made' men and capo's.But it's a combination of many elements that makes The Godfather so great. The patient, controlled approach, Coppola and novel author Mario Puzo's celebrated, Oscar-winning screenplay, Nino Rota's powerful score, the subtle dark comedy (\"leave the gun, take the cannoli\") the magnificent set-pieces (Michael searching for the gun in the cafe restroom is still nerve-jangling) , and perhaps most of all, the acting talent on display. Brando, Pacino and Robert Duvall (as adopted son and consigliere Tom Hagen) can boast career-defining performances from the picture, and can celebrate film careers spanning decades and countless awards. There's little I can say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, but this is one of the true undisputed classics of American cinema.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com", "A movie you cant refuse": "This is a trilogy that has Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in each one but in this film he goes from the nice, innocent boy in love who has a great respect for his father (Marlon Brando) to the leader of the family. THE DON. His transformation shows how amazing Pacino is as an actor. Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don't find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series.I do not.I think this first Godfather is leaps ahead of the rest, not exactly leaps maybe in front of the second but most definitely the third.While I like Heat and Goodfellas more then the Godfather I think this is a perfect 10 out of 10 for everything. The morals, the messages, the family values, the acting, the story, the action, the characters, everything in this film is flawless.This movie is one you need to be in the mood to watch due to the length and its time, but you feel slick after watching so many performances.This what film-making is all about.This is Cinema.One of the greatest movies ever made and it will be like that for years to come.A movie that will never be forgotten.A movie....you just cant refuse!10.", "Legendary Movie": "This type of movies which you get to watch over and over again without getting bored of it, they way it has been scripted, acted, produced and directed is really attractive and amazingly catching your breath, it has a lot of life lessons to learn from no matter what do you do in your life, it also shows the importance of family bonding and keeping it all balanced. I'm convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I don't even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully we'll get to see more and more of these awesome titles.", "This movie set the standard for mafia movies...": "Simply put, this movie is the oracle, answer key, the blue print, for all mafia films.  There has never been a better mob movie, and there never will. Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released.  I'd heard about it, but VCRs weren't quite common household items back then.  I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium.  So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see.  They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead.  The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom. To try to convey how great this film is in words is almost silly.  It has to be seen.", "the actuality of American dream........": "I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream.", "The Father of Cinema.": "The Godfather (1972) Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Richard S. Castellano, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, John Marley. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.Spoilers herein.I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. \"The Godfather\" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of \"Last Tango in Paris\". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of \"family\" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.This film, it's sequel and \"Apocalypse Now\" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like \"Scarface (1983)\" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that \"Once Upon a Time in America\", \"Goodfellas\", \"The Untouchables\" and many others would have ever been made. \"The Godfather\" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5 stars out of 5.", "Good": "I dont really understand the thrill because my country doesnt have mafia things.", "Amazing": "Amazing movie, such an inspiring movie for film professionals and film makers, there is a lot we can learn with the film, the directors view is the best part of the film,", "Epic movie, almost as good as part 2": "Great storytelling, every shot mathers and is done with perfection.

This movie, if people will live in earth for many centuries, ain't never gonan be forgoten. This is something that even in the year 3002, parents must show to their children, so they'd understand what means a masterpiece.

I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.I recall hearing that Brando stuffed cotton balls in his cheeks to get that effect and I couldn't not think about it during the movie. It looks like a lot of movie was spent on this movie to create the look of a certain era but so what.I could see people's lips moving and hear people talking but the dialog might as well have been entirely in Italian as I had trouble paying attention. My mind would wander and I really didn't follow the plot or care. For some reason, the dialog seemed trapped in the movie itself as though I was watching it through a window that was muffling the sound a bit. Weird.Many people may think this is the best movie ever but many people also thought the earth was flat in 1491. When it comes to movies, it only matters to me what I think.", "Unrefusable": "Akin to the world's finest wines, \"The Godfather\" deepens in vitality with each passing year in cinema.", "Watching this timeless masterpiece is an offer no one can refuse": "Most critics say it's Citizen Kane. Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years. This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes \"offers that can't be refused\". It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently: at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.That's an important theme: family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all.", "A real masterpiece!": "The Godfather is a real masterpiece directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay, which is written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is just perfect. All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema.", "The Godfather of Mobster flicks": "This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family.The struggle of the family within the family. Watch and see how Michael runs the family different that how his father did. Watch the changing of the world as a new generation takes over. One of Coppola's best. It can never be bettered.", "A true classic": "It is very difficult as a young person to evaluate a movie which is older than I am, but this movie is still very enjoyable despite the poor quality which comes along with 1970s movie making. I expected a lot of this movie because of its reputation, so I was a little bit disappointed but it kept me engaged from start to finish so I was still quite happy after watching it. This movie is so unpredictable it felt like I was behind the plot from the beginning, but I enjoy a movie that makes me think, but that might not satisfy everyone. The development of characters didn't keep the leads separated enough in my mind. In fact, when Sunny and the Don were shot it took me a second before I knew for sure who had been shot. All in all, it is a very good movie that would certainly be improved upon in the modern day, but because of when it was made, it can't be compared to modern films. I think this movie will appeal to most people who enjoy a deep, complex, multi-faceted plot.", "I can honestly say that it's overrated": "The day before yesterday I decided that I should watch The Godfather since it's pretty much a movie that one would have to see during his lifetime, but I was very disappointed. I thought that it would be a great movie with a plot that would be interesting, characters that I could relate to and give me some form of entertainment during the course of the movie, but boy was I wrong.I was pretty much bored from the start to the end of the movie and the only reason why I kept watching was because I thought to myself \"This is a movie everyone must have seen during their lifetime\". It even took me two days to watch it because I was so bored that I paused the movie and went to bed and continued to watch it the day after and was still just as bored.The acting was okay at best and I felt that the actors could have done better but failed to do so, and the director failed to even get me interested in the characters. When some of the characters die I didn't care one bit, not once did I care. They could have killed everyone in the movie and I wouldn't care at all because I could not relate to anything of the characters persona.Due to the lack of character-interest I didn't get interested in the plot at all and it felt like I was dragged through the whole movie with a barbwire around my neck.Today I plan to get dragged once more when I'm going to watch The Godfather 2 and if it's anything like the first one it's going to be a horrible experience.", "Not as good as I remember.": "I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and  at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might  be better.Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing. One more thing, this film certainly doesn't deserve to be the best ever, it shouldn't even be in the top one hundred, but it doesn't deserve a \"1\" rating, I only give it that because I want the average rating to go down.", "Why wasn't it Anthony Quinn?": "I'm not really the target audience for The Godfather franchise, but I did go into the movies with an open mind. After all, I love heavily dramatic, soapy stories, I recognize the quality of the cast, and my mother's side of the family comes from Sicily. With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?I'm not a fan of violence, but ironically, the version of The Godfather that I saw had been edited for appropriate television audiences. Much of the blood and violence was cut out, the swear words were muffled, and the sex scenes were deleted. The movie was only an hour long-just kidding! I don't know how or why this movie became so legendary, since to me, it felt like a B-picture starring a bloated, tired, low-energy Marlon Brando. This felt like a typical '70s movie, or an '80s television movie, with cheap production values and a has-been lead. I'll never, never understand why Marlon Brando was cast as the title role, and why, after his performance was seen during rehearsals, he wasn't replaced by someone else. Why wasn't Anthony Quinn, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Kirk Douglas, Vincent Gardenia, Burt Lancaster, Anthony Franciosa, Joseph Calleia, John Marley, or Ben Gazzara cast? Any of them would have been more menacing, more Italian, and had a more commanding presence. Most of these men made their own \"Godfather knockoff\" in the ensuing years. Marlon Brando - who, despite the sound of his last name, is not Italian - must have patterned his famous, never-endingly mimicked accent after a friend, but among my Sicilian family line, and meeting people during my trips to Italy, no one has sounded even remotely like the cotton-mouthed, whispering, jaw-jutting \"Italian\" accent.I doubt I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Godfather or its sequels, but those of us who aren't fans are certainly quiet. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm sure you'll want to at least try it out, since there are so many famous moments to the first movie. There's the offer, the cannoli, the bag of fruit, the car bomb, the fishing trip, and of course, the horse's head. Marlon Brando scratches his jowls, James Caan is a royal jerk, and Al Pacino explains the difference between personal and business. But most importantly, there's tons of self-importance and an almost tongue-in-cheek seriousness that begs the question, why were there two sequels?Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.", "Decide for yourself": "I am glad to see that I am not the only one that just does not 'get' this movie. It is spoken of almost religiously,and it seems that if you dare ask 'why?',your sanity is questioned. Maybe people are overwhelmed by the big-name cast,and have been told so many times what a great movie this is, for so long, and are afraid to say different. All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody.\nAs the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow,\nthe universally-praised movie and this boring and bloated bomb I was seeing turned out to be one and the same.\nWatch it on a rainy day and decide for yourself if this movie is worthy of all the hype.", "Probably the greatest mafia movie ever made !!": "Coppola and Maria Puzo take you on a journey through the shadiness of the mafia world where we witness the greatest character arcs ever.

I refrained from watching it years ago in my teenage years because my ignorant past thought this film was overrated, but honestly, there is no possible word or expression that can describe how wrong I was. The cinematography of this picture is so unheard of and monumental that every frame of this picture looks like something that could be hung as a painting in a museum. The story brings with it elements of something that came out of a Shakespearean Tragedy. I have watched it 7 times or more in a short time, and it takes A LOT to make me watch a film for a second time, let alone 7. It is one of, if not my favorite film of all time. If human civilization were to go extinct, this should be one of the few pieces of art that must survive for future intelligent lifeforms to discover and marvel at.", "The Godfather Of Them All": "It has been over three decades since its birth, yet *The Godfather* reigns as the yardstick by which all other gangster movies are brutally scrutinized.Only twice has its proprietary mien been challenged - with Scorcese's gutshock *Goodfellas* in 1990 and David Chase's superlative *The Sopranos* in 1999. Everything else runs a far, far fourth behind these juggernauts.From Mario Puzo's book of the same name, Francis Ford Coppolla directs the legendary story of an East Coast crime lord, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in the eponymous role), grooming his eldest son, Santino \"Sonny\" (James Caan) to take over the Family Business, that being, one arm of the Italian \"Five Families\" who run the Eastern seaboard's organized crime. When Sonny is brutally gunned down in an inter-familial dispute, Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who sought a life removed from the Family's \"business,\" ultimately discovers his familial and business instincts and steps into the breach to take the reins.Like the movie itself, its characters have weathered the three decades to become icons by which all other movie gangsters are measured; most of the actors in these staggering roles never quite shaking off the specter of their characters \u0096 which will surely haunt them far past their own deaths.These archetypes have become so ingrained in our culture that it is almost impossible to think back to a time when they did not exist; like trying to imagine a world before *Smoke On The Water*, or *Star Wars.* Very simply, if not for *The Godfather* these archetypes would not be archetypes. The movie actually influenced real crime families with its new street vernacular (\"Make him an offer he can't refuse\") and manner of conducting \"business\" (that of regarding any means to achieve an end as honorable \u0096 as long as the good of The Family was invoked).The greatest gift *The Godfather* bequeathed the movie-going public was its unapologetic stance on anti-social behavior. Beyond \"Man with No Name\" protocol \u0096 where a lone stranger would operate by his own rules, disregarding anyone else's well-being for his own ends - here was a FAMILY, an organized para-militia of sociopaths who followed principles wildly at odds with \"normal\" society's. Yet Puzo, Coppolla and actors boldly offer no excuses as to their characters' existence, motives or actions. After our Gangster 101 schooling with James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft, here was a blood-driven, wealth-engined world only hinted at in those previous gangster genre movies, now fleshed out almost against our will; here was a world where our societal notions of right and wrong were utterly reversed, yet which made sense in the verisimilitude of its own universe.Searing with grand irony, the first line of dialog in *The Godfather* is, \"I believe in America.\" And indeed, these characters are not mindless convenience store hijack artists \u0096 they are businessmen in the truest sense of the word. They are also imbued with a strong sense of loyalty and justice. Though *The Godfather* may seem apologist in its stance towards supposedly heartless criminals, telling the tale from *their* point of view allows us freedom from guilt when we realize that \"crime\" is a subjective term. As Don Corleone states, when opting not to murder molesters, but rather land them in hospital like their victim, \"We're not murderers.\" No matter they dabbled in gambling, prostitution, money-laundering and murder, they sought only to be self-sufficient, to keep their families well, and to live comfortably in peace - otherwise called The American Dream.In setting the tale in the 1940s, Puzo and Coppolla removed us from everyday reality from the outset; in this insular universe we readily accepted The Family's version of morality. It was no stretch to dovetail the authorities' actions in the film with our suspected perception of them in our reality. Matter of fact, it seemed to vindicate our darkest suspicions that the people whom we place our unmitigated trust in for safety from society's savage shadow dwellers are in cahoots with those very shadow dwellers who are trying to subvert our safety.There are scenes that will be burned forever into your mind's movie wall: the opening tableau of the Godfather presiding at his desk; the head of racehorse Khartoum in Jack Woltz's bed; Michael gunning down the police captain; Carlo Rizzo being bitch-whipped by Sonny; the slaying of Sonny; even seemingly-benign scenes like Moe Greene's meeting with Michael, where he claps his hands together and exclaims, \"You goddam guineas really make me laugh!\" \u0096 the subsequent bullet through his eye is another mind-burner; and the grand \"cleansing\" \u0096 scenes of the East Coast bosses being killed systematically juxtaposed over Michael renouncing Satan at his god-daughter's baptism\u0085 Through it all runs the unbreakable thread of Family. The opening wedding scene ends on a poignant note of a father dancing with his daughter. Harking back to the familial theme constantly, Coppolla reaffirms our deepest vicarious desires. We are all immigrants to some extent, the bonds of our heritages displaced, fragmented, growing weaker over every generation of X-Box and internet junkies; there seems nothing that can bind the strands of our familial threads. We find affinity in the blood bonds of *The Godfather*, on some level deeper than the span of oceans and the passage of time.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)", "Good, Maybe Great, Not The Best Movie Ever": "Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II.", "A true timeless classic!": "This film follows Vito Corleone the leader of a New York Mafia called 'family' having to deal with the consequences of ether moving with the times and going into drug related crime or sticking to the traditional old country ways of gambling. This effects his war hero son Michael who has no intentions into going into the family business.The Godfather is the best gangster/mobster movie ever made in my opinion. Its simply phenomenal. There's not much I didn't love in this movie a few things that were a bit dated but made the film even more enjoyable to watch. The acting in this film is fantastic by everyone not just the main gangsters like Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) who brings a chilling confidence in everything he dose now its one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history and it shows, its really good to watch. Same goes for Al Pacino as Michael Corleone he was just gripping to watch to see him slowly change from an good guy war hero to a ruthless mafia leader you completely gets you engrossed. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant too, always in the background ready to give helpful advice whenever needed one of my favourites and a really interesting character to watch. Then the less main characters like Talia Shire was amazing in this film she really played her part well. I could go on about each actor in this film but I won't there's just some of the standout performances in this film and I can assure you their are more. The directing still to this day is brilliant to watch its simple but very elegant. The script is for me one of the best written in movie history its got some of the most iconic lines every scripted and to have such talented actors its no wonder this film is so popular. The soundtrack again is so memorable at times it brings chills down your spine with thrill and excitement knowing something truly awesome is about to happen. The only thing I thought was a bit dated was just in one scene when Michaels brother Sonny Corleone played very well by James Caan where he is fighting his sisters husband for beating her and you can clearly see he's miles away from touching him. Like I said tho this just makes this film that bit more fun to watch. Overall this film has some of the best overall acting you are likely to see, some of the most iconic script and music you are likely to hear too. Its a must see for any movie movie watcher, a timeless classic and I hear Part two is even better!", "The original mafia story": "This was the first mafia story I saw. After watching this one, I saw other similar movies which a follow a group of mafia/criminals usually in a New York City setting, but this one still remains as my favorite.

You've gotta watch it, it's one of my favorites\". So i took my time and watched it carefully and i had in mind that this Trilogy is ranked as the best of all time.But to be honest, i expected more? Dont get me wrong the movie is still good but it can be slow sometimes.But what i do like about this one is Michael story, how he becomes what he didnt like. The dialogues were amazing and the music was spectacular.", "Just the greatest movie ever": "Not many films stand the test of time but after almost 50 years this is still the gold standard of cinema. And rightfully so.", "Such a classic": "The Godfather follows Vito Corleone, the titular character, sinisterly played by Marlon Brando, as he tries to develop his son, Michael (a young and excellent Al Pacino) to become the 'Don' of the Corleone family, albeit in a violent and dangerous, Mafia dominating New York.The first thing that I noticed was the lighting. I thought that it perfectly encapsulated the two natures of the Corleone family: the terrifying and ruthless yet fiercely family orientated. Corleone is constantly in the shadow, while also being in the light, and it highlights the two sided nature of him.The next amazing thing about this is the acting. Brando nails the mysteriously dangerous family man who is feared and respected in equal manner. Al Pacino is amazing and nails the arc of war hero, innocent and loved, to Brando's protege, as he turns into the evil Don. The supporting actors of James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall get a good showing, perfectly supporting the two main ones (Al Pacino should have got leading actor!)The score and editing creates this beautiful Italian set piece, and it's stunning.", "Pure classic": "THE GODFATHER is the greatest movie of all time.  There is no equal to this movie.  More then just a crime drama, this movie explores another type of \"family\".Mario Puzo writes a fantastic tale of family honor and loyalty.  Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone along with Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone.  I loved every minute of this film.", "An apology to F.F.Coppola": "SPOILERSFor the sake of a personal confession, this review of the Godfather is not as neutral and objective as it should be. For that I apologise, but with good reason.In August 2003, after watching \"The Godfather\" in what I assume now must have been a tired state, I condemned and criticised this film for being overrated, drawn out and dull. Today on the eighth of July 2004, I apologise for such a flawed review. \"The Godfather\", whilst still perhaps not worthy of it's number one slot, is one of the best films ever created.In this film, we are introduced to the Corleone family. The story starts at the wedding of Connie Corleone to Carlo Rizzi. As is tradition amongst Sicillian families, Connie's father, The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone hands out favours to those who respectfully ask for his help. At the wedding as well are the Don's other children, Fredo (John Cazale), the violent Sonny (James Caan) and the youngest, the war hero, Michael (Al Pacino). Over two and a half hours of film later and the lives of Vito and his family are changed forever as this one Gangland family fights with external and internal problems.\"The Godfather\" is a beautiful piece of cinema. With the late Marlon Brando putting in a fine performance as Vito, the film had a figurehead character. Ultimately however, it is Al Pacino who deserves most praise. Rarely can there be shown in a film such a dramatic change in a character over such a space of time. Going from a law abiding war hero returning from the Second World War with medals and a beautiful wife, Pacino's Michael gradually changes in appearance and style as he takes his place at the head of the family. Everything about him is designed to show the change in his character. His hair changes style, his clothes change style, even his face changes mannerisms (although partly due to his jaw being broken by a corrupt police chief). Pacino as Michael demonstrates just how truely awesome an actor he is.The acting alone is not just what makes this film great. The way in which characters are added and removed from the story is clever. Nobody is too good a character to be written out and everybody is given a chance to play a key role in the events.The musical direction of \"The Godfather\" is another part of it's beauty. As well as the obvious piece of music which everyone is aware of, the ways in which sound is used to keep our attention at times is superb. The background music and the location from Michael's time in Italy is beautiful. All in all, there's nothing which can be faulted.When I originally wrote a review for this film last year, I complained of how it was overrated and dull, that is a mistake I now regret. \"The Godfather\" is a beautiful film that I might not necessarily place at number one in the internet movie database all time list, but which I can see why it is there. This film is a piece which everyone should be forced to watch and a piece which, if they pay attention to it, they will love.", "listen, whoever comes to you with this barzini meeting, he is the traitor": "\"keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\", \"i'll make him an offer he can't refuse\", \"luca brasi sleeps with the fishes\", \"don't over-estimate the power of forgiveness\", \"if anything in this life is certain, if history's taught us anything, its that you can kill anyone\" etc. These words are still in my mind.", "Outstanding performance": "First, I've read and heard about this movie for a looong time before I watched it, and I heard alot of people talking about how they are crazy about this film, I couldn't know why all these people are talking about this movie as it is an invention that changed the history of cinema??all of these questions in my head had stopped suddenly when I watched it , I can't think of better performance for the whole line of actors like this one, what shocked me to the depth of my heart actually is that you are confused about who is the best actor in this masterpiece??\nThe Don,Micheal,santino, clemenza or even Bonasera in the very iconic intro scene.\nThe characters, the cinematography, the sound track looks fabulous .\nI can't really imagine how Francis Coppola managed to gather all this cast together most of them were unknown to us.\nThis movie is really a masterpiece and it is a reference for acting, directing, writing and everything else in the cinema business.", "F Fords 2008 Restoration- An Offer I Didn't Refuse": "The Cordleone family is modeled on a Mafia family which existed. The Mario Puzo novel was highly fictionalized & made for an interesting premise. The classic line from this film \"I'm going to make them an offer they can't refuse,\" has become the most clich\u00e9 line ever uttered from a film.Marlon Brando was well suited for his role in this plodding drama. The 2008 restoration of the Godfather by Copola on DVD brings this film, not only back to original form but even better. The set available now has all 3 films plus extras. When I watched to original now restored, I realized just how great this movie is.This film takes it time telling it's story and it is much more classic story telling over action. The restoration makes the dark film play much better than older prints I have seen before. It is in 5 speaker sound for home theater systems. After seeing how good this original is, I am looking foreword to checking out 2 & 3.James Caan, Abe Vigoda head a stellar list of folks supporting Brando here with incredible acting by Al Pacino as the son heir apparent.

Second only to Goodfellas and tied with The Godfather Part II this is the 2nd greatest movie ever made. The movie is nearly perfect.Plot: The plot is amazing. Based on the fantastic book by Mario Puzo this cuts the book down into 3 hours. Although I like the book better, it doesn't make the movie any less.Acting: While the plot is great, the acting is probably the strongest point in the entire movie. While I Goodfellas is just barely superior, the acting in The Godfather is superior to Goodfellas. Marlon Brando gives a very convincing performance as Don Vito Corleone(aka The Godfather) and won the Academy Award. James Caan also gives a great performance as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone which got him an Academy Award nomination. Robert Duvall: Academy Award Nomination. The biggest surprise however when this movie was released was Al Pacino. He's my favorite actor alongside De Niro and he shot to stardom overnight with his performance as Michael Corleone, giving a sympathetic yet chilling performance. Also got a nomination and should have won.Genre/Quality: As a crime film it is a great movie. The only thing that made it less of a crime film than Goodfellas is that Goodfellas gave a more realistic and gritty look at the crime world. It isn't until Godfather Part 3 that it shows the complete dark side of the mob. This one in some ways seems to glorify it. The quality is great. Francis Ford Coppola decolorized it a bit giving it a more realistic tan look. Some of the greatest scenes ever were filmed in this movie. Finally the music is fantastic.If Goodfellas had not been made, this and The Godfather Part II would have been the two greatest films ever made.10/10", "Stupid!": "The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth? I mean I like him as an actor, but this character is absolutely ridiculous.I don't understand how anyone could give an Oscar for that film! It's just stupid!", "VERY GOOD.": "THE GODFATHER is definitely among the greats, no-one can argue that Marlon Brando's performance is astonishing.

I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a \"rookie\" to the making of \"The Godfather\". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the \"Gold Coast\" of Long Island. One was the new version of \"Sabrina\", starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks...", "It was alright": "Even quite tense at times - that restaurant scene had my heart pounding, as did the hospital scene. But it is overhyped. Okay, scene composition and direction are top notch, yadda yadda, acting is phenomenal, but you can't watch it without thinking \"everyone says this is the greatest film of all time\". Well maybe it is for some, but the film suffers from high expectations as a consequence. Not that you, gentle reader, are interested, but I didn't rate it as highly as Apocalypse Now, Seven Samurai or even Star Wars, but it deserves a respectable 8/10 and if you haven't seen it, its worth 3 hours of your time.Just don't believe the hype.", "The Godfather is no doubt one of the top five or six greatest films ever made": "The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime \"family\" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch \"Don\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Silician immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American \"families\" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime \"family,\" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words \"Mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with \"the family\"). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink.", "Oh my Godfather!": "I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth.

With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and directing this movie has to be considered THE best of all time. Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDb's 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable. Nobody could've known that Marlon Brando, with two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic history.", "There are films and then there is 'The Godfather'.": "Just like Muhammad Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) the Icon of Indian Cinema is the Pinacle of Acting in the East, 'The Godfather' is the Pinacle of Moviemaking in the West.1972 was the time, perhaps never to be revised again, when the great actors of the Black and White era transitioned onto color movies. Marlon Brando was one of them and this meant the past, present and future of Hollywood colliding together to create the masterpiece of masterpieces. Alfred Pacino, James Caan and the young director Francis Ford Coppola were the future, in association with the best of the past Marlon Brando. Thus, history was created and 'The Godfather' was made. I don't believe personally that there will be a time again in the future of American of British Cinema when there can be Talent such as this producing content such as this. The 'Good Times' of Film-making are surely behind us as Ideas such as these and Novels such as these have been written, sold and the ideas have been spent.Like all things Filmmaking may also die oneday, but the story of Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather', which came in the form of a Book from 'Fact to Fiction and then onto Live Screen into a movie, shall live on for ever and ever.Personally my second best movie of all time, very close to the Sequel 'The Godfather Part 2' which is my most favourite movie till-date.", "a must watch": "Just watch it, if you don't like it then whatever, but worth a watch. I don't feel like explaining why.", "Wonderful!!!!": "Considered by many people (including the top 250 rank here in IMDb) as the best film in history, \"The Godfather\" is that kind of movie you just can't miss. Where else can we find great actors like Marlo Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan? In part II Robert De Niro enhances this trilogy even more.The story is about Vito Corleone (Brando) who is the leader of a New York Mafia family, The Corleone, that make money with gambling.His son Michael (Pacino) doesn't feel like taking part in this life although he's often invited to by his father.Vito Corleone has even more problems when he doesn't want to take part in drug business and when he sees that there's no one to substitute him in the family leadership.My rate 10/10", "Didn't get it!": "Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the \"family business\". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't \"doing anything\" for me. The entire notion of \"honor\" and \"chivalry\" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth.

I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.The movie's pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than \"Let's shoot him\" and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot.The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.The one good thing here is the music is good, I'll give it that.", "Maybe if the horse head got some lines it would be more interesting...": "Long and boring and not worth writing two sentences.

But The Godfather...I just don't get why so many people say this is a great movie. Perhaps it's to be cool and one of the crowd? I was bored.Yes, there are some powerful scenes. Yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story, as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies. Yes, it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start. The story is even interesting so that I might be moved to read the book. However, I found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow. I'm glad I finally saw this and found out it doesn't really glorify the mafia because I was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices. I'm glad I finally saw it so I could say I did. But I won't be watching it again. I hear #2 is the best...it has to be.", "Just about perfect": "Until a viewing last month, I hadn't watched The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) for a good five years. In the interim it seems to have got even better - if such a thing is possible.Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the mafia don whose empire starts to crumble when he opts out of a move into narcotics, only for war-hero son Michael (Al Pacino) to enter the fold, jettisoning his father's dream that he'd become a senator. It's grand and sweeping, and yet intensely personal: a wonderfully-acted fusion of family saga and human tragedy whose key players inhabit a vivid world of fierce ethics and bloody violence. Coppola and co-scripter Mario Puzo (who wrote the source novel) have plenty to say about family, honour and the American Dream - and the classic scenes are just legion.Some have argued that Brando's Oscar-winning performance is really a supporting role, but despite a lack of screen time he dominates the entire film and provides many of its finest moments. There's the moment he learns of Sonny's death, then calls in an emotional favour (\"Look how they massacred my boy\"), and a simply staggering two-handed sequence in which he maps out past and future to his successor. \"I thought that... when it was your time that - that you would be the one to hold the strings,\" he says. \"This wasn't enough time, Michael, it wasn't enough time...\"The old-fashioned storytelling, complete with impeccable production design, is augmented by Coppola's use of '70s innovations, like overlapping dialogue and informal out-of-focus close-ups, as well as Nino Rota's unforgettable score. The staggering ensemble includes not only Brando and Pacino (who is simply brilliant), but also James Caan as the last word in likable hotheads, Robert Duvall playing pragmatic family lawyer Tom Hagen and veteran Richard Conte, superb in his key supporting role as Don Barzini. It's a magnificent movie.", "Must-Watch movie": "This movie is a good one and its on the must-watch list, seriously, you must watch this :D", "Extraordinary Film": "I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, \"Omerta\" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime. Cinematic masterpiece.", "A case of the Emperor's New Clothes": "I don't see what all the fuss is about surrounding this movie.  It is long, slow and boring.  I'm partial to the odd gangster movie (yeah, I know, this isn't a gangster movie it's a 'family' movie...*yawn*) but have seen far better than this (Carlito's Way, Mean Streets, Scarface to name a few).Judging by the comments left on IMDB people say this movie is great due to the acting, the cinematography, the direction etc....what about the plot? The characters?  Isn't that what makes a good movie?  Or are the people who so verbosely extol the virtues of The Godfather all film/media students studying it for their coursework?  Do people say this is a great movie because that's what they hear everyone else say?The Godfather is not a good movie and the emperor is well and truly naked.", "I don't get it": "Ok, I'm two hours into this film and I just don't get the hype and appeal. I admit my choices in movie are varied (my top five films are \"American Beauty\", \"Donnie Darko\", \"Casablanca\", \"Henry V\" and \"When Harry Met Sally\"), but I watched this film with possibly too much expectation. A friend of mine adores this film, and any Mafia film in general, and along with the vast majority of imdb members, he recommended this film to me. The problem is, why?Don't get me wrong though, before someone starts to condemn me, I appreciate the acting, I understand that Al Pacino performs stunningly throughout, I admit that Marlon Brando is another highlight (although his voice annoys me slightly throughout), but I just don't see why people adore this film. Ok, after reading reviews, the obvious differences between people are blatant. Some people adore this film and consider it the best ever, some dislike it. All that is fair enough. Sadly though, I feel I am slightly more towards the later. I don't dislike this film, it has highlights, but I can't help but feel it is long winded, infuriatingly complicated & at times, ridiculously slow. Graphically, it is superb, acting is tremendous, but I just feel the plot doesn't hold upto scratch.Perhaps I am a fool, but I just fail to get the hype. Perhaps if I was more of a fan of Mafia films I'd appreciate it more, perhaps. Perhaps if I'd seen it at the cinema in 1972 I'd love it, perhaps. However, after watching it at such a relatively late age of 20 in 2003, I might enjoy this film, I might like a few scenes a lot, but I really fail to understand how it could make it to number 1 in people's lists. I guess in the end of the day, it is all down to opinion.", "musings on a classic": "A few thoughts and observations on an American classic- I doubt 'The Godfather' was shot sequentially (hardly any movies are) but it sure seems to me that the first scene, the wedding scene, was also the first one filmed. The reason I say this is that none of the actors seem completely comfortable with their characters yet; it's as though they're still figuring them out, unlike later in the film, where almost all the actors absolutely inhabit their roles. The same goes for the direction and dialogue, which contains some heavy-handed exposition that is noticeably missing later on too. (Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen tells his wife at one point that he has to go back to work because no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. Oh really? His wife never knew this? She's finding out just now, in the middle of the festivities?) As Sonny, James Caan is still working on his swagger, and even Marlon Brando is shown at his desk, holding a cat and stroking it, as though he's auditioning to be the next James Bond villain. (There are no further shots of him holding a cat.) This early awkwardness soon passes but the next scene is just as confounding, in a different way. Hagen is sent to California to convince a Hollywood producer to give a movie role to Johnny Fontaine, Don Corleone's godson. This scene sticks out like a sore thumb now and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, despite providing 'The Godfather' with one of its most famous images, that of the severed horse-head in the movie producer's bed. No, it's only when Hagen returns to New York that the film really begins. The first several times I saw 'The Godfather,' I had a difficult time breaking it down into segments and sections, as in what happened in relation to other things going on in the film. This of course is the sign of smart scripting and directorial slight-of-hand, and clever pacing which keeps you guessing. For instance, the different scenes where Luca Brazi is killed, then Don Corleone is shot, Tom Hagen is briefly kidnapped by Sallozzo, and Michael Corleone finds out what has happened. These all seem to happen at roughly the same time, but Michael finds out from a newspaper! Yet one never questions it while watching. There are so many great and famous scenes, it's hard to pick favorites, but I notice now when I watch it, I particularly enjoy the one where Don Corleone and his inner circle meet with Sallozzo, just before the aforementioned violence. It's one of the few times in the lengthy film where we actually get to see the Don at work guiding his empire and making decisions. Not a great deal happens in the scene, but it's a good example of Don Corleone's thinking and helps explain why he is held in such high regard, why he is in fact the 'irreplaceable man', as will soon become apparent. Sonny is obviously to be his successor, and just as obviously lacks the old man's reasoning and negotiating skills. Fredo is just another body in the room and Michael isn't yet \"with\" them. Despite the incredible wealth and influence we've seen the Corleone family possess, this scene and its immediate aftermath show just how fragile and tenuous its grip on power is in dangerous circumstances. The relative ease with which the Don is set up and shot, as well as the quick dispensing of his main hit-man, Luca Brazi (who had been portrayed as almost invincible), proves that Sallozzo was correct, in the short term anyway: get rid of the Don and his empire collapses into confusion. The rest of the film is more or less the laying out of a careful and methodical revenge plotted by both Michael and the old Don, following a major subplot having to do with Michael hiding out in Sicily after killing Sallozzo and a New York police captain. It all leads to perhaps the most famous scene of all in 'The Godfather,' the baptism sequence where everyone who plotted against the Corleones get their comeuppance, from Connie's husband Carlo to the rival Mafia chieftains who hoped to exploit the Corleone family's momentary weakness. That it feels like justice being served says something about how Coppola has successfully manipulated the audience into rooting for the Corleones. The word 'adventure' doesn't usually come to mind when discussing 'The Godfather,' but that's what it is, an astonishing adventure for the characters and an eye-opening look inside a powerful crime family for the audience.", "My #4 favorite film of all time (including part 2)": "What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far. Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family.", "Great American Tragedy (SPOILERS)": "I suppose it's difficult to qualify exactly what formulates a tragedy.  Are tragedies about fate, disillusionment or death?  Are they about language? Must the plot adhere to a strict set of rules?  Must the climax come in the third act?  Well, my concept of a tragedy is when the flaws of one or more of its characters destroy a high goal.  In the case of the Godfather, this goal is the prevention of Michael's entry into the family business by making him a true American; the tragic flaw is Michael's inability to forego vengeance.Certainly many efforts are made to prevent Michael's tragic fate.  Michael himself seeks to evade becoming like his family.  When telling Kay about how his father released Johnny Fontaine from a band contract by making the band leader `an offer he couldn't refuse,' Michael says, `That's my family Kay, not me.'  While the rest of his family wears tuxedos at the wedding, Michael wears his dress uniform.  While his family talks about the drug business with Solozzo, Michael and Kay go shopping and go to the movies. \nBy the time Michael saves his father in the hospital, it is already clear that Michael has no desire to be involved in the family business, but the attempt on his father's life is the first revelation of Michael's tragic flaw.  In the scene where Michael agrees to kill Solozzo and McClusky, Hagen tells Sonny that he is taking business matters personally.  When Michael agrees to kill them both, Sonny accuses him of the same.  Of course, a central irony of the Godfather is the fact that the family is the business, ties of blood and ties of money become inseparable.  Sonny's accusations are correct, Michael is taking the matter personally, the only major difference between Michael and Sonny is Michael's calculating patience.  This difference is painfully obvious by the end of the film.  Sonny dies because he carelessly charged after Carlo when he discovered that Connie was beaten after his initial death threat.  Michael waits for the perfect opportunity to have Carlo murdered, never allowing Carlo to suspect his motives.  After his betrayal, Tessio asks Tom Hagen to `tell Michael it was strictly business.'  Hagen replies that Michael knows.  Despite the fact that murdering Tessio and losing his knowledge of the Bronx is bad business, Michael has him killed.  This is further evidence that Michael is not acting out of his business interests, but his inability to forego vengeance.Kay is a very important figure in this tragedy, I say `figure' because to Michael, Kay as a person is irrelevant.  Kay's value to Michael is her lack of connection to his family.  She is from New Hampshire, so he most likely met her at Dartmouth (he went to college while his other brothers learned the family business). At the beginning of the film, Michael has Kay appear in his family photo.  He tells her everything about his family and while his family is planning, he is spending time with her notably shopping at the store `Best & Co.' and watching a movie about a nun.  These details are significant because Michael views Kay as a better sort of person than his family; he sees her as a figure of salvation.  When he returns from Italy and has entered the family business, Michael tells Kay that he has to marry her.  `The old way is finished.  Even my father knows that now.  In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.'  Michael sees Kay as a figure through which he will achieve that legitimacy.  When Kay asks Michael if he had Carlo killed Michael's reaction is the exact opposite of what he would have told her at the beginning of the film.  Instead of telling Kay everything and defying the old rule of never letting women know about the family business, Michael told her all of his family's stories willingly and with complete honesty.  In this scene, Michael reveals not only that he won't let Kay know about his affairs, but lies he finally agrees.  The final shot of the movie, the closing of the door as a wiping fade out is significant because it shows Kay's separation from Michael.  She has literally and figuratively been removed from him, salvation rejected.Easily the most telling scene on this film's tragedy is the scene in which Vito tells Michael that he `didn't want this' for him.  He tells Michael that he wanted him to be a Senator or a Governor.  This is interesting when compared to Michael's rationalization of his work to Kay in which he suggests that all men of power are the same.  Vito dies in the very next scene of natural causes, but with the knowledge that the son for whom he had such great hope had been damned. The scene immediately following the death of Vito is the baptism of Michael's nephew, which is brilliantly cross-cut with the murders of the heads of the five families and Mo Green is a sequence in which holy water is crosscut with blood, renunciation of Satan is juxtaposed with acts of murder and the sacred is connected to the vile.  Vito's way of doing things is finished.  Vito openly told the heads of the families that `I forego the vengeance on my son' and `I will not be the man to break the peace of this day.'  It is Michael who breaks the peace.  Vito was a reluctant Godfather who spend his life running `harmless vices' and declaring that `we're not murderers' when refusing to hit the men who assaulted Bonassera's daughter, ultimately has a cold, calculating man who rationalizes murder as his successor, defying all his hopes for the future.", "Fantastic": "Greatest movie you can ever see.

Probably because I knew it was a long, weighty movie with a massive reputation and I wanted to make sure I gave it justice.Well I finally took the plunge and watched it, and I'm sorry to say I don't know what all the fuss is about. This probably won't be very popular - but this movie is way way too slow. There is a lot of talking and very little action, which would be OK if the dialogue was special - it isn't.What saves The Godfather for me is the performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular - you can tell they are at the peak of their powers and giving the performance everything. Their characters are complex and interesting. Brando as Don Vito Corleone is a criminal but with a good heart. Al Pacino wants to avoid crime but he has a streak of evil in him. The development of the characters and handover of the criminal empire keeps the otherwise dull storyline ticking over.I've given this movie a 7/10 on the strength of the performance, but I won't be watching it again.", "Timeless masterpiece": "Absolute masterpiece, an unforgettable mafia family saga.", "If you can't see it, don't force yourself!Because: one day, you'll feel sorry": "The whole Godfather series is about the growth and death of a man, the rise and decline of a family. Brotherhood, father son relationship, rational and emotional love, friendship, men's sacrifice and responsibility in the face of family, career and love, the opposition and unity of justice and evil are vividly interpreted in the film. Countless classic lines and unforgettable plots.I am the same myself. In his early 20's, he stepped into the society, had contact with the world at the beginning, just opened the chapter of his life, and watching Godfather certainly felt obscure and gloomy. At this age, it's normal that we can't look down: we haven't understood the responsibilities and responsibilities of career, family, friendship and love, and we can't even know the cost of men's growth.When you are a little older, no one will help you or forgive you unconditionally. You are forced to understand that you need to work hard in society to survive. No one will give you money without any reason. Naturally, you will understand the difficulties and greatness of the old Godfather", "From simple to perfect": "The great example of how to execute a scene Synopsis Michael arrives to visit his father at the hospital and realizes that no one protects him and he knows that he is too vulnerable. It is a very difficult situation but Enzo arrives and says that he can count on his help and Michael tells him that he is waiting outside the hospital (at the door) Enzo obeys He throws the flowers away, puts his hands in his pockets and lifts her collar. (remember that Enzo and Michael are not used to dealing with this type of problem, they are not murderers, they are just 2 people outside a hospital)After that action, a car is seen arriving, but seeing precisely 2 guys standing outside, they prefer not to take risks and do not go in to attack. They realize? With just an action as simple as being outside a hospital, they stopped the possible murder of Vito Corleone And it is not unlikely at all, on the contrary, it is very logical that they would not want to enter just by seeing them there since they deduced that there would be more than them. It is impressive how they manage to narrate this whole situation and solve it in a simple but logical way If you think about it, this whole scene contains the 4 levels of conflict And it is essential since Michael for the first time acts as a corleone With this you realize that no, it's godfather it's not like any movie it's ART. The entire film is narrated by someone who knew exactly what to tell and how to do it, and this can be easily seen by how a simple action of standing outside a door has everything to do with it. A plot weight behind. This doesn't need great special effects or illogical stuff, this had a great writer, director and acting. Without a doubt, no one can deny that The Godfather is a masterpiece.", "Why The Godfather Rocks !!!": "I saw the movie some years back mainly due to the hype.. I liked it & would have given it 6/10 at that time..Three years later I bought the book(accidentally).. Well just for the sake of buying something really wasn't going to read it anyway (so I thought)..A few days later I read a few pages & started loving it.. I was hooked on to the book like a Harry Potter fan & couldn't put it down..THEN..I watched the movie ... Then I knew why there was so much hype around the movie even after 30 years...The movie just brought back the characters to life...I loved it & thus the rating 9.6/10 However the movie is not as good as the book.... but I think it's as close a movie will ever get to the original.. Which by the way is a masterpiece..The casting for the movie is flawless..You really feel that they belong in the book..All in all The Godfather won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing (adapted screenplay) (Francis Coppola, Mario Puzo)... The film was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards. Furthermore, it won five Golden Globes, one Grammy, and numerous other awards...My final piece of advice...\"READ THE BOOK THEN WATCH THE MOVIE\"If you really want to enjoy it..", "A Landmark Picture": "(WARNING: Plot Spoilers)\nIf you have not seen the Godfather, do yourself a favour - skip my comments, and rent it today! I have seen this movie too many times to comment without giving away key elements.This movie is a cinematic landmark - one of the great achievements of the 20th century. From its quiet opening in Vito Corleone's office, with the the blubbering appeal of Amerigo Bonasera (\"Make them suffer as I have suffered\") to the closing of that same office door at the end, when Kaye comes to grips with the man she married, every frame of this film is filled with intrigue, images and treachery.You cannot view this film and judge its morality - it has none. It told entirely on its own terms. All the main characters are career criminals and the only law enforcement office in the movie is a corrupt cop protecting a drug dealer. To watch the movie, you have to accept its terms. If you do, you will be in for an experience of a lifetime.The wedding scene at the beginning is brilliant. Slowly but surely, all the characters are introduced, while at the same time, we get bits of information on their personalities and foreshadowing of future events. Note some of the payoffs that this scene sets up. That Paulie Gatto is a traitor (\"If this was someone else's wedding). That Bonasera the undertaker will owe the Don a service, to hide his son's massacre from his wife. That the plea of Johnny Fontaine for a movie role will result in him reluctantly agreeing to perform at a casino for the family. And of course, there is the introduction of the fearsome Luca Brasi.Marlon Brando makes this movie great. Don Corleone is arguably the most famous and most imitated character in movie history. The accent, the hand gestures, the sly smile he give Solozzo are  all a credit to an acting genius.The score by Fellini composer Nino Rota is one of the creepiest and most famous in film history. It complements the film rather than overpowers it, and gives the Godfather its unique quality. Gordon Willis' cinematography can only be described as perfect.The movie ends with the famous \"baptism scene\" in which Michael renounces Satan while executing all of his enemies - the baptism is the perfect alibi. In this scene, we learn how Michael views himself - a man in perfect control over his own world, above the law of both man and God. Truly fascinating.The Godfather also contains my single favourite line in movie history, spoken by Clemenza after the murder of Paulie Gatto: \"Leave the gun. Take the canoli.\"I like Part II even more, because the plot is more involving and the flashback scenes to the rise of Vito Corleone are the best cinematic work ever (imho). Needless to say, these movies are numbers 1 & 2 on my all-time list.For me, this is a perfect motion picture. **** out of ****.", "Over Rated": "Once Upon A Time In America is a far superior movie. Francis Ford Coppola shoots his movies like asshole, but then again so do his pals Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. If Sergio Leone had directed this like he was originally asked to, it would have been great, but he didn't, he passed it by. Martin Scorcese also would have made a harder kick ass version and I don't mean more violent, I mean Just-Plain-Better. Instead you have the weak cinema of an overrated narcissist. Of course it's a decent film, but it's far from a timeless classic like the afore mentioned OUATIA. It's as dated a Dirty Harry, but you don't see that in the top ten films of all time. The greatest technical achievement made by the film makers was in the field of Special Make-up Effects, by Dick Smith. That is all.", "More like the \"Godless\" Father....": "Quite possibly the MOST over rated film in history. Never has there been so much made of so little. It is an OK movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of \"gang\" lifestyle. This movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot. Do you know what the saddest part of this movie is? That it was remade two more times with the Godfather III being quite possible the worst remake EVER. I'm not saying you won't like the movie. It is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie. I just can't stand when movies can't stand up to their own hype.", "It doesn't get any better": "I cannot add anymore superlatives to the previous comments from IMDb subscribers.  This movie is the greatest.  I read the book twice before seeing the film.  The first time for the pure enjoyment of the marvelous storyline & dialogue.  The second time to reflect on Vito and Michael Corleone's management abilities.  Are they not CEOs?The movie - it's breathtaking.  I own the entire series and watch it whenever time allows.  Unfortunately I can rarely afford the six hours necessary to do so.", "One of the Greatest stories ever told!": "What  could I possibly say that has not been said about the Godfather that has not already been said because there has not been a better film. There has been comparable films in my opinion but it is in that elite class. No other movie could excite me thinking about it, like this one, The character studies were amazing, Some of the greatest characters ever. The direction,score was Amazing. Al Pacino secured his place in history thanks to this movie, a Perfect 10, whoever said this movie was bad, I don't see how anyone could respect their opinions about anything.", "In just one word: Overrated": "Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched \"The Godfather\" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 2nd greatest movie of all times.If you have not watched this movie I invite you to do so and judge for yourself. If you have watched it already I would like for you to try and convince me that I am wrong. If you decide to do so, I would appreciate if you did it in a respectful way.Regards, MANIUIS.", "A True masterpiece": "This is more a comment on the comments then on the movie.  The movie was so well made, great story telling, great acting, and a vivid look at a time gone by in American history.  What is really funny is that reading the comments you find two or three people that say this movie was junk.  To say it is not the best of all time is one thing, I like Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia better myself, but to say that this was a bad movie is unthinkable.  But that is what makes this web site so much fun.  Everyone can voice their opinion.", "Pilgrimage of movies on 50th Anniversary": "#1 movie of all time. Absolute Absolute Best.Watched the 50th anniversary edition on a super screen and walked away (again!!) astonished.Superlative craft in every aspect of movie making.Only thought was to go home and watch the next two editions.Pilgrimage of movies starts with Godfather!!", "Old School Movie Making": "You want story? You got it. You want characters? You got it. You want intrigue and movement and music and gala? You got it. This is the template for how movies should be made. You love/hate the people. You feel their lives. You believe and cast aside doubt. You get wrapped up in the thing. This is what a movie is supposed to do.It's more than a mafia movie, it's a movie about family and loyalty, about love and determination. There is no comic relief, except Luca testing his devotion to the Don, and then tragedy. Yes, a very tragic movie but very well done. There are triumphs. There are falls. All very well mixed and very well done. Excellent work done on the costume and general set work. It draws you into the time and place, as a good movie should. No cheap shots, no pandering. Just very good cinema. Bravo.", "The Shakespearean Epic Of The Movie Generation": "How do you define a movie's greatness? For me, it's pretty straightforward; mainly the direction, the script, and the acting. And the Godfather triumphs on every level. Coppola and Puzo have created an epic tale of a powerful mafioso patriarch passing his crown down to his unwilling son, and the shift of power unfolds brilliantly with betrayal, vengeance and tragedy.Marlon Brando delivers one of the most intensive performances ever seen in film seemingly effortlessly. His calm demeanor carries along a subtly powerful and intimidating presence. Al Pacino is a revelation in his first role in a major film, displaying his range as he moves from the role of a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park, to the reluctant successor of the Don who transforms from the righteous war hero into a ruthless king. James Caan is PERFECT for the hot-headed Sonny, as is Robert Duvall as the intelligent Tom Hagen and John Cazale as the tragic figure of Fredo.I will run out of superlatives if I continue. Overall, The Godfather is a timeless classic that will always be the epitome of how a truly magnificent epic film should be.", "Apparently it's popular with its subject matter, even...": "Everything about The Godfather is brilliantly framed--well, almost. The depiction of Sicilian country life is, perhaps, a bit crass. Even so, its insular depiction of the world of Cosa Nostra was true enough to life to win the laud even of members of the criminal organisation.In the first place, \"The Godfather\" does an excellent job of weaving together the literal and metaphorical world of the mafia. Within the mafia, traditional institutions are given a warped, double meaning in which to frame illicit activity. For example, \"mafioso\" literally means, \"man of honour,\" but \"honour\" refers to a loyalty to an entirely different set of rules than those to which any Christian (or post-Christian) would consider even remotely acceptable. \"Famiglia,\" as used in Cosa Nostra, means a criminal corporation. \"Cristiano\" in the Sicilian tongue often designates not merely a Christian but any human being; to CN it signifies any ordinary man of honor. As for \"godfather,\" one mafioso standing godfather to another's son is often a formalisation of an illegal business pact.Puzo's and Coppola's Corleonesci, however, carry the double-edged sword of actually showing both meanings of these loaded words. The mafia family here IS a literal family; the men of honor, portrayed as they are in a closed word, CAN actually be viewed sympathetically as \"honourable.\" (Of course in real life most mafiosi are literally Catholics {albeit sham Catholics}.) Here, the closed world so carefully guarded through layers of command in real life is given further immunity and legitimacy by actually being what it publicly claims to be--and so much more.Little needs to be said about the performances, which are by and large stellar; the casting of Al Pacino is of course a near sure sign that the film will succeed. Perhaps Diane Keaton may not be much to look at, but she does not play a major role in this installment. Neither do the cinematography, the score, the high-level tension, etc. ad infinitum, require further laud than has already been heaped upon this film. If you haven't seen it yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Immaculate taste and Latin sophistication await, all ye primitives...", "The Best Film of All Time": "\"The Godfather\" is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so.\"The Godfather\" has it all. The cast is classic and the acting universally stellar, the shooting scenes have just the right level of intensity, the lines are all delivered with precision, the plot is enthralling, and the characters are actually interesting to watch.What is the secret to the success of this great film? That's a tough question, but it's really the fact that everything about the film is done to just the right level. It's never boring, and the plot holds plot twists, but not so many that you grow suspicious of the film.As I've said, the acting is exceptional. Obviously, Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as the likable Don Vito Corleone. However, also noteworthy is James Caan's fiery performance as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall' star-making work as the cool and collective Tom Hagen. The only shame about this movie is that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for it. His portrayal of the reluctant future godfather of the family who is eventually completely corrupted by power is pitch-perfect. The fact that Joel Grey won it instead for his clown-faced role in Cabaret is laughable and painful.The bottom line is this. \"The Godfather\" will always go down in history as the greatest film of all time, and for good reason. It's \"an offer you can't refuse.\"", "Definitely one of the best films ever made": "The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast, genius writing, and direction. Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again.", "Cinema at its finest": "This is the movie that I use as a reference for all others to understand the best elements of Film.When I mention world building, editing, cinematography, directing, atmosphere, characterization and they don't understand, I refer them to the titan of all films. The Godfather is that film.While not a horror movie, the scene with the horse head in the beginning of the film pushed me to pursuing my passion for horror films.If you want to begin watching movies as a hobby and really understand the art form, please watch the godfather. It will not dissapoint.", "The media has made it a mockery you couldn't ignore": "The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is \"is it really the greatest film of all time?\" I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be \"overrated\" and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many \"best film\" lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about \"The Doughnut Godfather,\" where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,\" we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S.

In generalmob dramas have been overrated from Godfather to the SopranosTV series.  The main problem with The Godfather is that many plotelements are not shown or even described.  The followingexample is a *spoiler* so if you don't wish to hear a fairly majorplot point don't read on.  In the middle portion of the film Sonnypicks up the phone and then goes racing off in the car with othersscrambling to follow.  He then is gunned down.  Neither the topicof the call nor the reason he was killed are told to the audience,leaving them wondering why it happens aside from the usualtension throughout the movie.  These types of skimpy explanations make too many parts unbelievable that the plot is aweakened form of a potentially great plot.  Outside of that themovie features fine acting and scenery for a decent butdisappointing experience.", "The 10...": "One of the classic movies and one of my favorites movie of all time is \"The Godfather\". It is a movie that show us how are the things in mafia from an inside look. In this movie you will understand how things work in mafia and which is the followed hierarchy. Marlon Brando made on of his best performances of his entire career as Don Vito Corleone and it seemed as he had won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1973. You will also love the performance of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (Nominated for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).\"The Godfather\" is a movie that you must see and I strongly recommend it to you and I am sure that you will rate it with a 10/10.", "LEGENDARY": "This is one of very few movies that shook the film industry !!", "By directing \"The Godfather\", American director Francis Ford Coppola has given viewers a unique opportunity of discussing Italian values in an American setting.": "When it comes to a discussion about the popularity of American cinema, it can be stated that there is hardly any American film as famous as \"The Godfather\"-a film which has caught the attention of cinema admirers all over the world. While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in \"The Godfather\" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan.

In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI).FINALLY we have a category which is fiction, but not strict fiction; being an original work which, while not being the representation of historical events, it contains fictional events that are inspired by real life occurrences.THIS is the type of storyline that makes for the best fiction; also this type is the one that makes and needs those disclaimers that appear in the either the opening or closing credits of a Feature Film or TV series episode that say something like: \"THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM/TV EPISODE ARE FICTICOUS. NO COMPARISON TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD ARE INTENDED NOR SHOULD BE INFERRED.\" TODAY'S honored/dissected film, MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER(Alfan Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1972), is perhaps the best example of an exponent of this category of Gangster Film. While we all are aware that the story is not a true one; at the same time we also note that there are many characters and occurrences in the story, both in the book and on the screen, that were clearly either suggested by real people and actual incidents or were out and out caricatures of such.READILY we can identify fictional characters in the story that were doubtless obvious make-believe versions of denizens from our real world. The main character of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) seems to be a composite character; having taken certain characteristics from both Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, New York Underworld Big-Wigs both as well as Dons of two different 'Families'. Carlo Gambino even had been known as 'the Godfather'.ANY casual gambler or vacationer recognizes that the character of Moe Green, a Las Vegas Casino Operator closely corresponds to the profile of real-life Ben \"Bugsy\" Siegel; who was both an early advocate and promoter of investing in and expanding the already existing gambling in 'Sin City'.(Ben Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty in BUGSY (Baltimore Pic./Mullholland Prod./Dessert Vision/Tri-Star, 1991, but that's another story!) QUITE POSSIBLY the most obvious connection between the factual actual and the all made-up fictional lies in that of the fictional singer. 'Johnny Fontaine' (real life singer Al Martino) has the most widely held opinion of naming 'old blue eyes'(himself), Frank Sinatra as being the leading suspect.THERE is indeed many similarities both in Mr. Martino's characterization, as well as the story's references to \"That Movie Big Shot\" and Johnny Fontaine's not getting the part in the War Picture that he wanted.* But in the novel, the singer Fontaine has a Comedian Partner! Can you say Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis? Allen & Rossi? how about Brown & Carney, Wheeler & Woolsey, Clark & McCullough, Abott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Samson & Delilah, St. Paul & Minneapolis....ON a personal note; the reported indignation expressed by some Italian-American Civic groups over NBC's premiere network broadcast of the film seemed to be less serious than originally reported; as practically every Italian we ran into that day said something like, \"Hey! The Godfather's on tonight!\" AND in summary, we admit it, we love those Gangster Pictures. Most folks do. But our only real criticism of the Film and the Puzo Novel is that they both tend to raise the status of Don Corleone to that of being something that a real Gangland Boss would not ever be. By way of a comparison, let us just say that Vito's conscientious and benevolent characterization is an extreme and a sophomoric falsehood. It rings no truer than the persona given to mythical Nevada Senator Geary(G.D.Spradlin) as a completely evil, patently dishonest & ruthless louse in THE GODFATHER, PART II, (1974).NOTE * The references are thought by many to be of Frank Sinatra's getting the part in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY over Columbia Pictures Mogul Harry Cohn's preference for Eli Wallach. Maybe, but again, maybe not.AND remember, Schultz, the answer is no about the singer character. He was Johnny Fontaine, not Frank Fontaine (Crazy Googenheim in the Joe the Bartender segment of THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (CBS, 1960's)!)", "Sophisticated and Classic": "When I think of an \"old fashioned\" Hollywood movie I think of The Godfather. Someone who does not appreciate the early makings of Cinema will not enjoy this movie and even see certain scenes as cheesy and not realistic (Ex. When Sonny is shot to death, the marriage with Michael etc.) But when you step back and look at this being something created in 1972 these events come to life you in a new way, hence the title of a \"classic\"In this movie we see the theme of loyalty to family throughout, showing the viewer the importance of sticking with those we are the closest to. We also get to look at the inside of power struggle between different family members and how people can loose respect for an entire family because of one persons actions.

First of all, I have to say that this isn't a movie for everyone. If you are easily offended by violence then you should think twice before watching it as part of your film culture. I'm not saying it should be avoided because in my opinion; it's the most perfect film ever realized. \"The Godfather\" is perfect on every aspect. The plot is intriguing, very interesting but also very disturbing and cruel at some points. But the movie displays the reality of the horrors that surround mafia and narcotraffic. It also demonstrates the consequences of display of unlimited power, connections, and how leadership is vital for taking important decisions on any level.The Godfather's importance relies on it's influence on modern culture and cinema in general. I could go on and on mentioning the most memorable scenes and not make justice to them. (Taking a breath): The headless horse, Brasi's murder, Vito's demise, Michael assassinating the turk and the captain, \"leave the gun, take the cannolli\", \"Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes\", the FINAL and almost heavenly baptism-massacre parallel situations. \"The Godfather\" is perfect. It paved the way for crime films and believe it or not, I'm sure it generated interest in mafias in the real world.The acting is superb, classic. Marlon Brandon delivers probably the most popular and outstanding performance in cinema. His portrayal as Don Vito Corleone generated a school of acting. Al Pacino plays his part with smoothness and demonstrates his cold blood in the most important family decisions. James Caan is also memorable as the wild, attracted to money son. He is the opposite side of Michael. Robert Duvall is fantastic, he is the most equilibrated character in terms of pace and emotions. Special mention to Lenny Montana for his display as the brutal cold blood bodyguard Luca Brasi and for Abe Vigoda. Also, Peter Clemenza was a key character that could only be acted by Richard Castellano. Diane Keaton was also excellent. The Direction is just amazing. Francis Ford Coppola created a sandbox where crime and politics were generated like a clockwork orange. The visuals are amazing; the Italian exteriors and the American settings make an excellent contrast on every single aspect. When I think of this movie; the first setting (the wedding) comes immediately to my mind. That is because it perfectly describes everything that's going on: negotiations, underground business, and mafia's working for their own benefit. But all these aspects just surround The Don, The Godfather. I'm amazed how all the events are important and relevant in order to deliver the final punchline. I can't praise this movie enough, what I've said, it's been said by millions of persons. But I declare myself as a die hard fan of The Godfather and I believe that \"his\" legacy will last forever.Having power has all kinds of consequences.", "A Must See...if you still haven't.": "Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children's children...if we're lucky.I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven't seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino's character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It's just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family.The fact that this movie is non clich\u00e9 makes it more enjoyable to watch. It's not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It's so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood. Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It's not the loudest and most 'vibrant' movie, but that's kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won't like any. No words and reviews can do this movie justice and i believe that unlike some over rated, inflated movies The Godfather actually deserves its big reputation of being a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. without a doubt...10/10", "the best": "This movie really made a lot of difference\nI am loving it", "Lengthy? YES! Boring? NO! Entertaining? OH YES! That's an offer I won't refuse!": "A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where \"The Turk\"(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!", "\" I'll warn you only once, don't ever go up against the family \"": "The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called \"The Godfather\" about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as \"I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse.\" A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****", "A must-watch": "It's everything I ever wanted it to be based on extremely high reviews and my expectation.The acting is incredible. The character development is fascinating to watch. Twists, turns, amazing dialogue and memorable moments.It might be long, but not at any point did I think of taking a break. Simply stunning.", "The epic film of film industry": "A must watch for all film enthusiasts and lovers. The acting, story, the direction it's extraordinary and the movie is released in 1972 that's remarkable.", "This movie is even better than the room": "Godfather is good shouldnt be rated x not even that violent\n.", "One of the Greatest Movies of all Time!!!!!!!": "Everywhere I go, everyone I talk to has heard of this film. I always thought that it was just an overrated movie and so I never decided to watch it. Until now!!! And my oh my was I impressed. I was so digressed into the film it felt like I was part of the family.And Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando. One of the best and most compelling performances I have seen in a while. He is just so... perfect. He is a gangster. The guy murders people. And yet he is the most likeable person in the whole film. I wish he was my godfather. I mean its no wonder he got an oscar!Al Pacino gives an equally fine performance as he perfectly shows his path from a heroic war hero to a ruthless crime boss. Every scene with him is just so exciting and inticing to watch especially in the restaurant scene. The tension being built from the beginning to the end gave me goosebumps.I'm am glad the main array of cast members got there deserved nominations.Watching this film 51 years after it was first released doesn't make a difference. Sound brilliant. Picture quality astounding. Not to mention the blood effects were incredibly realistic that they made me jump.Credits to the director who made this film like watching a documentary. Everything about it just feels so real.I am more than excited to watch the second one although I'm a bit sad Marlon Brando won't be there.Overall. One of the greatest films of all time and definitely a 10/10.Leon Soteriou.", "\"It's strictly business\"": "There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets \u2013 voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience \u2013 and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot \u2013 we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence \u2013 no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top.", "AMAZING!!": "Cant believe this movie is from 1970s. Its the first time i gave a movie 10/10. Easily this could be the best Movie in the history of Hollywood.", "there is a mystery about this film": "Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration. I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota's melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...  I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don't understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them). Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it.  Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying. I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.My rating for the film is 8 of 10.", "The greatest film of all time": "The Godfather is quite simply the best film of all time. The film really sets of the groundbreaking genre of mafia/gangster films. This film follows the New York mafia family in 1940's America as they try protect and build upon their empire whilst challenged by rival families. This film is filled with outstanding performances, Al Pacino plays the role of the son who is against everything the family stands for but throughout the film slowly finds himself going against everything he believed in and consequently joining their ways and eventually becoming the leader of the family after Don Corleone's life comes to an end. This film marks the start of Al Pacino's outstanding career and is still one of his best performances to this day. Marlon Brando playing the main role as Don Corleone in the film is at his very best and absolutely deserved his Academy Award for his performance. He gives a real sense of realism to the film and shows us the intelligence and pride in the mafia rather than the criminality and violence people stereotype the mafia with. John Cazale, who plays Fredo, gives the performance of a lifetime as he plays the runt of the family, lacking intelligence and bravery and will never live up to his father's aspirations for him. He always lives in the shadow of his two brothers and is seen as inferior to them throughout, Cazale shows psychological realism as we see his struggle to come to terms with his inferiority. This film portrays the Mafia in a way which we find ourselves sympathizing with the characters despite their criminal antics. Which is astonishing to see due to the severity of their crimes. Many films such as Donnie Brasco, Casino and Goodfella's have tried to replicate the outstanding way in which the mafia is portrayed in this masterpiece but no film has ever matched up.With unforgettable quotes and scenes, you will never watch a film so compelling in your life. With a mixture of outstanding acting, directing, writing and music this is an all time classic. The defining film of Francis Ford Coppola's career. The only film that could ever compare : Part II.A truly unmissable film.", "It's all business": "For mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for pleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made.", "I've seen this movie, don't want to see any other in my lifetime.": "The Best Movie of All times, Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are Superb. Al Pacino as the son of the Godfather rules the second half of the movie with its excellent histronics and style. How The ruthless Michael conquers the underworld empire is perhaps the most significant tales of ever times. GodFather II equally good but III simply disappoints.", "The Greatest Film of All Time": "I cannot stress just how perfect this film is.However,I will try.I watched this film as a fan of mafia films,so maybe I was going into it biased,but I have never been so captivated by a film,you ignore the fact it is 3 hours long.The directing is perfect,the casting is perfect,the acting is perfect...everything about this film is top class.From the hot-headed Santino(Caan),to the rational Tom (Duvall),from the reluctant Michael(Pacino) and especially the Don(Brando). These characters have such on-screen chemistry and every actor compliments their co-stars brilliantly.The film also succeeds as being one of the few gangster films to draw out such varied emotions.Anger when the Don' life is threatened-sadness when Santino dies trying to save his sister-joy when the Corleone family wipe out the competition at the end.This film has nothing wrong with it.I'm not even joking when I say you're life is a waste if you have not watched this filmEnjoy The FilmSean", "It is a classic, there is no denying": "\"The Godfather\" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1972, so this one is already almost 50 years old now, 3 to go, and it runs for almost three hours. I am not even sure if it is necessary to talk about the basics here, but lets go. The director is Francis Ford Coppola and he is also part of the writing team. This is probably still the defining mafia movie and the rating here on imdb says it all. It won Best Picture at the Oscars and Marlon Brando (in heavy makeup) received the second Oscar of his career. Add to that a writing Oscar, but the movie was cut short because of the tremendous success of Cabaret at the Oscars this year where Fosse won Director over Coppola and Grey beat all the three supporting nominees from The Godfather. I don't think Pacino was in the right category though, but I guess they really were all over Brando and wanted to make sure that nobody (from his own film) could stop him from winning. Anyway, the film starts with Brando and he is certainly defining in the first 90 minutes of the movie until an assassination attempt happens and from that moment on he moves a bit into the background and the boys take over, most of all Pacino for whom it was really a star-making performance.Now as for the plot, it is a cleanly structured film really. There is basically one affair after the next and many of these issues don't have to do a lot with the next. The movie starts at the godfather's daughter's wedding and there is not really too much focus on the actual wedding process, but instead we are taken into the world of crime right away when an old acquaintance asks a lethal favor from Don Corleone. Pretty memorable beginning really that has been spoofed in many other movies, even animated ones not too long ago. Not much later, there is of course the really famous longer sequence that results in a bloody horse head between the sheets. And they get longer and longer as next up is the key plot that involves the Turk turning into the main antagonist as he plans to kill the godfather, takes out his most brutal assistant at the same time and abducts his lawyer. And while the latter is also considered a son (not by blood), we also witness how the godfather's offspring deals with this situation in their own very unique ways: Sonny the hothead, Fredo the weakling who cannot protect his father whatsoever, Tom Hagen (the reasonable one) and eventually Mike whose role is not too clear early and who is far far away from becoming the man he turns out to be at the end of the movie. There is still more focus for him on his love relationship to his significant other and he says he is not like his family. But the attack on his father and later on the killing of one of his brothers really change everything and we find out he is just exactly like his dad. As for Hagen, I still think Duvall is really good in this movie and there is one very brief moment in this film when we hear Vito Corleone say something like somebody who is not Italian like them, which shows that Hagen is really accepted as a son and also seen as Italian pretty much, even if he is German/Irish. This would be one of the really rare funny moments, slightly funny I guess, this film has to offer. It is never about making the audience laugh admittedly, but more to witness the demise of the old man and the rise of the new star eventually and the crime and brutal murders that come with it. As for Michael, this of course also includes him losing his wife when he is in Italy. Had that murder not occurred maybe he never would have returned and the story could have taken a completely different path.I think one of this film's biggest strengths is that despite the really big quantity of characters, even for a 3-hour movie, they are all fairly memorable with their quirks, mannerisms and backgrounds. Take McCluskey for example. The movie could have done completely without him and he is really only there to serve as support for the Turk, but still he is truly memorable. Actually, his little words on how he frisked hundreds of guys like Mike for guns is another somewhat funny moment. He has no idea what's coming his way. I also want to say a few words on Fredo. He is not as big as the others in here yet or actually he is not too far away either. His scenes are all memorable and he is really definition of weakness and incompetence in 1970s cinema. Of course, that is even more the case in the sequel where he plays an absolute key character. But in this one here, he is also vital really and you could write pages alone on his character and how he (re)acts. Truly sad really Cazale died so early, but he left us a truly remarkable character and honestly every film he made was a winner basically. Now another thing to add here is that it also the small moments that count. When Mike lies to Kay at the very end, we find out 100% where his priorities are now and that he won't let anything get in the way of keeping his father's empire intact.Another strength here is that Puzo and Coppola are not scared of killing off major characters and it works oh so well because it makes a whole lot of sense. Pay attention to the permanent contrast of new/young life vs. death towards the end: When Vito dies, there is nobody around him except his very young grandson and that still puts major focus on the family component that is oh so crucial here, also when Mike talks about somebody treating Fredo badly. Or the christening of course, which is the best example with the baby and the alleged goodness vs. all the killings that take place at the same time. Vito was gone and that point already and he had gotten soft anyway, but Mike is not scared one bit about blood on his hands to defend his family's honor. Overall, this is a tremendous movie and when we see the bodyguard guy close the door eventually between Mike and Kay, it is all clear. Mike has turned into his dad by then. And how things go on, you can watch in the second film that in my opinion (thanks to Bobby) is even better than the first, even if the majority does not disagree.But yeah as for this one here, it was the third time I watched it I think and it gets better with each viewing I suppose. It is a film you don't wanna miss out on. Highly recommended, really close call between Cabaret and this one for me when it comes to 1972's finest. I'd still go with Cabaret though I think. It is just as much of a masterpiece. And finally, also pay attention to all the minor references included in here that seem even more interesting if you know how the saga continues. This is also why it is so much worth rewatching. One example would be Vito swearing on his grandchildren's well-being. There's many more. Do not miss out and girls who read this don't trust people saying this is a film that will only or mostly appeal to males. If you like quality filmmaking, then there is no way you should not watch! Oh yeah, but obviously you need to be able to stomach the violence. Just one example, there's a guy shot in the eye through his glasses and we see the blood pouring from his head and that is far from the most violent stuff depicted in here. That's all, folks. Watch it, don't be scared by the running time. You will not ask yourself afterwards if this was really worth 3 hours of your time, but if you are ready immediately for another 3 hours, namely the sequel. I was lucky enough to watch this film on the big screen and I am already looking forward to an occasion to see the second (and third). Certainly pick this opportunity over a small television or laptop screen. If necessary, wait for the 50th anniversary when it certainly will be shown again in many theaters. Mobster filmmaking at its finest.", "Emotion": "I read someone's comment saying that the movie lacked emotion. Now, I don't agree at all, I love the movie and wouldn't dare to criticise it like that. But after giving it some good thought, I can see what he or she meant with that comment. And it can be easily helped! Watch the other two as well! If you watch the three movies, preferably with no more than a day between them, you WILL feel emotion. It's a long story about people and if you allow yourself to feel for these people, when you get to know them, than you can't be left untouched. At least I personally can't imagine anyone not being touched. The story's so good, the acting is amazing, the movie is incredibly well made and the music is beautiful. So please, people, if you hated the first one, give it another try! Watch it again and watch the others as well.

Robinson etc We Love the Mob. The Godfather is nothing different. It is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. The story is a rags to riches story of a crime family that stared out with nothing then rose to the most powerful crime family. What I love more then that, Is the character development especially with Micheal from a war hero to a cold blooded boss. It is the story of a family that faces challenges from both outside and inside the family.If you haven't seen this epic. Then please do your self a favor and watch this masterpieces.

Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece.

If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot. Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film. Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long! All I can saying is that it better be more stuff going on in the movie then the first one.8.7/10 not a bad film but a few flaws", "Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema.": "The film is one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. When, after ruling for two generations, the Mafia's New York Don (Marlon Brando) dies, his youngest son (Al Pacino) takes over reluctantly, but later learns the ruthlessness and brutality required to maintain his position.The Godfather is a brilliantly-made film with all the fascination of a snake pit: a warm-hearted family saga except that the members are thieves and murderers. Its position as one of the great films of the last century is secure, in part because it works on so many levels: as a father-and-son story, as an epic account of the Mob's overt power and clandestine business empires in America; and as an apparently authentic glimpse into a closed world, with its own distinct and deadly codes of behaviour.", "Never before, never again....": "They say lighting never strikes twice and, while I hope that it isn't true in film as it isn't true in nature, I don't know that we'll ever see a movie up to the caliber of The Godfather again.

I've seen it so many times and I'm such a movie buff that I've made it my life's goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty. I've heard the runtime criticized, but there are no superfluous parts to the movie that deserve cutting. I can only hope that we someday see a film that measures up, but won't hold my breath.

The actors also do very well.The management however, although it takes well the tone, but is that to my Coppola I do not like, I am sorry, but I do not like how it directs. He can not catch me in any way. Neither with history nor with beauty, which does not exist, nor with plans. I do not like anything that is a film shot basically in the foreground. Of course it has open plans, but all the conversations are in the foreground, there is nothing staging. The character of Al Pacino seems totally inconsistent to me, as soon as it says white makes black. It is the most variable character of the whole cast.Yet this is the best of the three, because the two is worse and the three is worse still in every way.", "10/10": "Beautifully crafted film, definitely a lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers.", "Cult Classic": "An Example of Cult Classic,Simply A Mind Blower and An All Time Top Listed Movie. Al Pacino Was Amazing. The Whole Movie is One Hell of A Drama. The Whole time we looking forward to outcome. One of the Best Crime Dramas Ever. Screen Time of Every Actors were pitch perfect and The Script was just A Classic Script Itself.", "A complete crime drama must watch": "A classy story of italian crime family \"corleone\", story rolls around the family head vito corleone who is now not as powerful as used to be and so the son michael corleone jumps in the family business to bind the scattered things once again ! A complete crime drama, filled with music, classy dialouges and character that cannot be find in any other movie !", "If cinema is truly the 7th art, this will film will answer the \"what\", the \"how\" and the \"why\"": "Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can't help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years.", "The definition of epic.": "The entire scale for this movie is huge, and every scene carries emotions with it. The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?SPOILERS FOLLOW\nFirst of all, people get their hopes up so high when they see this film that, it's to the point, if it doesn't change their life it's considered to be boring and dated. But, also, people also down vote it when it threatens the popularity of their trendy LOTR flicks and other movies that make you 'cool' if you like them.Acting - Brando was so subtle and yet had such a dramatic impact on the way acting was done. I have images from this film that I remember, and mostly I remember Brando holding the cat in the opening scene. His voice has influenced modern film and television - as almost every show on television has paid homage to the father of all film. Score - The score is haunting, and somber in all aspects of the word. It builds emotional tension and it has a pay off. The main theme is amazing and is beautifully put together and is always in the right context when it shows up in the film. It's beautiful, and I strongly urge you to get the original soundtrack.Direction - Francis Ford Coppola took a very subtle and consistent approach in bringing this film to life. Think of Michael in the diner with Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo, as the train is perfectly timed in going by, before Michael (in Al Pacino's career making performance) explodes with rage. It is so apparent in his face, and we feel as he does -- nervous yet we still anticipate. Story - The script is very well written, adapted from the brutal book by the brilliant Mario Puzo. The story of the film was ahead of it's time - and it still is. While being played on television today there are still people who refuse to like this simply because it's hyped. They try to go against anything that's popular in an attempt to look cool. It doesn't work - so give me The Godfather over Pulp Fiction (and all of the hip crime film copy cats that it spawned. i.e. The Usual Suspects [which is ranked higher than ON THE WATERFRONT] -- what is wrong with our society?)\nEverything is perfect as we become immersed in the world of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and we're along for the ride as well follow him through a few years of his life. This film changed the way I saw art within movies.\nYes, I hated it the first time I watched it. But, for some reason, felt I should watch it again. On the second viewing it was confirmed; I hated it. I trashed it everywhere, including on this site, and made it sound like the worst movie ever made. Boy, how much I've grown. I trashed it because I didn't want to be caught up in the frenzy this movie has produced. It created a whole spawn of copy-cats and followers trying to capture the art as The Godfather did, and sadly, it will never happen. This will never be duplicated or surpassed in any sense. From start to finish I am completely captivated at the imagery, the music, the brilliant acting, and the underlying script that holds so much warmth, and brutality.For any true fan of film - do not hate this simply because you want to be 'different' from others and look like some sort of outsider since you went against society by not liking a great movie just to prove how original you are. Face it, you're not original - you're doing the same thing others have done when it comes to this film for years, and as I once done as well. All of these kids who hate this film will have the hip movies in their best of lists, and you can figure out their personality from reading them.Their lists will have these films on it:The Shawshank Redemption (another reason why people try to hate The Godfather; Shawshank is their favorite film and it burns them inside to see The Godfather best it in the top spot)Fight Club (hip and trendy, violent and against society. What more could an angst filled teenager want?)LOTR (The scenery is beautiful, but turning everything into some sort of contrived melodrama because the script calls for it is ridiculous; this is by no means the best film ever made. It's a flavor of the month that will die out as time goes by and people realize the acting is horrible.)Etc, etc, etc. It seems like it's cool to dislike The Godfather films because it makes you look like some sort of 'rebel.' Trust me, Spock, it doesn't make you look like you're cool; it makes you look very stupid.\nSo many people have given this film a '1' in voting. How in the fudge? The music was awful, the acting was awful, the direction was awful? I highly doubt it. Anyone with an IQ over 100 would never say this film deserves a 1.My proposal for a new IMDb rating system, based on categories.SCORE: 1-10 [1 = awful   10 = excellent] ___10___ (KEY)\n ---------------------The Godfather:Acting (leading) 10, Brando changed method acting forever and, in this role, plays the most memorable film character to ever grace the screen. His voice only deepens his enigma. Respect this man.Acting (supporting) 10. Coppola got wonderful performances out of his mostly amateur cast.Score: 10. It's at the same time haunting and beautifully done.Direction: 10 easily. This changed American films forever.Script: 10. Written with brilliance, sheer brilliance. The story is brutal, and so is this ambiguous adaptation.Replay value: 10 -- this film never lets go of me, and has my eye from the very start. I could never get bored watching the masterful acting come from every character in the movie.There, and I average it up and get my rating of: 10. ------------------2 Fast 2 Furious:Acting (leading) 4. I've seen worse, but not much worse. Words are repeated so often it feels like a cheap video game.Actor (supporting) 5. Tyrese gives needed comedy, but still needs to watch some good films.Score. 1. Awful, tries too hard to market itself towards an ignorant mainstream teen audience.Direction: 3. Some of the scenes are decently choreographed, that's about it.Script: 1. Totally forgettable. The dialogue is stagnant and brings absolutely nothing profound or new to the table.Replay value: I'd never watch the film again. It brings nothing new to the table and is stupid.Average that up. If someone gives 2 Fast 2 Furious a 10 for ACTING -- they don't deserve the pleasure of being able to relate to the majesty of the best American film ever made; yes, that's right: The Godfather.\nIf you don't like it the first time -- watch it again and force yourself to not get bored. If you make it through the second time (it's an acquired taste) think about it, think about the profound story it expresses, the emotions it throws into scene after scene after scene, inviting us to consider, and even feel, the pain they are all going through, and the love and happiness they often share with their, you guessed it, family.Don't like this movie? I'll make YOU an offer you can't refuse: a hip trendy blow-em-up-shoot-em-up flick with no moral value and no merit at its core.\nScore: perfect all down the board, this film could never be topped. To me, the only films that come close are Apocalypse Now and Rashomon (in the woods - Akira Kurosawa)But, before you trash this film -- do what I did: give it an honest chance and forget the hype. After a while you will realize the hype was there for a reason, this film is amazing and will continue to be looked at as the best film to ever be made, regardless of what anyone has to say about it. Say it's dumb, say it's long and boring, yeah yeah yeah, you've got ADD, go watch commercials. They're easy to understand and yet so informative. If anyone actually thinks this movie deserves more than a 6 in rating it is disturbed. No professional film goer (someone who has seen over 100,000 films) would EVER say this movie was horrible. Goodfellas is just a mundane rehash of everything The Godfather had already perfectly portrayed. It's a good film in its own right, but could never match The Godfather. Sure, it's hip -- let's get some of that so people will invite us to the mall so we can check out the latest ORIGINAL clothing that everyone else that's trying to be original is wearing! Oh, a shirt that says \"you laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same.\" What a wonderful paradox; there's a million cliche'd teenagers out there wearing that shirt now, thinking they're original for doing it - but yet it's a mainstream shirt that everyone has. Come on kids, watch some good films.", "One of the greatest movies of all time": "Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s. This is a must watch for any person who appreciates cinema.", "The Godfather is an amazing piece of art": "The shot of the darkness of the crime and the lightness of the family in the beginning is one of my favourite bits. Not just in Godfather, but across both of the Godfather films.\nThe anger of Sonny and that being what destroys him and the nice gentleness of Vito, and what you think is a nice college boy, Michael, becoming an evil psychopath and how Sicily is like a back in time place, and Michael becoming Godfather for his nephew and his crime family at the same time is just brilliant.\nI really can't say more.", "Godfather is to cinema what Bill Gates is to money": "Without the Godfather cinema is missing its backbone.  Often heralded as the greatest movie in history, I would not dare disagree.  This is the only flawless material this world has ever made.  The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it.  The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it.  The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor.  Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down.  It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...)  Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman).  James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both.  The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture.  This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter.  I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home).  No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema.  Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows such insight and power in leading a family I wouldn't mind letting him run America as President.  I own three copies of this movie one for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I recommend this movie for anyone who can breathe.  rating\u0011/10.  PS contact me for any more recommendations on movies, they don't call me the \"tree of knowledge\" for nothing.", "Geeky Randy's summary": "Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.**** (out of four)", "Trust me when I say this film has earned its reputation": "It's very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it's hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don't usually notice (unless they're really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can't talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn't surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself.10/10", "A True Masterpiece!": "One of the best movies of the century! Tremendous acting by the cast, the story-line is well constructed! Although, the pace of the movie can be a bit slow for young audience but overall its wonderful! All in all, one of the few movies that contains everything, action, drama, suspense, thriller, romance and full of amazing dialogues and scenes! A must watch for everyone!", "A clasic": "This movies is pure class. I only am going to say you must whach it.", "Great Movie": "The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit.The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome. 9/10", "Oh my god, we've created movie greatness or a mafia hit": "What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes \"Never personal\". He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering \"Yes\", would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it's ilk, better's it.", "Coppola's perfection": "The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole.It's a good thing they did, because I don't know of any other case where so much has come from so little. Everybody is perfectly cast, from Brando down the the most minute walk-on. No punches are pulled with bringing the book's content to the screen, the production design creates a perfect-looking world for it to take place in, the cinematography captures that world beautifully, and the score emotionally underscores it all magnificently.This truly is one of the medium's pillars.", "My favorite film of all time": "For me The Godfather is the best film. Everything from the music to acting and script are all perfect. The film has tons of amazing iconic lines and scenes and of course the character of Vito Corleone is amazing and Marlon Brando does an amazing job of playing him. Everything about the film is perfect.", "One of the greatest": "The Godfather is the film is ready to watch for me every couple months or less. Amazing on how our past existed with the best that care for their families, and people that respect them forever. Likely my favorite movie of all time.", "The best film ever.": "I'm a movie fan! I love most movies I see (except of, for example, \"Crash\"), but, this one movie, for me, has everything a movie must have.First off (and as John Travolta says in \"Swordfish\"), it has REALISM. From the girls and the boys at the wedding (all of them seems truly Italian) to the Scene when the filmmaker found he has no legs. Everything it made truly believable. ACTING. And that's not a minor factor. Everyone acts as hell, everything is so well done. Almost impossible to believe. DIRECTING. Yes, this is one of the (if not the) best directed movies. Everything's on its place. I truly love it!I can keep on naming good aspects of this wonderful movie, but truth is that I just can't explain why I watched this movie more than 50 times and still, every single Friday night we gather around the TV set to watch it again...A gem I could not afford not to share with the rest...", "The greatest movie ever made.": "Francis Ford Coppola achieved perfection on film with this great work. He directs so subtly that he makes it seem simple. But watch the subtleness of the scene outside the hospital when Michael (Al Pacino, at his best) lights the cigarette of Enzo the baker. One quick shot of Michael's hands, and they aren't shaking, and we know that he was born for the family business. The great Marlon Brando ad-libbed the films most important scene, that in the garden with his grandson, as the Don dies in peace, ironic for a man that lived such a violent life. The moody cinematography of Gordon Willis is the best ever caught on film. And the score by Nino Rota (I know the Academy didn't believe it belonged entirely to Rota, but who cares what the Academy thinks?) is a classic. The rest of the cast, which includes Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Richard Conte, John Marley and Sterling Hayden is in top form. Every film and television show about the mafia since this one has borrowed or outright stolen from this film. It is a story of profound depth, an American tragedy, told in three acts, and this, the first act, is the best. And yet at its root, it is a very simple story, as Don Corleone prepares his children for the lives they will have to live and the world they will have to live in. It can be summed up as family values, mafia style.", "Not a bad movie but definitely the most overrated.": "Definitely the most overrated movie ever. It's not bad but it's pretty slow. I've tried and failed to make it all the through it many times but I always fall asleep. Perfect example of a classic that's surviving on nostalgia. I'm sure for it's time it was revolutionary. Reminds me of when older folks talk about their favorite athletes from the past. Sure some of them are all time greats but let's be honest most of them just can't keep up with modern times. I'm 34 years old for reference in case I come off sounding like a child.", "Great": "One of the best movies i have ever watched.\nSorry, your review is too short.", "Are you kidding me?": "Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as \"Gone with the Wind\", \"Casablanca\", or \"Lawrence of Arabia\". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like \"Indiana Jones\" and \"National Treasure\" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film.", "The very best movie of all times": "I can't really describe accurately  how I feel about this movie. I have seen it so many times and every time I have enjoyed it more than the previous one. The plot, the music, the actors and actresses couldn't have played better roles.

This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks and he sees no other ways than to step in and fight for his family; if you watched Scarface and you liked Tony Montana, than you'd like Michael as well. This is a masterpiece and I think everyone would love Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone making the story so good.", "The GODFATHER": "This film shows an Italian Mafia Carleone headed by Don Vito, The Godfather. You are lucky if he is your friend, but if he is your enemy then you are dead. The film starts with his daughter's wedding introducing all other characters. Here comes our main lead Micheal who is a simple guy who doesn't want to get involved in the family business. There are other Mafia families equally powerful to Don Vito's family. One guy Sollozzo, who wants to start his drug business under the protection of Godfather. But Don Vito who is a good mafia rejects this deal as drug business is against his principles. This act of rejection starts a gang war among mafia families involving great atrocities which affects even the Corleone family. Micheal also gets involved in this war due to family emotions and other reasons. This movie is a great piece of art with great acting, action, drama and with spices of surprises.", "One of the best films I have ever seen": "Could not recommend higher. Does not matter your age, background, etc. And it is not nearly as long as I expected. Sonny as a character and James Cann performance are terrific and reason enough to watch it. Al Pacino is terrific. Duvall an Brando are great.", "The greatest mob film ever": "The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants. Marlon Brando's performance was so superb that he won an Oscar for it. I loved this movie! If you are any movie fanatic, you should see this movie before any other.", "An Offer I Can Refuse": "I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clich\u00e9s. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them.", "Definitely deserves its high rating": "I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10", "A Timeless Epic": "The Godfather has become over the years a classic and many consider it to be one of the best films ever made, this is truly deserved. Everything about the film is perfect and I simply cant think of anything that shouldn't be there as every single thing screams perfection. The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn't bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others. A true classic. 10/10", "A sprawling, epic, Mafia masterpiece": "This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed. The cast is great with Marlon Brando impressing in his oft imitated performance as Don Vito and Al Pacino doing a really fine job as Michael, a character who changes believably as events affect him. The rest of the cast, which includes James Caan, Robert Duvall. Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton are also great. Director Francis Ford Coppola does a great job bringing the story to the screen, helped by a fine soundtrack from Nino Rota. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fill fans.", "The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!": "The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.", "Okay": "The Godfather depicts Italian and American cultures accurately almost. Nothing is too Hollywoodised about this film. Characters are authentic in their actions. Which made me feel immersed. Vito Corleone is the cunning, adaptable, quietly assertive, violent, tactful, and relatively practical strategist of the Corleone family. Michael Corleone is the unpredictable, emotional, cautiously hesitant, rebellious, intense, and secretly romantic son of the Corleone family. Sonny Corleone is the simple, aggressive, straightforward, religious, popular, and loudly assertive son of the Corleone family. Connie Corleone is the pampered, very emotional, girly, materialistic, least harmful, and vulnerable daughter in Corleone family who is treated as a small instrument for the Corleone patriarchs' political game. Kay Corleone is the emotionally intelligent, protective, quiet, careful, lady-like, and religious mother of the Corleone family. Carmela Corleone is the religious, kind, fearing, traditional, emotional, and diplomatic mother of the Corleone family. Tom Hagen is the analytical, opportunistic, tactful, quietly emotional, loyal, and financially supportive lawyer of the Corleone family. Despite the hype from this film, I had an impossible time liking any of the characters in this film. Everything has a slow pace until this film's ending. The Godfather's funeral scene for the Vito has characters with so many black clothes... Also, Carmela has the wrong accent here because of slight inaccuracies.", "Perfection Has a Name.... The Godfather": "Francis Ford Capolla's The Godfather is perfect, faultless and gripping. This film will really not stop sticking you to your chair. Al Pacino's second feature film and no doubt his best. His character is lovable and thrilling.It all begins when The Godfather (Marlon Brando) is granting favours, on the day of his daughters wedding. It is a tradition, not to deny a wish. Chaos is caused and problems occur. Problems which cause his oldest son Sunny (James Caan) to take over his role temporarily. Sunny, being the aggressive and annoyed one of all the sons. Causes something else to occur. Each problem causes another. The adopted son Tommy (Robert Duvall) is a lawyer and is capable of making a small portion of the problems disappear. This movie is literally gripping, no matter how tired or annoyed you are. This will still end up being your number one favourite movie; and Al Pacino is Michael, the youngest son, and probably his fathers favourite. He gives a perfect performance. With other brilliant actors through out the film (John Cazalle, Dianne Keaton) this film is, I will say it again, perfect! I STRONGLY recommend this movie to absolutely anyone and everyone. Most probably the best work of the brilliant director Franciss Ford Capolla.I give it a 110% and an 11 out of 10.PERFECT!", "what is the big deal?": "I'm glad there are a few voices of dissent within all of the gushinghype listed here.  Do the fans of this movie rate \"Citizen Kane\" asthe 2nd best film of all time?  Then maybe listen to the Beatles andElvis Presley  as the greatest music of all time?   Is America undersome kind of cultural mass-hypnosis?  Grossly overrated on all counts.", "This timeless masterpiece slowly grows on you.": "I've stopped watching 4 different times after the first 30mins but later one day i've decided to finish it because I've never heard great things about a film like this then happened to watch I was totally mindblown and got to know why this film is undisputed inspiration for 100's of films even after 40years of its release. It's a character driven film more than a plot driven film that's why we feel unsettling while watching the first 1 hour but as long as you travel with the characters and their emotions you can feel the magic. Can't thank enough the cast and crew for this greatest cinematic experience, I wish every movie buff will check out this film to witness how a grand masterpiece can influence their work.", "One of the most iconic gangster films.": "The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families.Filmed with a much dark and eerie atmosphere, the cinematography captures the grimness and sinister elements of the gangster era, like a film-noir movie. The plot goes at a steady pace, capturing in detail the height of Don Corleone's life from his daughter getting married to the many people turning to him for advice and help in dealing with the nefarious activities occurring in their lives. The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom. But overall, it's a pretty good movie, very dramatic and sinister - perfect for crime drama movie fans.Grade B", "Awful film": "The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast.", "Solid characters with long boring sequences between memorable instances of action": "I decided to give this movie a go after seeing it in the #2 spot in the IMDB top 250 list.This movie establishes the characters well, and all of the acting in this movie seemed top notch, with even small character roles being portrayed convincingly throughout the film.Unfortunately, a large portion of the film contained long scenes that caused me to rapidly lose attention or become sleepy. The excessive amount of time (eg. The first 30 mins at the wedding) does not do well to set the pace of the film - instead lulling the audience into a dozy stupor in which many viewers would be tempted to jump on their phone.The notable parts of this movie are the parts where action happens: the tense encounter with the police chief, the scene at the boom gates, the emotional garden scene with the don/grandson. These are the noteworthy parts of the film where the cast are finally given a chance to flex their talents.Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other low reviewer's summaries when I say this movie is overrated. While it may have been a great movie in the 1970's, or even 1980's, this movie is less likely to earn a 10 star review in 2021, and more likely to give you a three hour nap on the sofa.", "Well not the greatest movie ever made...for me.": "If only this film was not supposed to be the greatest movie ever made...Had an interesting start.\nBut then it took too long for me to get invested in the characters.\nAnd it kind of tries to glorify crime and criminals.So yeah this movie needs lots of patience. Maybe when it was made it was different and trendsetter.Oh. The expectations.", "Movie , which is unparalleled .": "Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a \"Jewish Godfather\"; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an \"Oriental Godfather\"; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a \"modern day Godfather\".If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.", "it's Not Just a Movie !": "The Godfather\nIt is a very tragic and logical story that teaches you the important of something that unfortunately has lost its meaning in the present day : the familyFather (Vito) who lived alone and came as an expatriate from the city of Corleone, and the most important thing for him was the family and died among his family and the people who loved himAnd his son Michael became the leader of the mafia, but he did not care about the family, and he was inside a life dedicated to him and wanted to influence it, so his daughter paid his selfish wish and died alone in the city where his father was born, the city of CorleoneWhat the movie wants to do is not a mafia dialogue, and this is what it is, it is the film that really communicates the importance of family and this is noticeable in the difference between Michael and Vito with their familyVito: A man who does not spare time for his family is not a manMichael killed his brother and deprived his daughter of the one she loved and forbade his son from singing and lied to his wife and told her that she was doing an abortion and widowed his sisterAnd of course we do not forget the great song \"Speak Softly, Love\" is a jewel and very tragic.", "LOVED IT": "WILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIEWILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIEWILL FOR SURE WATCH AGAIN FRANCIS WAS GREAT IN THIS AND COULDNT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER MOVIE.", "Pros and cons": "Pros:\nSolid from a technical level, very serviceable camerawork\nLighting is remarkably nice in some scenes\nAction parts can be effectively brutal\nExtras are fun to watchCons:\nApproximately 100 scenes that lacked anything entertaining or worth watching\nVery little diversity in characters, the range of character writing is remarkably small\nMain plot is uninteresting, side plots go nowhere\nDeaths aren't usually given the gravity they deserve, very little reaction from characters\nToo padded for its own goodBest part: the baptism scene\nWorst part: any scene in the old country, maybe the part when his wife died and he was like whatever", "Amazing Movie": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.", "The Highest Level of Film Making": "The Godfather deserves all the love it gets with its fantastic acting, story, suspense, character development, music, and direction. This is the highest standard of film making, Francis Ford Coppola was a genius with his direction in this one and the second. This is a gangster film like no other, the perfect combination. Its like having your favorite food at your favorite restaurant in your favorite city, everything is perfect, from the front and center details to the small and minor ones.", "How a reluctant criminal becomes the Godfather": "This was the biggest grossing film in 1972 when it was released and I am told that it follows closely to the Mario Puzo novel of the same name. The movie is followed by two sequels, which at first I believed were a part of the novel, but later realised that in fact they were separate. They seem to all meld together into one epic, though I will treat them all as separate movies, though I will refer back to the previous films occasionally.In this movie (which I believe to be the best) we watch the internal and external struggles of the Corleone family and how things slowly change in the life of young Michael Corleone. Michael (Al Pachino) is the central character in the film, though the others of his family, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), Sonito Corleone (James Caan), and Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) are of importance. Looking at the cast though, there are some very competent, and surprising, actors that appear in here. In fact I was surprised to see Diane Keaton (who plays Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's wife) in the film, but then I only just recently saw it for the first time.This movie is a tale of epic proportions and we watch here how Michael changes through the events of the movie. In the background of war and violence in the streets of New York, Michael, who wants to remain distant from the criminal ways of his family, yet feeling ties of loyalty to his family, is slowly pulled into it. The turning point comes when he is in the hospital to find that all of his father's guards have vanished and he has to make a decision to remain apart from the criminal aspects of his family, or to dive in and save his father's life.I guess one of the major things here is that you are what you are. No matter how much Michael tries to deny his family's business, he cannot escape the inevitable fact that it is criminal. Even though he could simply walk away from him family, he feels loyal and devoted to him, and even though his father his a criminal, he loves him.Another interesting thing that I read was in regards to the treatment of women in the film. The film is divided into spheres: the domestic and the business sphere. In the movie all of the women are in the domestic sphere and are not allowed to enter into the business sphere. The movie also details violence towards women to force them into that domestic role. We have the woman that is talked about at the beginning who is violently violated and the man seeking justice. We have the young Corrie who is married at the beginning, kept away from the family business, and beaten up when she refuses to work in the domestic sphere. We have Michael's first wife who is learning to drive, only to be blown up when she starts the car and finally there is Kay Adams, who at the end of the movie is shut out of the business end of the family, after being lied to by Michael.The movie also deals with respect, in a little bit. At the beginning, Marlon Brando gives a monologue regarding how the man petitioning him only comes to him when he is in trouble, and is never treating him as a friend or even a Godfather. It is not that he does not want to help him, but that he would like to be a friend to the man as opposed to somebody who is only visited when there is trouble.This movie is epic in proportions, but it is too detailed in places. It is long, and even though some long movies, such as Thin Red Line, are good despite their length, others are simply way too long to really want to sit down and watch. In fact, it took me a while to actually sit and watch these movies because of their length.", "It's still as fresh and still as enthralling even now.": "Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify: a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead \u0096 there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression. It is the getting under the skin of a lifestyle that we watch, the emotional and natural progression of a family, only difference being that this family are a New York based Mafia organisation but with an equally fascinating tale to tell.", "BeatlesFan3287 Reviews \"The Godfather\"": "When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time.", "The Godfather was a very compelling film to watch though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time": "After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s.", "MASTERPIECE - Best Movie of All Time": "The Godfather is the best movie of all time because this movie got the most splendid crew. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo, the author of the book \"The Godfather\" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of movies, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Pacino's raspy pseudo- whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.", "THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies...": "THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies is an understatement for the line 'THE GODFATHER of all movies'. You won't miss any element of a great movie in this. Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now.", "Quantity Does Not Equal Quality": "I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of \"terrible\", with 5 being \"mediocre\" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)", "Leave The Gun - Take The Cannolis": "In 1940's New York, Vito Corleone is the head of a powerful organised crime syndicate, but he is ageing, rival gangs are vying for control and the new racket - narcotics - offends him. Fiercely protective of his family and business interests, what does his future hold ?For me, this is the ultimate revivalist picture - nobody had made a gangster movie for ten years and from out of nowhere Coppola made this stunning, sweeping, moody and evocative classic which not only smashed box-office records but became (and still is) the definitive gangster film. Aside from the incredible style, what appeals to me most is the grand tragedy of the movie; although he's a crook, we can't help but admire Vito's world-weary pragmatism, moral code and love for his children, and shiver at Michael's descent from innocent to avenger to cold-blooded killer. Vito's acute sense of failure, particularly in the garden scene, is as heart-wrenching as any of the (memorable) action or suspense scenes. The whole movie is a catalogue of stunning sequences though - the opulent wedding-party, the horse's-head-in-the-bed, the deserted hospital (my favourite), Sonny's bullet-ridden death on the causeway, the assassination in the cafe, the final montage intercut with the christening - all simply breathtaking. The performances are sensational, with many great little bits by the lower-order players (Marley as the bigoted studio boss, Lettieri as the kingpin, Castellano as the cheery Clemenza, Montana as the unfortunate Luca Brasi), but for me, Brando is the heart of this film. He's not my favourite actor - he's a bit pretentious in his angry young man roles and totally loopy in his later ones (see The Missouri Breaks), but this is a masterful performance. He makes the Godfather both real and mythical, simultaneously open-hearted and enigmatic; a rare lead role of a thoughtful old man who, despite all of his courage, power and intelligence, the world ultimately passes by. It's a sensational piece of acting. His line, \"I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those bigshots.\", sums up both his character and the genius of Coppola. The richness of this universal theme is beautifully enhanced by Nino Rota's gorgeous, melancholic score, and the sheer quality of the amazing imagery. This is an incredible tapestry of a picture; an unprecedented critical and commercial success, the grandfather of all movie-brat blockbusters, the most influential crime story ever filmed and an unmissable treat for all connoisseurs of great cinema. Scripted by Coppola and Mario Puzo, from Puzo's bestselling novel. My two favourite pieces of trivia - the writers censored the word mafia from the screenplay, and the baby in the christening sequence is the director's daughter and respected filmmaker in her own right, Sofia Coppola.", "Stands the Test of Time": "I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays!", "Disappointing": "After all the hype people have given this movie and the fact it won Best Picture confuses me.Most of it was just people sitting around talking. There were some good actiony scenes but they are few and far between, aside from Sonny's sister flipping her lid and smashing up the house, followed by the famous tollbooth scene a few minutes later.Speaking of the house-smashing scene, it's meant to be dramatic but I burst out laughing, but that's just my morbid sense of humor.Maybe I'm just not \"getting it\" and my head is up where the sun doesn't shine, but this movie was just...... kinda boring for me.", "BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here It is the review from Parts 1-2-3 together)": "Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word \"perfection\"? Well, \"The Godfather\" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely \"perfect\" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the \"American Dream\"; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes \"The Godfather\", the strongest brand of cinema till today10/10", "The only film I'd call flawless.": "There is no movie quite like The Godfather. It was the movie that gave me a true respect for film and motivated me to seek out something else over those few family friendly flicks I'd see twice a year at the theater. Now I watch nearly a hundred every year and yet I've never found anything quite like this masterpiece.\nIt's the type you can watch over and over again and somehow find new things that make you respect the film even more. It's really an experience to watch and everyone should see it at some point in their lives.", "The irony of being pretentious.": "There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of \"BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME\". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions\u2014Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others\u2014but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for\u2014the horse\u2014but beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly clich\u00e9-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.Perhaps it was very influential in cinema\u2014why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious \"film buffs\" claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? \"CLASSIC\" is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather\u2014other than the generic \"good plot, good acting, etc.\"\u2014is considered so great is, \"BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP.\" Maybe what they're really trying to say is, \"I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it.\" 4/10", "Look how they massacred my boy": "They massacred my boy. Its a little bit overrated. But overall \u00e6 good movie", "It is one of the top ten ever made!": "I was surprised looking at my voting history that I had not voted for this one before. Though not my number one it is one of the top ten ever made. The acting is outstanding. Young Pacino was at his very best. I don't want to start naming the actors, because all of them put in their best performance. Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented. The scene with the horse in the producers bed is gruesome, but the subjects are of that caliber. It is one of those movies that has to be seen at least once if for no other reason than because it truly is one of the best films ever made.", "\"In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.\"": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people (even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable! Overall rating: 10 out of 10.", "One of the best films ever made!": "The first Godfather movie may be over 43 years old but still holds up well after all of these years. The film is at heart a story of family. It is the story of Vito Corleone and his three sons, Santino (Sonny), Frederico (Fredo), and Michael. It is also the story of Vito's other family, the mafia. The story focuses on Michael, the youngest son. At first, he wants nothing to do with the family business but as the film progresses, he is drawn more and more into it and by the end, he is running the family - both families. The transformation of Michael from family outcast to Godfather is fascinating to see. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of transforming from playful young man to fearsome gangster. Without going into too much detail so as not to ruin the movie for those few who have never seen it, several scenes stand out: The horses head is probably the most famous, or infamous, and has been used in homage and parody by many others in the years since the movie was released. When I rank the best movies I have seen, the original Godfather is always number one on my list.", "A deep and thought provoking film": "I must admit it wasn't until the second time I saw this film I realised just how flawless it really is.However, what really struck me the second time was just how psychologically deep the movie really is, particularly in respect to the number of symbolic moments used throughout.For instance, note the turning points in the film following Michaels visit to the hospital.  Whilst standing vigil with a nervous (!) friend of his fathers on the hospital steps he lights the other man's cigarette.  He seems to be taken back either by just how relaxed HE is or possibly something more deeper comparing the opening/closing of the lighter to the motion made by the trigger of a gun.Also note a moment shortly after this, following a punch he receives from a corrupt policeman, leaving him with a swollen jaw.  Michael Corleone sits amongst family and friends plotting the murder of two threats to the family business.  He is calm and calculated in his plotting, and even physically resembles his father (swollen jawed).How many other levels does this film go?", "Okay maybe its a bit overrated, but its still an amazing movie!(might contain some spoilers)": "Rated R for Strong Violence,Sexual Content and Some Language.

It's very long, but it's seriously an amazing crime tale guaranteed to keep you absorbed. However, some audiences will certainly ask what elements are placed throughout this 70s drama to collect such extraordinary fame.Well the talented Al Pacino delivers a simply phenomenal performance in this love letter to fans of crime classics, executing the son of the head of a Mafia family who is provided with his father's role. All the other actors and actresses are stunning, too. Another factor of the film that's entirely unthinkable for someone to dislike is definitely the classical soundtrack and theme. A lot of credit needs to belong to Nino Rota, who intelligently wrote the stylish music.But wait, there's much more! Obviously the stunning visuals are loveable and so are the onscreen actions, but behind the camera, Francis Ford Coppola is responsible for the direction. Plus even though you've probably heard it more than a billion times, The Godfather is incredibly entertaining and a must-watch for Mafia movie lovers. See this masterpiece in the cinema with popcorn, in which you'll sense its effect all around you. But prepare yourself for the nearly-3-hour runtime, because it isn't quick.

You could have seen them when they first came out or your children's children can be viewing them, and they will still give the same long lasting impression. They may encourage you/your children to get into film or entertainment, they make you think. They keep you talking well after you've seen the film not once, not twice, but for a long time. There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films.I was too young to see it once it came out, but I read alot of movie magazines at the time about it as well as grabbing a copy of the Mario Puzio book. My first full length view of \"The Godfather\" was on...yep, you guessed it, the \"Z\" channel in Los Angeles in the 1980's. It grabbed me and never let go.The Godfather has everything in it that a movie going public would like to see, and the rare thing is -- it's all in one movie. It deals with family, the relationship of sons and their placement IN a family, it has violence -- that's for sure, mystery, romance, corruption, suspense. It has a story, surprises. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery and sets are wonderful.This was 1972 and NOTHING like this was put together/filmed at the time. The early 70's gave alot of film makers chances, some good, some spectacular -- and most of all a legend for future film makers and entertainers to look at, hold in esteem and copy (which is the best form of flattery.)Don't get me wrong, there are many 'gangster-type' films out there that kick-butt (thanks to James Cagney, Edward G. and a host of others) , but this one...flowed. It really isn't all about the violence, but legacies, how violence begats violence and a look inside a \"family\" maternal and extended and what they would do to survive. The rivalries between \"families\". This is why \"The Godfather\" ranks in the top 7 of the best movies of all time among the majority. Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert DuVall and an ecclectic, well cast group of actors and actresses and Production crew brought this to life. Regardless of how YOU may feel personally about the \"portrayal\" of the ethnicity of the characters, this film MAKES you wonder, makes you feel, makes you angry, makes you cry, makes you respond.The Godfather is one of the best films ever made.", "Epic": "Great film, great sound track (score).

His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi.

Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.I have never read the novel but I am sure I will pick it up.

Al Pacino gave an astounding performance as Michael Corleone and it is this film that made him my favourite actor.

Now that i saw it again a bit older i truly understand why this is touted as probably the best film ever.Nothing i could write hasnt already been written before, but when the only flaw i can find in this movie is a bad overdub - \"I talked to Barzini!\" - then this truly is a cinematic masterpiece.", "A dark world sprinkled with moments of beauty.": "It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece.", "I think it's Overrated film": "Not worth to present in top 10 Popular Movie, yesss i know it's Impossible to ignore the performance and evaluation of characters via marlon Brandon and Al pacino Both are Incredible actors, but the long period of movie is boring, there is a lot of Scenes Not important.", "The greatest film of the 20th Century": "This film has everything - Great actors at the top of their game, a brilliant and realistic story, a top director, brilliant cinematography, wonderfully evocative post war costumes and cars, brilliant scenes (horses head, restaurant shooting scene, hospital scene etc.) and a score that adds to the film without overpowering it. At first look it would seem to be a film about a family of gangsters, but I think that what it really is is a story of how a good, intelligent man, a war hero, can become a monster by degrees. Godfather II is probably superior but it couldn't have been made without this film. A true masterpiece.", "Foundation of a gangster role model.": "Story about a man, who is a gangster, and his relationship with family, encounters, businesses and many more. Nevertheless, despite being filmed fairly long ago, the movie is genuinely enjoyable and has very few boring parts.", "Do not keep high expectations from this one": "The only good thing about the movie was its style. It is unique. The second thing was Al Pacino, I mean he just holds everything still while he speaks. REally commendable performance. The opening scene was fantastic\"I believe in America\" perfectly lit shot. After that everything is a drag. I get bored by the end of the movie. It has elongated scenes , I mean these so elongated that you can take a nap without missing anything. It was more like a opera kind of movie. So the opera lovers may like this movie but for me it was boring. Go watch it if you kind of love family drama said in a kind of some song and well love to nourish the scenes", "Best Mob Movie of all time, Not even close.": "Marlon Brando gives one of the best performances of all time along with Al Pachino in this mob thriller about family and the ones you love.Everything in this movie is clearly perfect and is at no point boring, each scene flows into the next perfectly.When someone asks you what your favourite scene is it's pretty much impossible to choose a wrong answer because there are so many of them - the baptism scene, the bathroom scene, the hospital scene, the opening scene etc.Coppola released straight bangers for years after this and is easily one the best directors of all time.The way this film sets up the sequel is flawless too, leading to another near perfect film about the Mob.Top 5 films of all time. 10/10.", "Terrible, Junk Film": "\"The Godfather\" is a 'terrible' film.It's 'the worst' movie I've seen in a decade. The acting in this film is 'excruciatingly painful'. The whole family are 'watered down Sopranos' who show some phenomenally strong 'lack of' chemistry. The 'boring' weeding scene is the 'highlight'.Michael is a 'wet fish' and his relationship with Kay is very dumb, and also 'stupid' and 'weird'. The Godfather scenes make me 'sick' and 'woozy'. I haven't seen such dramatized 'try to be cool' dialogue since \"Any Given Sunday\".Pacino was less wooden in \"Gigli\". That other film he also 'carried'. Both Puzo and Brest were largely let down thanks to this 'Tony Montana' The characters of Sonny and Fredo were so 'unrealistic' I thought they were 'comic book'. I must also highly criticize the music in this film as being 'childish' and sometimes often 'out of place'.Now on to some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'silly'. If it was supposed to be nail-biting, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the actors delivered their lines was 'uninspiring'. Brando in particular 'sucked'. What about the 'long' and 'tired' Sicily scenes? Reference to four hours of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" I don't know? The car exploding was so 'unoriginal' and 'clich\u00e9d'. And the 'take over' cross baptism montage. Come on, do some CGI instead! Bah, 'armatures'.How this is ranked above that masterpiece \"Muriel's Wedding\" stumps me. If they had replaced the old and tired Francis Ford with the more youthful Nicolas they might have hit pay dirt.", "Superby acted and directed film. One of the all time greats.": "'The Godfather' remains compelling viewing after all these years. Directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola, the film shows the control of a mafia family passing from Marlon Brando to his reluctant son Al Pacino. The opening segment is brilliant as it introduces all the main characters. The acting is superb across the board with Brando winning a richly deserved Best Actor Oscar for his highly nuanced portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. Pacino gives an understated performance with sudden intense outbursts. The film is very violent but remains hugely influential. One of the all time greats.Overall 10/10", "\"The Godfather\" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time.": "\"The Godfather\" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time. The film tells the story of the Corleone crime family, and the struggles they face in maintaining power and loyalty within their ranks. The themes of family, power, and betrayal are woven seamlessly into the plot, creating a truly engaging and emotionally resonant experience.The acting in the film is outstanding, with Marlon Brando delivering a powerful and iconic performance as patriarch Vito Corleone. The supporting cast, including Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, are all equally impressive.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful, with a keen sense of pacing and a strong attention to detail. He creates a rich and immersive world that draws the viewer in and keeps them engaged throughout. The score by Nino Rota is hauntingly beautiful and adds to the film's overall atmosphere.The film's cinematography, production design, and special effects are all top-notch, creating a sense of realism that further immerses the viewer in the story.

With its strong themes, outstanding acting, masterful direction, and stunning technical aspects, it is truly a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time and continues to resonate with audiences today.", "sad, dark film": "I find it troubling that this is apparently a popular movie. The characters are all bad people - immoral, completely lost. Are we supposed to like them? I'm shaking my head thinking about it. It's also pretty slow. Lots of slow, quiet talk punctuated by random violence. If this is your sort of thing, well . . seek help. At least it's not propaganda like a Disney movie, or most Hollywood movies today for that matter.", "Greatest film yet made": "BAR NONE! As of now, this film is the greatest film ever made. I'm sure something will eventually surpass it, but it'll really take a spectacular movie to do it. This film has it all - an extremely powerful, believable story, an all-star cast and a director (Francis Ford Coppola) who made the effort and took the time to do it right! The story is of a Mafia family in the 30's through the 60's and the events that catapult a son into control of the family's empire. Al Pacino, in particular, did a fantastic job as Michael Corleone, son of his father, although he didn't intend it to be that way. There is a lot of violence, but it's not there for violence's sake. The world of organized crime was much more violent in the past than it seems to be now and the violence is depicted as more or less just a part of doing business. This is perhaps Marlon Brando's greatest performance (as the father) ever. Other great actors include James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. This is one of the best-cast films I've ever seen. I intend to always own a copy of this film!", "Quite possibly the greatest motion picture ever made": "The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a \"movie\" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen. You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family. The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another. Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.\"I never listened to the big shots holding all the strings. But I hoped that someday you would be the one holding on the strings.\"", "This film is the definition of classic.": "Although many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, the way Coppola presented the Corleone family , and his portrayal of mobsters as characters of considerable psychological depth and complexity was something new.This film is the definition of classic. There are countless movies that in their script are mentioning ...this one! That says a lot.It affect movies, TV series, books, comics, animations, even video games.The dark drama and the struggle...the pain actually.Anyway you don't wanna miss this one and IMO it is better if you see the complete trilogy one after the other.", "One of the top 10 greatest American films of all time": "Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece tells the saga of the Corleone family. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of one of the five mafia families. With his son Sonny (James Caan) and lawyer/adviser Tom (Robert Duvall) he runs the family. But the heads of the other families see the Don as too powerful and out of date with the times. They want to get into drug trafficking and the Don wants none of that. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the Don's other son who has returned from the military. This film is great on every level. The acting, characterizations, dialog and visuals are all perfectly done. For one film to have such a great performance as Brando gives as the Don is one thing. But for the same film to have a second great performance (Pacino's Michael Corleone) is unheard of. Virtually everyone in this film gives an outstanding performance.This film is #3 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list, right after Citizen Kane and Casablanca.", "Even this movie's goofs were great": "We all know what a wonderful movie this is. I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film.", "An enduring classic": "Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top 100), `The Godfather' brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.  America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this film takes us inside `the family' like never before.The script is nearly flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.However, the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.Though this was more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out, namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding. Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See `On The Waterfront', `A Streetcar Named Desire', or `Mutiny On The Bounty'), yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other families.Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.Other standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming character with a strong sense of family loyalty.This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It is an utterly perfect 10.", "Awesome Movie - Hats off !!!!!!!": "Well, I have seen a lot of movies in past, and will watch even more in the future. But, this one movie will always fascinate me.I don't know whether its it story or what? I think it's his characters. Every character in the movie, right from, Sonny to Michael has its own impact.The hero of the movie for me, was Godfather, himself and not Michael.What I like most about GF, was that he was not like we have seen Gunshots in other and most of movies. He was calm and was much like a business tycoon. He was humble and respectful.The story turns out that how a man, who wasn't and didn't want to get into all that mafia stuff, get into, for his father and family.The film doesn't have a great story, but it has grip and aura, which fascinates the viewer.", "Epic gangster saga": "Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an elegant, epic and thrilling work, to a large extent worthy of all its praise.The cast is very impressive and everyone is doing a good job. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is iconic even though I find his overly coarse voice and stuffed cheeks borderline comical. Perhaps the best thing about The Godfather is that, even though the characters are involved in some questionable activities, they aren't really made out to be bad guys; you keep cheering for the Corleones almost no matter what they do. Some people might use this as criticism but I think it is rather refreshing.Finally, the film is so well crafted in almost every aspect; the sound (particularly in the scene where Michael Corleone kills Sollozzo and McCluskey but also Nino Rota's score, of course), the cinematography (there are some stunning shots) and the aforementioned acting is all top notch. And yet, I think it falls a bit short of a masterpiece even though I have very few complaints. Perhaps it is a bit like with other classic works of art such as Stairway to Heaven and Mona Lisa; The Godfather has been so quoted and praised that it is hard to be completely blown away by it. Nevertheless, it is a solid and unforgettable film that should leave few people disappointed.", "It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great!!!": "Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug- trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisers Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels", "Best movie of all time.": "Truly, a flawless masterpiece; and quite possibly, ranking with Citizen Kane, the best movie of all time. I've seen this movie at least 20 times, and feel the need to watch it every six months (along with Godfather Part II...compared to the first two, Godfather Part III is lousy). The cast is simply incredible, particularly Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden, and the actors playing Jack Woltz and Luca Brazi.Best scene: Vito Corleone (Brando) grabbing Johnny Fontane, when the latter tears-up, sniffling, \"Oh Godfather, I don't know what to do; I don't know what to do--SNIFF\". To which Vito grabs Johnny, slaps him in the face, and screams, \"YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN!!!! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!!!? IS THIS WHAT YOU LEARN IN Hollywood???!! HOW TO CRY LIKE A WOMAN??? (mockingly) UHHHECHHEUHH!!! GODFATHER WHAT COULD I DO, WHAT COULD I DO??! What is this nonsense?\"", "It stands the test of time": "I was happy to see this on one of the cable channels the other day and we watched it. There was nothing dated about it. There we no special effects, no cookie cutter acts and scenes. It was a relief.A friend of mine, whose father left home when my friend was a little boy, adopted The Godfather as his missing dad. He watched it 25 times and quoted it throughout his life as the voice of a loving father who takes care of business. In a way it is scary, but also an amazing thing, that a film can raise a man.This movie has held the number one spot on my top ten list for most of my adult life. Western culture will remember it like we remember the works of Verdi, Rembrant and Shakespeare.Coppola can make all the wine he wants. He's earned it.", "all movies should be made like this one": "Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to.But a good movie is not only a good actor. The whole cast, the plot, the dialogs, the scenes and last but not least the director - Coppola are all near perfect. I thank GOD for bringing such talent to Hollywood as Brando and Coppola. Al Pacino is good but under Brando's brilliance his color did fade away a bit.The supporting actor - Robert Duval is also a superb actor. Even in this cold and bloody killing movie he brings warmth of family friendship, loyalty and cool-headedness to the audience and making this movie this much more gripping.The weight of a first-class movie is apparent starting from the first few scenes of the movie and lasted throughout the movie. Coppola knows how to grab audiences and move them up and down through the plot of the movie - a true master.It is hard to compare Coppola with Lucas. They are both wonderful directors of different classes of movies. But I believe Coppola can better bring depth and intricate emotions to audience than Luca. This makes him a more memorable director even after we all pass on.", "Take a look at the accomplishment of a masterpiece": "Godfather is a one of a kind film. Nothing can ever beat this kind of story, with the Mafia and organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film. Watch it, and be sure to watch the second one also.", "Greatness": "Yes, it is perfect. Every praise you hear about it is true. When every aspect of making a film is top-notch, you get the absolute movie. I would like to note though, Godfather is NOT a movie to watch while eating your pizza. It needs you to be completely devoted to it.", "Movie Review Profits": "Play The Godfather! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!", "Excellent!": "This movie is really amazing, it is quite long but it is well worked the whole way through. The story is continuously a work of art that never stops. I really love the performance of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, they are truly both well suited for this types of movies. No wonder that Al Pacino is doing the characters he does. I would recommend this movie to all ages. Even though the movie is about mafia and murderers, I would say it still okay to watch for a younger audience since the material is not that bloody. The best part is that there are two more movies to see after you have finished this one. I love these movies, the surroundings, clothing and atmosphere is just amazing.", "Godfather Review": "Overall an awesome movie. Acting was great the motion picture was awesome and the story line is amazing in itself!", "Good movie... but I have seen better.": "THE GODFATHERA long time ago I started to watch these movies and got about an hour into The Godfather and was really bored so I turned it off... until now.I liked it... but it was long! I'm pretty sure it could have been shrunk down to 2 hours.There are some really good scenes in this movie. The hits that are made on various people were really well done for it's time. Don't get me wrong, you could see the blood wasn't real, but back when this was made i am pretty sure they didn't have the effects and make up we have now.The story was really good, but it was a very slow paced movie. It took a while for the movie to get going. There is a lot of dialogue and if you listen to it properly and get into the movie you will enjoy it.The Corleone family is a family you don't want to mess with. They take no prisoners. If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion. But I can understand why this is a classic. This was probably the first big gangster film.I loved the soundtrack too... the theme to this film is legendary. I have listened to it a lot. Slash plays it on guitar really well at his concerts.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A good movie, but a mission to watch due to the length. I will be watching The Godfather Part II very soon.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204", "Like the perfect meal": "I first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college, during a summer school class I was taking called \"Literature and Film.\"  This was the second film they showed, I think, and from the moment the character of Bonasera comes on and says, \"I believe in America,\" this had me hooked. This is like the perfect meal, where all the ingredients come together - theme (gangsters as a metaphor for society, family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics), story, acting (Brando seemed a little overrated when I first saw it, but that's because he's not on-screen a whole lot; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue (\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\") - and leave you completely satisfied.  And the scene I remember is not the horse's head, or the scene where Michael says he will kill Sollozzo and McClusky, but rather the baptism scene, which haunted me for days.  Incredible as it may seem, Part II is even better.  But I'll say more about that in those comments.", "Wow (Good Wow)!": "I really don't know how else to summarize the review of such a perfect movie.\"The Godfather\" is undoubtedly my favorite legitimate, serious attempt at film-making. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction enhances performances from such top-quality actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and more.It is a violent, tense masterpiece, a movie in the small pantheon with \"Alexander\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (as well as the remainder of its own trilogy) that can hold your attention for three or more hours and never skew boring. If you're still unsure, pay attention to the squibs. Or the brilliantly natural production design. Or Gordon Willis's imaginative cinematography.Still not convinced? Just listen to this: it's much better than the book. \"The Godfather,\" while very brutal, is probably the greatest American cinematic masterpiece. And if you won't believe this reviewer, believe the people who exalted this film to a 9.1, making it the IMDb's highest-rated film. It is one of few movies on the Top 250 that deserves such a position.", "What are you people thinking????": "I noticed that this was the best rated film in this place a couple of months ago, so naturally, I decided to give it at shot. But I just don't get what attracts you folks to it?The character-draving is pretty weak, and you don't really get to go inside the heads of the gangsters. The pictures are pretty ordinary and the whole storyline is... well... boring.I mean no disrespect or anything, but maybe this is to old folks, what the first King Kong film was to my great granfather... Maybe I'm just part of a next generation... Or maybe.. A next step in the evolution. A superman! A mastermind! Maybe I'm going to be king of the hill! Top of the heap! Maybe I need to find some sleep.Sorry. This one did nothing for me, but if you're high on gangsters, this is definitly the one for you.6/10.I'd love to hear from you folks that thinks this is Gods gift to movies.", "Grossly and undeservingly overrated!": "I watched the DVD recently because everyone seems to be hyped about this 'greatest movie on earth'!! Well, I wouldn't waste your valuable time any further writing a lot here after wasting my good 3 hours watching so called God Father. I nearly died of boredom. Simply, this is one of the most boring, longest movies I have ever watched. And it is horrible! Is it a great story? No. Is it a great movie? NOT AT ALL!! It is just a welded work of so many boring, long celluloid pieces together. There is no stature, depth, matter or even an exciting plot. After all, Brando is a good actor but not that great in this one for sure. And I am still at a loss to understand why people give this rut 9.2!! It would of course be totally right just without the 9!", "the best movie I have ever seen": "The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow Min out of paper cartons.\"The Godfather\" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whisper, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although \"The Godfather\" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of \"The Godfather\" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garroting.", "Over rated is an understatement": "I saw this film when it first came out. The book was a wildly popular best seller and everyone seemed to have read it. Trying to watch it the other day on TV I can't imagine anyone being able to follow it. Too many characters, too many subplots, and a very slow pace. I've been watching films my whole life, and frankly I can't tell a good screenplay from a good performance from a good director. I do know that if I like the plot and the story engages me I'll be sure to like the movie. In the Godfather, scenes and characters come and go with no discernable point. I believe it's a lack of continuity or flow. Brando calls in Luca Brasi to keep an eye on someone. Luca is then seen in a small apartment in sideview getting dressed and then packing his gun. Then we see him go into a bar or restaurant that we've never seen before. In a flash there's a knife in his hand and a wire around his throat. Apparently the character was introduced for the soul purpose of getting murdered. Pacino and Annie Hall are having a meal in what looks like a hotel. She has the most impossible hair style I've ever seen in any movie bar none. They seem to be saying good bye and next we see Pacino walking down a street and into a dark building that we've never seen before. He seems to get agitated and notices that in one room a half eaten sandwich on the table and the other rooms seem deserted. Running up and down corridors we now have no idea where he is or what he's doing. Suddenly he opens a door to what looks like a apartment and we see Brando lying on a hospital bed. Out of nowhere a nurse appears. The audience has no clue that this was a hospital. All it would take was a sign saying Emergency Room or Surgery. Then to involve the plot suddenly a dozen police cars appear in front of the building. The Captain says he was the one who told the guards and detectives to leave. And now he shows up with more. And all this is just a plot devise to have Pacino shoot him and the other mobster.\nThere are countless meetings in this film that could have easily taken place over the phone.\nThe cars, the costumes, and the scenes all seem very accurate. But this film is like an endless dramatic story without end. Doesn't it remind you too much of the ending in Apocolypse Now with the same director years later?", "The best mafia movie": "The great cast and the spectacular acting made this movie one of the best in the history. It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. \"The Godfather\" is my favorite film of all time. It is absolutely legendary. This film, redefined the gangster genre. \"The Godfather\" is a cinematic masterpiece. Everything about this movie is perfect. The performances are absolutely pristine. Marlon Brando gives the best performance of all time, in my opinion, as Don Vito Corleone. I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined.", "Groundhog Day >>>>>>>>>> The Godfather": "Everyone's saying this overrated film is one of \"the greatest films of all time\" - NOPE! I'm saying it's Groundhog Day!WHY?? Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching \"the Godfather\", I feel, \"No, I don't want to do or watch these things\".Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT \"flawless\" - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you!I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a \"masterpiece\", and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the \"Godfather\" series should be given instead towards \"Groundhog Day\"; all the awards given to the \"Godfather\" series should be instead towards \"Groundhog Day\". It's THAT good! Please check it out!And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters.Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be.Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all.But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up.2/10PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see.", "A great film, though not as great as some will say.": "The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history.Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time.The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs.So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made.8.5/10", "The Godfather of movies": "I was very late to see this one. But once I watched I got to know \"Why\" it's the Best . Actually it should be at the top.The music, writing, screenplay , dialogue everything is so perfect.\nI don't know few people say part-1 is better than the other two parts but for me all three parts were best as per the story was going, no doubt first godfather has some supreme actors that's the real fact that makes 1st part a bit edge to win.", "Mind blowing drama, a must see": "Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks\u2014\"they are animals anyway.\"This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life\u2014marriages, baptisms, family feasts\u2014become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.", "The Godfather indeed!": "As much as I would like to do justice for this movie - there is little I can say that will help people understand the grandeur of this film. The Godfather sends you through a riveting journey into the life of one of the five great families. And with a cast as breathtakingly awe-inspiring as this, you are bound to be on the edge of your seat from the very first wedding scene.The plot of the movie is in itself fantastic, but it should not go unmentioned how it is not only a good movie - but a very realistic depiction of the harsh life of the criminal organizations, and their internal structure based mostly on nepotism.The soundtrack (which is too often ignored as an important aspect of storytelling in these reviews) by Nino Rota perfectly underlines the true sadness of this intricate storyline.", "snooze": "Before i fell asleep i was extremely bored. couldn't tell you what the plot is whatsoever.", "This was an Awesome movie which i ever watched in my life": "First time i saw this movie i did not understand the actual realty of movie and characters acting was speech less. Rest i can said when i saw and understand this movie after my 5th 100% successful attempt to watch full movie then i realize this was the awesome movie i need to buy original, and well be in my personal collection . Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless. We all knows we well not again see to like this kind of level of movie in any decades hats off to all super actors in the movie.", "Why??": "This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can't even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time. From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don's friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy? Why do they kill all the time at all? And where is the police I was wondering all the film. Lots and lots of murders, no police. Hm. It's nothing more than a bad 70's Mafia-trash-film.", "Overlong, And Perhaps Less Vital Then It Once Was": "I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir.", "Way overrated, perhaps one of the most overrated films of all time": "I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film.One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those \"american\" cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one.", "An offer you cant refuse": "This movie for good reason is regarded along with its sequel (which I think is a better film) as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. The mark it has left on society, especially the male psyche can never be underestimated or for that matter fully gauged. All actors turn in career defining performances and the overall \"feel\" of the movie is such that you feel for characters that in reality you would have every right to loathe. Not much can be written that has not already been said so just a quick reminder for that person out there who has not yet seen or heard of the Godfather to rent out an absolute classic.", "Acting powerhouse": "As a young cinephile I am amazed that there is a movie like this one.Never seen such amazing acting done by Legend Marlon Brando \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25.My favourite is Al Pacino\u26a1\u26a1\u26a1 as Michael Corleone.That transformation from a simpleton to a beast\ud83d\udc9f\ud83d\udc9f\ud83d\udc9f\ud83d\udc9f", "Family Business": "This movies are very dark i think.

Movie has telling every little word or every looking have meaning.If you decide wrong decision it can be killed you. Families are important, relationships have to be meaningful and, who have the power and strong he will survive.And the little note , my father has to dubbing this film on Turkey:)", "Movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.": "If there was one valuable and simple lesson that I learned from watching \"The Godfather\".  I learned that movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.This film was based on the unforgettable novel by the late Mario Puzo and it was wonderfully adapted into the story that was written by Puzo himself and Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film.The film is like the book itself, it's extraordinary and respects the subject that it focuses on.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are terrific in their roles and there are several scenes that left me both surprised and in awe.  Some of the violent moments aren't only graphic, but very grizzly as well.  The baptism massacre, one scene where Sonny (James Caan) is setup and is shot up like a piece of Swiss cheese, and another scene where Vito (Brando) is shot in public and Fredo (the late John Cazale) can't even shoot the two hoodlums best illustrate how ugly living in the Mob can get.Besides the other film that was directed by Coppola (\"Apocolyspe Now\") that I deeply cherish, this film has a great supporting cast and I've mentioned a few of those key actors.Even Coppola's daughter, Sofia, who would later star in the third \"Godfather\" film and have also directed her first film (\"The Virgin Suicides\"), is unbilled as the baby that is baptised in the church before the unpleasant massacre starts.", "Simply put its a masterpiece": "One of the greatest stories ever told through film. From the cinematography to the cast there isn't a single flaw.The performance by Marlon Brando is just stunning and Al Pacino amazes with his talent with this being one of his first movies. The legacy of this movie and the way it has affected cinema cant be described in words. Being a fan of organized crime movies I can say that this is my absolute favorite and I cant remember how many times I have watched it.It might be a bit long but It never ceases to amaze the viewer with its brilliant dialogue and excellent cinematography.I would like to thank personally everyone who worked on this achievement of a film. A must see for everyone who has even the slightest appreciation for cinema!!!", "9.2???? I don't think so! PERFECT 10": "Greatest movie of all time no doubt. Perfect 10. Every aspect of this masterpiece is exceptional, starting from the cast and screenplay up until the production.", "Very-well made but -shock- it's all a tad dull": "I really like the movie that was temporarily #1 - \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". I agree with a lot of what's in the charts though think some films here are over-rated. And this is what I felt about \"The Godfather\". It's very well made, etc. but it's also a bit boring.On a production level, it's hard to fault \"The Godfather\" and Coppola's handling of events. There's an intense level of detail, as he charts the rise of Vito Corleone to prominence, and the lengths people go to attain power. The direction is great - there's a real sense of epic-ness here. The city and times seem alive before you. There's a great sense of realism - helped, for example, by the use of speaking Italian in the movies because - hey Hollywood - not everyone would want to, or choose to, constantly speak English. It's rich and lush and has a quality nearly all films lack nowadays in their haste to please the lowest-common-denominator.The acting is spot on. In fact it's probably above that. It's excellent. Pacino is at his height here - wonderful as the naive Michael Corleone who has to learn the family trade. Marlon Brando's \"Vito Corleone\" has become so infamous that seeing him is almost like watching a caricature (as are many of the lines) but he's on fine form, though I preferred his fresher, more engaging role in \"On the Waterfront\".And yet for all the unquestionable production values and acting... I found it all a tad dull. I don't have an aversion to the genre - \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Sopranos\" are superb - but I found the pacing slow, almost monotonous in places. There is an attention to detail, and an epic scope, but that doesn't necessarily translate to interesting viewing. \"Lawrence of Arabia\" dragged me into the sweeping sands, yet I wasn't dragged in here to anything approaching the same degree. There's character development but, as we touch up and down upon certain moments in the lives of the Corleones, we're never given any sense of more fluid developments. We see their actions from a distance and find it harder to empathise or care about them. It all adds up to a muted viewing experience for me, and I felt indifferent to his hailed classic.I can't knock \"The Godfather\" too much, because it has a lot going for it. As one reviewer commented it, even those who don't like it feel forced to rate it highly because they must acknowledge the craftsmanship here. For all that I was quite disappointed by this movie and can only give it 8/10 (and that's because of the talent involved). The \"sequel\" was better, but not by much. Not deserving of #1 in my opinion.", "Has not aged well": "This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making.Some of the film is amazing, but mostly it goes on and on. It is very long, with some of the scenes taking an age, without really adding to the atmosphere or the point. These are not impressive pauses, silences, looks, stares, or useful dwelling time, simply editing that never happened.This film is worth seeing as a history lesson in film, to get an understanding of the development of the genre, but anybody who has seen goodfellas, casino, or any other mob flick is unlikely to find the moral tale worth the journey.", "Overrated to the extent that perhaps makes me underrate it": "This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays.", "The best film ever": "Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a \"family\" of New York who is happy because Connie (Talia Shire), his daughter, married Carlo (Gianni Russo). But during the party, Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto) is seen in the Don Corleone office asking for \"justice,\" revenge actually against gang members, who brutally beat his daughter because she had refused to have sex to preserve the honor. Vito discusses, but the arguments of the Bonasera sensitize and he promises that the men who abused Bonasera's daughter will not be killed because she was not, but will be severely punished. That's the best film of history, a lot of people don't lie. Vito but makes it clear that it can call Bonasera some day to return the \"favor\". Outside, in the middle of the party, is the third son of Vito, Michael (Al Pacino), a very decorated Navy captain who just returned from the 2nd World War. University educated, sensitive and perceptive, he is hardly noticed by most of those present, except for a college girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who has Italian descent but he loves. However there is someone who is well noted, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), a singer of romantic ballads that causes screams of the young people who border on hysteria. Don Corleone already had helped him when Johnny was still in early career and was bound by a contract with the leader of a great band, but Johnny took off career and he wanted to do a solo career. To be his godfather Vito went to see the leader of the band and offered $ 10,000 to let Johnny go, but had refused the request. Just take the pieces of this master piece, like unforgivable actuation, bring proud to family and power. Still hope that one day came a film that compare with this. A realistic and chocking picture of as mafia do their job at 40's. A master piece of incalculable value. Marlon Brando has a perfect actuation, leaving a stone in the cinema as the most respectable and acclaimed character by the public and critics.", "If Perfection was a Movie": "One of the most perfect films of all time. This movie is a must watch and a must watch again. It captures society in the mafia era in the United States. The main thematic conflict is between good and evil and the decent to the dark side for the main character Michael. The movie has a great dichotomy between the purity of religion and crime. Francis Ford Copolla has directed a master piece in this first of the trilogy.", "Schmaltzy family epic": "This is a movie for people who want to watch fat guys eat pasta.\"The Godfather\" confuses sentiment with emotion and nostalgia with authenticity. Like \"Goodfellas\", it tries to capture something deep and meaningful about loyalty, family, and honor, but in the end manages only to convey that food plays an important role in Italian culture. Brando's portrayal of Corleone becomes farcical as his brooding look tips over into a vacant stare.In all fairness this is not an altogether bad movie, but it pales in comparison to the novel by Mario Puzo and deserves to be taken down a notch.Watch this for the costumes.", "One of History's Most Overrated Movies, Which Is Actually a Soap Opera": "Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don't wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss.", "A Bit Dated, But Still Engaging": "The movie follows the rise (or fall, depending on your perspective) of the son of a crime family boss.It's a relatively enjoyable long a drawn out movie. Though it moves at a fairly slow pace, it keeps the viewer engaged. I can see why it is so beloved - it features carefully crafted characters with detailed character arcs. However, I don't find it as engaging, or re-watchable, as contemporary films.It's worth a watch, after all, it's consider on of the pinnacles of movie making, but I can't say it's for everyone.", "Violence, Violence and more Violence": "A ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes.  After about 20 minutes of this tripe I wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them -- for the good of humanity.  With few exceptions (Pacino) the acting was also of low caliber.  All the money spent on the sets, costumes, and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storyline.", "A real masterpiece": "The acting and story telling is so powerful thanks to the teaming of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his novel).  Marlon Brando is the Oscar-winning titled patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, who struggles to keep his family together.  Oscar-nominated Al Pacino is the son Michael, who eventually takes his father's place.  Let's not forget the supporting performances of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire. This is a really perfect movie about the mafia that does everything in their power to stay on top.  Not to be missed, but if you can't say anything nice about \"The Godfather,\" then don't say anything at all.  My evaluation: **** out of ****.", "The quintessential mobster film": "The Godfather is a movie about gangsters. But more importantly, it's a film about gangsters that are also real people, with real relatives and family. The Godfather has all the makings of brilliant movie.The casting is classic with Marlon Brando's unforgettable interpretation of Vito Corleone and the level-headed and dark character of Michael, played by Al Pacino also in the film's two sequels. Aside from great characters the story, pacing and structure of the film has been designed in a way, that even after 2 hours of watching the same movie you still don't feel exhausted like you would with the 2+ hour epics of Peter Jackson.The movie is also incorrectly said to be dark and gory. Certainly the darkness is warranted, but the gore is set in the film rather sparingly and I would reckon the gore in the two later films much more disturbing, even if it's not as extensive. The violence is here to remind of us of the gritty reality of the film's world and it works in a same way as the great family-celebrations bring out the happier and lighter side of the life of a gangster.On all levels The Godfather is a brilliant picture. It's brilliantly acted, cast, directed and written. It is a movie with an old-timesy feel that feels fresh each time you watch it.", "Utterly brilliant!": "This is probably one of the most nearly perfect films ever made. A dark and twisted version of the \"immigrant to America makes good\" story is wonderfully presented. No small amount of credit for the quality of this movie should go to Mario Puzo's original novel. That novel helped make terms like \"make your bones\" and \"have a sit-down\" and \"capos\" popular. Francis Ford Coppola likes to dump on the whole \"gynecological repair job\" section of the novel but that seems like petty griping compared with the way that book gave him a can't-miss blueprint for the film. Coppola's change of the closing ceremony to a baptism instead of a confirmation was inspired but for the most part the book is so closely followed Puzo practically deserved a co-director credit.This film proved you don't need constant footage of guns blazing to make a successful and memorable gangster movie. The fact that it nicely retains the source material's sub-text ensured its greatness.", "My favorite movie": "Spoiler WARNINGTelevision takes a pretty bad rap.  It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses.  Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families.  I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced.  I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional' today; my father didn't talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away.  If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright' would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary.  Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other.  We watched and we talked.\nSo when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather' I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I'm the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV.  Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive.  Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.\nEven though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special.  And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired.  Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased.  It is the cr\u00e8me de le cr\u00e8me of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times.  It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole.  It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.\nThough a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story.  It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity.  It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy.  And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America', is its exordium.  With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.\nWhat follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision.  The motif of personal rectitude vis-\u00e0-vis societal ethos pervades the film.  The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.\nThe actors are at their best.  Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict.  It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us.  Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.\nIf you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work.   At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes.  The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay's face, overcome with the realization of her husband's duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos.  Did I mention that I love this ending?  In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels.  I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will.  Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.\n`The Godfather' is a film that must be watched numerous times to absorb and appreciate the many names, nuances, and instances.  I highly recommend it.", "Perfect !": "Francis Ford Coppola's version of the Mario Puzo best seller is simply perfect. It is without a doubt the best American Film of all time. If you have never seen The Godfather, and you appreciate great movies, then go out and purchase it. This movie should not even be available for rent because it should be in everyone's movie library. This is a movie with the most ultimate character development. Each scene makes the next one better. The restaurant scene was one of the most tense scenes in cinema history. This isn't just a gangster film; it's a film about cause and effect, what would, could and should be. It's action scenes are a bit dated now, but the directing was masterful here. In my opinion, it's better than the sequel.", "My Favourite Movie": "I love Al Pacino Movie. The Godfather is the world's greatest movie and Marlon Brando was great actor I love his acting and Soundtrack is so great and beautiful.", "This movie is strong": "This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent amusement, and over the top commanding. It's hard to fine a movie done this well, it's 29 times old and has progressed well. Indeed if the bystander doesn't like cabal type of pictures, he or she'll watch the entire film, the cult is fused to what will be next as the film progresses.

Yes the movie is long but packs in itself a plethora of epic performances. The main role was tailored-made for Marlon Brandon. What this movie is and will always be is far Micheal.. a star that was bone from this movie. Al Pacino's character Michael is immortal and sets the screen on fire whenever is walks into the frame.If you love cinema, watch it.. watch it again and again and again.. Glory Glory Godfather!", "Solid movie that has aged well": "Unlike a lot of older movies, The Godfather is packed with action and plot. The plot moves at lightening speed - honestly my only critique is that it moves TOO fast! Great characters, interesting plot, lots of action. While there is a small amount of racism and the entire movie is male focused, The Godfather holds up relatively well for its age.", "A towering masterpiece in cinematic history.": "It is sort of disheartening to read the plethora of negative reviews of this film on IMDb. There seems to be a fundamental gap between those who understand and appreciate the history and the evolution of cinema and those whose powers of perception and attention spans have been impaired by mind-numbing video games and by a culture of total immersion in the utter banality of \"social media.\" I even read one negative review which seriously attempted to draw a comparison between \"The Godfather\" and the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. I loved both movies by the way, but FOR CHRISSAKES! It's apples and oranges! One of those movies was a thoughtful, introspective ADULT film, which are few and far between. The other film, though great entertainment, was not.The acting (across the board), the script (almost entirely Coppola's) and directing (entirely Coppola's) in the \"The Godfather,\" though arguably equaled on occasion, have never been bested by any Hollywood or independent film. One qualification here: to the amazement of every film critic and everyone else alive in the 20th Century, the movie \"The Godfather\" was actually eclipsed by \"The Godfather, Part II,\" which really needs to be seen back-to-back with \"The Godfather\" in order to fully appreciate either film. The two films in combination are really just the 1st and 2nd halves of Mario Puzo's pulp fiction book, entitled \"The Godfather.\" Coppola's screenplay elevated Puzo's 2nd-rate prose immeasurably, and together those two films constitute the single greatest piece of epic-scale movie-making in the history of American cinema.", "Best of '72 & Superb Brando!": "Francis Coppola's best film that deserved more than it's 3 Oscars (especially with CABARET winning 8 that year). James Caan is feisty, belligerent and passionate as Sonny, Al Pacino is introspective and brooding as young Michael, John Cazale is awkward and insecure as Fredo, Robert Duvall in quietly intelligent,and Brando kicks butt in one of his finest characters. A wonderful supporting cast, especially Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire and Richard Castellano.Nobody expected much from this adaptation of Mario Puzo's pulp novel, but it was worth all the trouble Francis went through (hiring Brando and Pacino, not filming in St. Louis..etc.etc). Brilliant cinematography by the \"Prince of Darkness\" Gordon Willis, great music by Nino Rota, and a great family American tale of loyalty, business, and capitalism. A 10 out of 10!", "A pure masterpiece": "\"The Godfather\" was a great film in every sense of the word. I loved it because it was so believable and everything that was done was most likely true. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan were excellent in their roles. Brando's voice, Pacino's youthful look, Duvall's innocence, and Caan's brutality all drew me in and it never bored me.In only his third film role of his long and brilliant film career, I saw Al Pacino's attitude gradually change for the worst. First Pacino was the war hero, then he gets into the Corleone family business he becomes a changed man and starts to climb the ladder in the family business.\nI also saw the innocence of a young looking Robert Duvall that I felt compelling and most interesting to watch. Also, the way that all the scenes of violence were orchestrated I could tell it was accurate or Francis Ford Coppola and the rest of his crew spent time researching the accuracy and made it as close to accurate as possible. Everything about this film was disturbing and that is what made it so darn good because it was so true. As great as the \"Godfather\" series was, the first \"Godfather\" could have stood on its own without making sequels. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it. I also plan to rent the following two parts at a later date so I could soak this first part in. Nine hours of \"The Godfather\" is a lot to take in at one time so enjoy this wonderful epic, but over time.", "My Favorite Movie": "If there is one movie that I can say have touched me more than any other I would have to say The Godfather has. It is more than just a movie to me. It is a movie that I will never grow tired of, and will never forget. I enjoy movies like Casino, and Goodfellas, but they can't compare to The Godfather, but to me The Godfather isn't just some mob movie. It is a flawless masterpiece of family and the life of crime. Each actor seems perfect for his role. The Baptism scene is one the greatest scenes in the whole movie. I don't know  how to make this review flashy or stand out, but all I can say is that if you are a movie lover, and are easily touched by movies then you will love The Godfather whether you like Mob movies or not. Just a classic.", "An Unquestionable Masterpiece.": "Vito Corleone. He is the Don of the notorious Corleone crime family and has ruled among the other 5 families of crime. When the Don is critically wounded in a mob hit, Vito's only son who hasn't gotten into the business begins to take over.A very in-depth, masterfully told saga of the mafia with an all-star cast: Marlon Brando as The wise Vito, Al Pacino the innocent son who loses his innocence inside business, James Caan the hot headed brother of Pacino who wants his sister to be safe, Robert Duvall the half brother atourney who looks out from all the financial angles. These and many other fine actors create the perfect cast for such a fantastic movie.The film excels in everything.

It's definitely a great movie, that hasn't lost any of it's brilliance.  The problems of Don Vito's life are still strong today, especially the issue of drugs.  Marlon Brando gives an Oscar-winning performance as the patriarch of a Mafia family, Don Vito Corleone.  There are also incredible performances by Al Pacino and James Caan, who play Corleone's two sons, Michael and Sonny. Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), \"The Godfather\" has become a staple in my house.  I think it's a movie that everyone should see, and I think many people will agree. Therefore, I give this flawless work a 10.", "The Godfather is An Offer No Audience Can Refuse!": "The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather constructs a sprawling family saga that tells the story of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the spider at the center of a web of deceit, murder and larceny. When the Don is left incapacitated by an attempted assassination from a rival crime family, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence and it is left up to his sons - the hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted Irish son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino) - to run the Corleone clan. Hardened by the reprisals taken against his family, the 'white-sheep' son Michael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare, which hints at the beginning of his moral descent. Thus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by death's hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions. But, underneath all the slayings and sinister \"offers you can't refuse\" this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honor.The Godfather has a richly operatic feel to it, thanks to the solemn and stately classicism that Francis Ford Coppola brings to his pulpy material. He doesn't waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. The artistry of Coppola combined with Gordon Willis' spot-on cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score covers many scenes in a deep veil of shadow, ensconcing the audience in an atmosphere of unconditional involvement.Each performance is a vignette that fits exquisitely into the whole picture. The character of Vito exhibits the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a staggering mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Brando's restrained motions and rasping speech patterns are stunningly suggestive of power while his actions (courtesy of the script) wield it. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. As Vito's hesitant son, Pacino rises to the occasion admirably. He beautifully underplays Michael's evolution from returning war hero to the new head of the Corleone family. Caan, gives a splendid portrayal as the hot-headed Sonny while Robert Duvall is steadily efficient as Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton is just right as Michael's oblivious love Kay.The Godfather will continue to hold a central place in cinema history, an epic which has colored everything made subsequently with its imagery and operatic scope. An enduring masterpiece!", "a bunch of Italians mumble to each other while dealing with daddy issues": "forced to sit through this \u0448it so many times by idiots extolling its virtues. i wish it was never made. I'm sick of mafia films and this dross started it all, moody, violent, miserable, and as intelligent as football and drinking. too many idiots today actually believe they are mafia because they sell some pot, or bought a dog that they beat until it turned nasty. grow up and bin this film. wooden acting throughout this title has set the bar for gangster films, and of course gangsters are not known for flair or intelligence when a beating or a bullet appears to cure all ills. the film is not a pleasure to watch, nor could i be less interested in the story of this mediocre family squabble. OK so this is my least favourite genre but it set that level. i urge anyone who hates this film to review it here and bring it down in the rankings to a reasonable 1-3 because the 10/10 that thousands of morons gave this is unreal.", "The reason why we should go to cinema and watch films": "\"The Godfather\" is flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. This is the best role Al Pacino ever played, and he didn't win best actor. The only negative thing i could say i have against the film. Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940's, in this well- respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.", "Simply a Masterpiece.": "It's a great film in the history of film. Such a well sculpted film- making. Must watch to experience the true art of film. What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a \"MUST SEE\" movie don't miss it.", "Fantastic acting and cinematography": "This movie, about the aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty in postwar New York City who transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant youngest son, brings fantastic qualities when it comes to the acting and the cinematography. Very realistic and stunning! The general life and relationships of the characters felt so real, and the production design was perfect. Can't avoid to mention the action and its practical effects. Very professional! I had a nice time watching this, but my main critic is the pace and the length. It was sometimes bland and boring, because I think there were too many scenes, or some of them too long. Some scenes could have been deleted or shortened without making any major differences on the movie. Anyway, a good movie overall, and therefore recommended!", "One of the greatest films ever made": "The Godfather is the one of the greatest films ever made. I've watch it so many times.", "still no mention of the mafia!": "with the passing of Marlon Brando I decided to once again view this film that garnered so much interest in the early 70s and beyond. I cant believe how young the lead players were! Brando looked older then however, necessary for proper plot development and atmosphere. I finally understood the manouvering that happens related to the criminal wars that take place twice during the film, once when don corleone has an attempt on his life and then again as michael asserts his influence.I read the book which was better than the movie but only marginally. Im not sure I would vote it best of all those on file with IMDb but I cant think of an alternative. being 'best' is such an arbitrary thing anyway; best in what category? best overall? what criteria? what year? it truly is a remarkable movie though, classic performances and a very tight storyline with some memorable lines and scenes. its no wonder that Al Pacino's career never looked back after this performance.it may or may not be the best movie ever made but it should certainly be required viewing by anyone contemplating a career in the mob. or in law enforcement or film-making or Italian cuisine for that matter.one thing I am sure of, if ever humans reach the stars (pun intended) this will be one piece of entertainment that goes with them.9.999 / 10", "A true masterpiece (spoilers)": "From the wedding scene, the \"I Believe in America\" speech, and the horses' head in the bed, there has not been a better film.  While you may think this designation is undeserved, you would be wrong.  Few movies have slipped into society like this one has. The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.  We get to know all the characters, from Don Vito Coreleone (Marlon Brando, in a masterful performance) to his sons, Michael (Al Pacion), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). \n  Several scenes from this movie will remain in your mind for quite a while. Marlon Brando's wheezing death, The baptism sequence cut in with several murders.  The beginning wedding sequence, and the ending.  The dialogue is perfect, thanks to an incredible script by Mario Puzo and CoppolaEverything about this film is on target.  Nino Rota's beautiful score is one of the best, with the \"Love Theme\" ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.  Though Marlon Brando won the award, it is really Al Pacino who is the lead actor, and deserved the best actor Oscar.  James Caan also finds the right note as the aggressive, impulsive Sonny.  The cinematography and art direction are perfect.  And all this comes down to Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction.  There is no way Bob Fosse deserved the Oscar over Coppola.\n  Is this film better than Citizen Kane?  Tough to say. Both were ground-breaking classics that utilized new technical and narrative techniques.  I would have to say yes, because the story here, about loyalty, family and honor, had more impact on me than the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane.", "Not the God of films": "I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill.", "\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\"": "The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence. The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather. Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him. Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years. But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen.

Brilliant performance by Marlon Brando.Also, heard about the trickery with the Dark Knight from a German and this movie deserves justice.", "Best movie I've ever watched and unfortunately probably ever will watch.": "I've never seen a movie that can move me the way the Godfather could. Crime movies try so hard to attain what the godfather did but fail miserably. Unfortunately in the day and age of remakes and sequels I don't see any movie ever topping this again.", "Movie of legends.": "It's one of those movies that I watch over and over again over the years. It is a masterpiece that even the new generation prefers to watch. Marlon Brando Al Pacino James Caan Performances are amazing.", "Classic and perfect": "I cant imagine this masterpiece made in 1972 its sooo good from the actors to the soundtrack to the twists to the mafia feel to the ending every thing was made by genius even it was old movie if you watched it you will fell its like in 2010 it was ahead of its time", "A Perfect 10": "THE GODFATHER is an example of how stories change over the years. In Washington Irving's LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, we had the headless horseman. In Mario Puzo's GODFATHER, we had the headless horse.In all seriousness, there is only one other movie I have given a perfect 10 to so far, and that's TORA TORA TORA. It took me a while to appreciate this movie. The first time I saw GODFATHER, I saw more blood and gore than I remember ever seeing in any movie before, though it's pretty tame by today's standards. My mind wandered quite a bit during it and I came out of there kind of glad it was over. Then, several months later, I heard the soundtrack and I liked it so much, I thought I would give this movie another chance. It has come to be my all time favorite movie. And the music is still great. The mellow, folklike soundtrack provides a nice balance to the violence that goes on throughout the movie.Francis Ford Coppola is faithful to the book and tells the story very well. Watching the way certain scenes are set up is like watching the workings of a fine Swiss watch, it is that good. It gives depth and insight into the workings of the Mafia that no other movie before or since ever has. The point of view this story is told in is controversial, ie, they give you possible justifications for some of the things they do, and it almost makes you sympathize with the characters. The most telling lines in the story is when Michael comes back after hiding out in Sicily for the murder of a police officer and a bigshot in a rival family. He is talking to Kay, telling her he has decided to go into business with his father, and tells her that his father is no different than anyone else who is responsible for people's welfare, like a Congressman or President. Kay states that is naive because Congressmen and Presidents don't have people killed. Michael then fixes her with that patented stare (Al Pacino was perfect in this role) and says, \"Who's being naive, Kay?\" That is a very chilling moment, as is Michael's transformation from wholesome American war hero to the head of one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Another telling moment is when Michael meets with his father in the garden and they are discussing business strategies, and the Don says, \"I don't apologize for my life. I did what I had to to protect my family, and I refused to be a fool for those pezzanovante who were holding the strings.\" In conclusion, you will have a tough time convincing me that there is a Mafia movie anywhere that is better than THE GODFATHER. 10 out of 10.", "He made us a movie we couldn't refuse!": "This movie is questionably the best ever made. It's in my top five (at #4). #4 my seem a little high, but Scorsese slid into #1, #2, and #3. Anyway, this movie was fantastic. Francis Ford Coppala has made the most memorable movie in movie history. That's a croc that Pacino didn't get best supporting actor, or Coppala getting best director. Oh well. There's not a whole lot else to say, great plot, great acting, great character development, great movie! 10/10", "What is the appeal of grand failure?": "I really don't understand people sometimes.  Here we have the #1 rated movie on the list.  An extremely famous film.  A well made film in it's own right. But the story.  It's AWFUL.This is a story about a man how starts off as a fine upstanding citizen, a soldier, no less, and his gradual change into what I can only describe as a Total S**t.I really did NOT like this movie.  I did like it up to a point...once I realized that Michael was not going to overcome his demons.\nI really don't feel I should waste any more time on this film, so I won't.", "Not my fav genre, but still enjoyable. The ability to build climax is intense.": "Let me start with what I didn't like about it. I know this is a personal preference, but I think the main storyline was too basic for me i.e. X does something to Y. Then Y gets X back. The X's friend gets Y back. And basically repeat that formula. The only thing that really changed was the methods of the attacks. And for this reason, I don't feel the need to watch part 2 / 3. But if you like this genre, then I can see why you would enjoy this movie.Pros:+ Great depiction of organised crime during that era.\n+ The ability to build tension was top tier. If I was rating it solely on this, it's probably the most on the edge of my seat that I've been during a movie.\n+ Loved all the characters & character development was great.\n+ Fab acting.", "visual wine": "My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that \"you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film.\" At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea : the rationalizing of murder by calling it \"business, not personal\", which is appalling.I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets : the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in. To my mind, the Godfather is probably the best compromise we've yet seen between art and commerce.", "Its No Wonder Why This Made Two Sequels": "This is a visual epic with grand performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando's \"Banana Mouth Trick\" is one of the most imitated characters in movie history. Also, its stars Robert DuVall, James Caan and Al Pacino in oscar winning roles. Francis Ford Coppola directs, with relative Sofia putting in an uncredited performance. The acting is solid, the story is brilliant, and the direction is superb. Although this is true, I actually preferred the second sequel. This is probably because of Andy Garcia's incredible performance as Vinnie Corleone. The Godfather Trilogy is Hollywood's greatest films. Do not miss any of them. They are true gems. Rating=4/5", "One of the greatest film ever, not just a good film but inspired follow up classics": "It is very difficult to talk about this film as a film. It is the beginning of in institution of gangSTAR films. Scarface has it going on but this is beautiful artisty combining actors that were Oscar winners and actors who went on to win Oscars! Al Pachino was incredible in depiction of a dark Amrerican come Sicillian... Marlon Brando was inspiring and I think made it very hard for Bob DeNero to measure up to. James Caan was very good and even the support characters were so well written and acted out it was brilliant! Along with this the music was also very good with the mix of Italian and American Swing. I loved it!", "Literally, A Masterpiece!": "Truth be told, The Godfather doesn't need a review. Without undue emphasis, Francis Ford Coppola's direction, Brando's and Pacino's performances are literally flawless.  The first time I watched \"The Godfather\", I was a child and it was the most astonishing film I'd ever seen. Due to my introversion, I was spending too much leisure time in front of TV, and consequently I watched many films during my childhood. However, I can hardly remember those films. But The Godfather isn't one of them. I remember The Godfather as if I watched it yesterday. The Godfather made me experience feelings of admiration. There is almost no film that has 3 hours running time and didn't bore me. But The Godfather was a breathtaking film for me. I admire Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for reducing the thick, best-selling book to the controllable screenplay which anticipated the expectations of the millions who had already read the book. For me, the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters. Seeing 'The Godfather' is still one of the biggest milestones of the film industry 46 years after its release confirms the film's status as an outdated masterpiece. Whenever I see it, it becomes better and impeccable.", "Highly overrated": "This movie is a great piece of work no doubt about that. The acting is natural, the direction is good and cinematography even better. When they say that every frame is a painting...they mean it. And the brilliantly exicuted deaths of whoever dies in this movie.\nBut\nThe problem is that it didn't match the hype for me.\nIt was suggested to Me by my friend and he said that this was the best movie he had ever saw. As he had seen a lot of movies I decided to watch this movie. This movie is boring in some parts and not completely interesting throughout. I finished this movie in 5 sittings. The scenes are unnecessarily dragged for no reason at all.\nAnd I tried hard to really root for the characters which didn't happen in my case.\nThe bgm is great.....but to use the same bgm again and again got me irritated.Overall great movie but highly overrated and boring", "Simply The Best Film Of All Time.": "It feels a bit redundant reviewing arguably the greatest and most well-known Hollywood film nearly 50 years after it's release, but I feel like I need to pay homage to this true masterpiece of American cinematic art. This is not simply a movie: this is a cultural touchstone, a landmark of human achievement, and a beautiful work of art realized by one of the few true masters of filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola. THE GODFATHER comes as close to perfection as any film ever could. The directing, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, set design, etc. etc. etc. are all world-class and I've never seen a film do better. Marlon Brando is stunningly brilliant as Vito Corleone, the aging head of a New York crime family; I only wish he had more screen time. Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable and tragic performances ever put to film as Michael Corleone, the reluctant heir to the throne. The supporting cast all give remarkable performances without exception; but Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale stand out the most. This is one you'll want to watch again and again, especially if you love classic auteur filmmaking. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, I both envy and pity you! A true MUST WATCH if there ever was one.", "The perfect mobster movie and much more": "The Godfather is a film of undeniable triumph; everything from the set to the sound and lighting, the score to the amazing cast, is perfect and Francis Ford Coppola's vision does justice to Mario Puzo's stylish crime novel, with the author partnering with Coppola on the screenplay. The film is a masterpiece of acting and direction, with Coppola's influence clear, and the work of stars such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall centre-stage in a beautifully dark and corrupt tale of a powerful Italian crime family. Never has the Mafia been better depicted in cinema, and I opine never will it be again.", "Italian mafia": "It is quite different from ordinary mafia movie. Of cause there are a few bloody scenes in the movie. But that is not the main point. The all time classic aimed at family life. That makes the mafia movie full of humanity. Although they are mafia, they are still human beings. They also cherish family though the way for protecting family is violent. That is the most attractive place for the movie.As to the director Francis Ford Coppola, he did a great job(in fact Paramont prepared to replace him anytime. Lukily they did not do so). He is an Italian. Maybe Italian emphasizes the importance of family. When he directed the movie, he successfully made the cast like a family. No wonder he still could gather the same cast to shoot Godfather the third after 16 years.As to performance, Al Pacino is unforgettable though he was a rookie. Marlon Brando deserved the Oscar award (best actor). Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also were great. As to the music, still great.A mafia classic you absolutely should not miss. 9/10", "Excellent but not great....": "The godfather is widely regarded as the greatest film ever made in the history of cinema.Widely considered a milestone,the movie inspired countless films. It might be a shame to admit but i hadn't seen this movie until 2015.After nearly 42 years of its release i finally got a chance to watch it.After watching the movie i found its story to familiar.It is because i have watched countless movies which are directly or indirectly inspired by this film and i must say that this movie was far better than those rip- offs. The movie has a great story.It shows the transition of a reluctant family-man to a crime family boss.The screenplay is absorbing.The cast is wonderful and everybody is peerless in their respective roles.In short this film is superb and wonderful.But i can't consider it as a great film.I don't know why it is called so?May be it had been a very original story during 70's but now it is not so.I am not a film scholar,neither i am a movie buff nor a cinema aficionado but i have seen many classics of World cinema and i found some movies which are far better than this one. I am not saying that this is not a great film.It is great,after all so many people like this and so many can't be wrong.This is a respectable movie after all this movie has influenced countless films.This movie might be great but not the greatest ever. This is an excellent example of mobster film.Positive points of this film are its evergreen story,its soulful musical score,its engaging screenplay,nice direction,great dialogs and amazing acting.The only negative point of the movie is its slow pace and overlong runtime.So at last i want to say that it is an awesome piece of art and everybody must watch it.May be due to time difference or due to cultural gap,i was unable to grasp it completely. 7.9 out of 10 is my final rating.", "\"I will make him an offer he can't refuse\"": "I was always embarrassed to confess that I hadn't seen the Godfather trilogy. So last night I finally saw the part one of the Corleone family saga. The film was as brilliant as I had expected, and more.\"The Godfather\" thrills right to the core of the world of Italian-American (gangster) families after the second World War. In the year 1946 the Corleone family has a powerful position in the under world. The family's head don Vito Corleone (just amazing Marlon Brando) has connections and relations in politics, police forces etc. But he also has enemies. There is also four other families wanting to have as much power as they can get. The first big trouble emerges when don Vito refuses to take part in narcotic-business. There is conspiracy and vengeance bubbling underneath.One of the most fascinating themes in the movie is Corleone's youngest son's (Al Pacino) struggle of being part of the gangster family. Don Vito does not want Michael to involve family business but the blood is thicker than wine. Michael says he is not going to become like his father but in time he will realize that his destiny is to become the Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola's magnificent directing and amazing script of the author Mario Puzo makes \"The Godfather\" very enjoyable and thrilling to watch. Also the talented cast (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall etc.)is like a cherry on the top of delicious ice-cream portion.The film is really capturing. Almost three hours long movie didn't felt so long at all. After watching the film I sure was thirsty for more!", "The Magnitude Of \"The Godfather\" Achieves In Assisting One's Love Of Film To Grow Beyond All Measure": "The majority of critics will cite the definitive \"greatest film of all-time\" as Citizen Kane, but other films are regularly mentioned in conjunction, one of those being The Godfather. Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called \"gangster flicks\", most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses \"gangsterism\" as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to \"join the family\" because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.Arguably, the theme of \"violence breeding violence\" is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the \"matter-of-fact\" nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the \u0096what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the \"false\" commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture. Composed by Nino Rota, the score enhances the emotive style that the film follows throughout the duration.I have been watching The Godfather for many years now and it remains one of my unquestionably favourite films. Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective. All this is much more than a fleeting glimpse of cinematic heaven, considering the viewer becomes just like one of the characters, a controlled puppet for a game, which -in the case of the film- does not manipulate, but engages.", "The Greatest work of cinema of the 20th century": "The Godfather has everything that quality cinema needs, gripping story, a fantastic script and marvellous acting.The Godfather is an adaptation from the novel with the same title. Marlon Brando plays the character of Don Vito Corleone with complete emotion, meaning and accuracy. Al pacino's character of Michael Corleone and son of the Don. These two main characters grip the audience throughout the epic tale of gangland New York and the changes through the mid 20th Century. Through Don Vitos decline as the Godfather the reluctant Michael is dragged further in. Pacino performs his greatest part through this. The Godfather is Francis Coppola's greatest work among many classics. The story of a great family in the dark gangland years of New York will be one of the most recognised in 20th century cinema.", "Let me begin with just one word.. Masterpiece.": "The Godfather is not just a crime film, it's much more deeper than that. It's about loyalty, respect and more than anything, it's about family and real life. The casting in this movie is flawless. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a perfect casting choice. He brings his unique style to his character and makes him alive. He's not just acting his role, he's living it, at least that's what it feels like. He truly deserves his Best Actor Oscar. Every scene where he is in and every line he says is emotionally touching and breathtaking, and it's not just because of his acting, but it's also because of the film's magnificent writing and directing. The storyline is outstanding. It's based on a novel written by Mario Puzo. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job with bringing his story to the screen. He really gave us the best film of all time. Brando wasn't the only one who did a wonderful job with his character, because even though Vito Corleone was the key element of the movie, the movie was still mostly about his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. You can really see his character develop during the movie, and you can feel the respect that his character has toward his father. There's a real connection between those two, even though they have a small number of scenes together. Besides Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, there were other supporting roles that were amazing as well, like James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and of course the beautiful Diana Keaton as Kay Adams. This movie has everything. Good acting, directing, writing, cinematography and of course memorable and recognizable music by Nino Rota. In my opinion, there is only one misstep in this film, and that is the lighting in the wedding scene in the beginning of the movie. I can honestly say that this is my favorite movie and if you haven't seen it yet, you should watch it as soon as possible! 10/10 Excellent!(These are just my quick thoughts about this movie)", "Must See": "The Godfather is a must see. Most of the movies today have taken some of the elements from The Godfather. This movie is well done, well told & well shown. I wish most movies today took the time to make sure the details are as noted in The Godfather.", "Simply Excellent----9/10": "It is no wonder The Godafather is often regarded as the best film ever. It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent. In my opinion Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever, but this pulls in an ultra close second. 9/10", "This movie is beautiful.": "I really love this movie, and it is my favorite out of all three.  They are unable to fully describe in words, they are masterpieces.  This and the other two movies inspired me and moved me emotionally. I was crying at the end of the third movie!  I felt as though I knew the characters personally, and felt anger and grief and sorrow and happiness throughout the rise and near fall of the Corleone Family.  This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made, and you haven't lived yet if you love movies and haven't seen these films.", "Best Movie Ever.": "The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie.", "The \"Gone With the Wind\" of Mobster Movies": "Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" truly qualifies as the \"Gone with the Wind\" of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, \"The Godfather\" received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, \"The Godfather\" cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, \"The Godfather, Part II\" surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered.", "A 'Prince' of a Movie": "Marlon Brando delivers one of his best, if not 'the' best, performances of his award winning career, as the 'feared and loved' Godfather.\nAl Pacino, as son Michael Corleone, will also captivate you with, again, a career pinnacle performance. (He'll match it though, in part II).The list goes on with just awesome performances in this timeless classic: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and on and on and on.Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's novel, almost verbatim. (In fact, when part one and two are combined it is the novel in its' entirety)In this pre-digital creation, one must also pay close attention to the technical aspects, like the flawless props, the automobiles, costumes and backgrounds which mimic the 1940's through the 1950's. The cinematography is art and the music is haunting and beautiful.This film is classic cinema, a timeless work of art. Put in on your must see list, or see it again just for the details.", "Great!!!!!": "Totally superb from acting to directing to plot to dialogue.  Definitely in my top 10 list and a joy to watch over and over again.  To be fair there are a few negatives.  At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying.  Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel.  The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon.  In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly.  You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen.The character of Lucy was just seen as a tramp used by Santino in the movie where she was a fairly interesting character as well as Johnny Fontaine. Anyone who has seen the movie should also read the book to understand what I mean.", "3 hours of boredom": "This is the 3rd time I watched this movie...and I always found it boring.Today I watched it to see if it really was the best movie ever made...and no, it's not.It's not the best...it's not the worst.In reality 0 this is maybe a 4 or 5 or maybe a 6.But to bring the score down from over a 9.5 to reality, I voted it a 1.Not fantastic actors, not a fantastic script. Nothing mind blowing about this.Lots of stuff didn't even make sense.It drags on and on and the story barely comes to a close.This movie is so far over-rated, it's sad really.There are so many other better gangster mafia movies out there than this.Not too violent, not too intense. Just really long and boring. Even for a 1970's movie, this is overly long and boring.Goodfellas is far better and the Sopranos is also far better than this.Highly over-rated.", "A must watch especially with director's commentary": "Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies I'm sure you'll experience the same.", "The Greatest Crime Drama Ever Made": "This is by far the best Crime Drama ever made. It is much better than Goodfellas, which is good but it is a bit overrated. Marlon Brando is excellent in this movie. Although, sometimes I think of him as more of a supporting role than a leading role. He was still excellent. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all excellent in their supporting roles. I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in.The acting is definitely a plus in the Godfather and so is its Directing. It also has one of the best scripts ever written. No flat Dialogue or any corny lines. This is and will remain the best Crime Drama ever made. Thats a promise.", "That was pathetic.": "I don't see what anybody saw in this movie, boring, and redundant. I was bored with the film, and it is a horrible attempt to make a good movie. If you have any taste what so ever you will turn down a crapfest like this and watch something respectful like Batman, or The Rookie, or heck even Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In any event stay away from this waste of film. 0 out of 10.", "After this the gangster film would never be the same again": "The gangster is the unacceptable face of the American myth. He is the antithesis of the western hero; he is not society's saviour but its public enemy. The 1930's gangster film was rooted in headlines of the day; it was a resolutely contemporary genre. The first gangster cycle responded to the restrictions of Prohibition and the effects of the Depression. These gangsters defied harsh economic realities and in doing so became anti-heroes of the people. Their defiance of authority made them relevant and popular; they were the dark side of the American dream.In the first cycle of gangster films, the criminals were positioned as alien to the WASP norm. These Italian and Irish gangsters were separated by their ethnicity. The Hays Code soon came in to try and combat these films. It forbade the vilification of ethnic groups and banned films focusing on criminal behaviour. This shifted emphasis to law enforcers. It was hard therefore to truly make gangster films. The genre was pushed to the margins and remained out with the mainstream for a long time. In the late 60's Bonnie and Clyde changed all this. Its mix of violence, New Hollywood style, anti-authoritarian stance and counter-culture relevance brought the gangster film right up to date. The scene was set for The Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola's film was the first epic gangster film. It made it a durable genre. But it was significantly different to the 30's gangster movies like The Public Enemy. It was not a rise and fall narrative. Don Vito Corleone begins the film at the height of his powers and dies peacefully while playing with his grandson; he does not die in the gutter. Neither does he exhibit the brash over-reaching arrogance that typified the 30's gangsters. He treats his position within the community as a responsibility and he has moral limits. The film does not end with the fall of the crime family; it climaxes with Michael Corleone at the absolute peak of his powers. The changes to censorship now allowed for a narrative to focus on criminals, in the case of The Godfather it went as far as virtually eliminating every other point-of-view; in this film people out with the crime family are the aliens. Where the 30's gangsters were at odds with society, the gangster here is the power structure. The Corleones are the good bad guys. When this film was made Vietnam had destroyed the certainties Americans had about their country. The Godfather seemed to say if American society is rotten, organised crime is only part of the problem, sometimes the solution.The film stressed the universal theme of loyalty to the family. This helped cloak its critique of American society in a conservative framework. It not only put the gangster back in the centre of film narrative but it also stressed ethnicity in a positive way. They were no longer apart but important members of the establishment. The law enforcers depicted here are more corrupt. They act in a criminal way but without any moral code. In many ways it is a transgressive film.Acting is great across the board. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall stand out particularly in a true heavyweight cast. The story unfolds beautifully with a fantastic script to propel it. Coppola holds the whole thing together with some brilliance. He doesn't really do anything fancy but just lets all the superlative components at his disposal do their thing and ensures they all connect together into a film of huge class. The Godfather is a masterwork and remains a primary reason why the era of the New Hollywood will always be cherished.", "I like movies more than books": "Godfather has a epic soundtrack. I am sure that someone who has a little knowledge about movies, is privy to this OST. It is a masterpiece for sure.The first time I watched this movie I had a 2 CD version of it. The second CD was broken/scratched and I really was so bored that I did not consider to watch this part on stream. I don't know why this movie is so high rated even if my father likes this movies.I do not blame anyone for watching this series of Godfather but those who watched it, cannot tell why they like this movies either. By the way I have watched every film starring Al Pacino and these are the only I could not finish at all! It has a very long, uninteresting and well known story which has a high budged. If you don't believe me, ask your friends who watched it. You will see what I am trying to tell because they only will tell you: \"Well.. it is.. just watch it! It's a great movie\".", "The greatest movie ever made": "This is a masterpiece! The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history ever. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you to see this movie.\nThis movie is very strong, very good script, great casting, excellent acting, and of course great directing.\nI love this movie!", "Extraordinary Masterpiece": "A francis ford copolla classic that takes me to different worlds every time I watch it, and deserves 10 points from me with its shooting techniques and fascinating atmosphere. I wish I was in my twenties when this film was shot and I could watch this movie in the cinema.", "How rare a pearl.....": "This is a film--it's too dignified to call it a movie--that shatters things we usually take for granted about the genre.  Movies are never as good as the books on which they're based--but this one is.  Films about Italians always wallow in stereotypes--but this one doesn't.  All-star epics always disappoint--but this one doesn't.Pacino is truly amazing to watch as he gets drawn into the family business, and Brando's best scene is, oddly enough, his final one, where he's playing with his grandson.  This is a man who's ordered countless deaths, beatings, etc., but to a small child, he's just Grampa, and he's the most wonderful grownup in the whole wide world.If you've never seen this movie, you're doing yourself an injustice.  Get it, see it, experience it.", "Excellent and Completely intriguing": "So I have finally seen one of the most iconic films of all time. How does it feel? Like I accomplished something. One has to be keen on not having huge expectations when one watches films of this grand respect and stature in history. How was it?The film does start slow, and from the first appreance of Brando to be honest I couldn't understand him much. However, over time goes by I was more and more interested in him. I was shocked when several scenes played out, and I am surprised that this isn't Brando's film. This is Pacino's film. Pacino is completely mesmerizing in his approach and character, and he is the one who has a transformation. He is somewhat of a bigger lead character than Brando. The entire cast is outstanding, and you really get to appreciate the script when you can really see the film with subtitles and realize how great the dialogue is.Ready for Part 2!", "a family man": "The greatest film ever said by many. First film of the greatest trilogy ever said by many. I agree with second one, but not the first one. This is the greatest trilogy. And the first film is the pearl of that package. I drew my expectations extremely high before watching this classic. Unfortunately I had to fall. I didn't get the grain, that cutting-edge I was looking for. Fortunately the fall wasn't that high. I still liked the movie a lot. It was a great picture. A massive film in its genre. I like good mafia films. But I don't fancy them that much. But like I said, in its own genre this picture is a front runner.The cast is the strongest part of the movie. Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) as The Godfather is like a fist to the eyehole. He is just so boss. At the same time he is so wise and calm. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and others give a very good contribution, but it is Marlon Brando who shines throughout the movie. The line 'the man who does not spend time with his family, is not a man' is epic.There are lots of classic music in this movie. Some parts of the movie are in Italian. This is not your regular Hollywood movie. This is not that entertaining but still after seeing this, you'll probably say 'wow'.", "Best acting ever": "I think what made this movie so great was the actors. The directing was also very superb. As i watched this movie, 30 plus years or so after it was made, i totally was engulfed in what was going on in the movie. Most great movies that i see that are older seem to be dull and boring, not this one. Yes it is long, and i had to take frequent breaks, it was far from boring. This is one of those movies that after i saw it i started acting like i was in a mob family. I started saying \"I'm going to make him an offer he cant refuse.\" This movie is a great movie that mixes all kinds of genres, from romance to action, but it is mostly a full out drama. This movie is defiantly deserving of the top honor for best movie. I recommend it to all people, and even if you cant appreciate the plot, you have to appreciate the acting. By far the best acting in any film i have ever seen.", "The Mafia Masterpiece you cannot refuse!": "The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made. A complex and detailed gangster epic from 1946 to the late fifties on the Corleone family 'business'.It stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the most powerful lord of the Cosa Nostra, approaching the twilight of his life, the Don and his family come under attack from a Turkish gangster called Sollozzo who is angry at the Don's refusal to give him legal protection for his new drugs business, and so a war begins between the five families of New York city over a period of five years. Slowly the Mafia Don's reluctant son Michael (who is a decorated soldier) takes over and later self-discovers that he was always destined to be a man like his father.This is really what the heart of the story is all about, a man who wanted to be honest and good in life but because of terrible circumstances takes over an Empire and becomes a figure he always denied.The cast and supporting players are all excellent but the standout is Al Pacino.Ten Out Of Ten.", "Don't ever take sides against the family": "Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can understand just by the way the characters look at each other and talk to each other. Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so \"The Godfather\" becomes something of a rarity. So much so that \"The Godfather\" (played brilliantly by Marlon Brando) himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprise. Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. What else can I say about this movie that no one else has said: it's a classic and for good reason.", "Near Perfection To The Last Detail,": "The Godfather is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There is no questioning the sheer brilliance of this film, it is a perfect example of how movies are very much an art form, the beautiful set pieces and skillfully written dialogue are just two examples of that. The story grabs you immediately, despite the lengthy three hours, it flies by as we are engrossed in to these characters and their struggles, as Roger Ebert once said, a bad movie can never be too short, and a good movie can never be too long. The cast deliver some of the best performances ever witnessed, from the masterful acting of Robert Duvall, the engaging James Caan and the raw emotion of Al Pacino, they all showcase career highlights. The star of the show is, without a doubt, Marlon Brando, an actor with so much range and versatility, he is spellbinding as the Don, every word, every movement, has meaning, a well deserved Oscar win. An engaging story, pitch perfect performances and gorgeous direction, The Godfather is a must see for all moviegoers. A young man is forced to take control of an organised crime ring as a result of his father's decreasing health.

Maybe it's because I've hear quotes from this movie for the past 49 years. Maybe I've read too much about the making of this film. I don't know. It's still a really good movie. Don't get me wrong.

Can't find an answer, dig deep.The hierarchy in human beings is reflected in many forms of our creation including religion, race, communities and nations. The order is established only when there is a leader (even in communism). Godfather and the other characters in the movie establish the order of human beings with balance of power (to lead, communicate and protect).This movie has presented the ideology of Godfather in a way that predicts human nature better than many other films.

Sean Connery's performance as a spaniard in Highlander was more convincing.Al Pacino's performance is total rubbish. The only good part he can do is a queer and that's in Dog Day afternoon.As and for the director, Paul Verhoeven did a better job with Showgirls!!What is wrong with a bit of rape in a film, this is the mafia we are watching on the screen, if they are going to portray what the mafia are really like, then at least show what they do behind closed door.Very Poor!!!! 1 out of 10!!!", "Pretty good, but bore at times.": "Pretty good, but a bore at times.

The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has.  It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie.  You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era.  I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point! I think I'll go watch Marlon Brando's greatest performance...Guy's N Doll's.", "Watch it twice!": "I wasn't too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say it's a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but I'm not denying that it's a good movie.Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it like I did!", "THE BEST": "There is no doubt in my mind concerning the fact that The Godfather is the best movie of all time. From the flawless directing to the powerful acting, this movie is a must for every home video collection. Even today this movie still has the elements of surprise and shock which the majority of older movies no longer hold. Who could ever forget the memorable horse head scene. How the AFI ranked this movie number three still baffles me to this day. Coppola put his best forward and left all others behind.", "A gem above the rest": "This movie is hands down the best movie ever produced. The story that you see and the story that you don't see are both exciting and powerful. While action packed and emotional this movie will never fail to entertain me even I'd I watch it on repeat for a year I will always love it.", "The Godfather: 7/10": "I hate reviewing classic movies, since most have a reputation and I feel like I'm not an actual moviegoer/critic if I don't like the classics or give them a certain rating. Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it.In Francis Ford Coppola's Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a famous family mafia. The film goes through their various escapades as a crime family.I really, really enjoyed watching The Godfather. The almost-three-hour runtime seemed to fly by. I was enthralled by the sincerity of the acting and the horrible true-to-life feel of the film. All of the acting was dead-on, although some of the screaming could have been a little better. With up-and-coming stars at the time such as Al Pacino, how can you go wrong?However, with all movies, they can't be perfect. The film could, or should, have had more plot to it. I know it's supposed to be \"a day in the life of\" type movie, but if it had been with one adventure for most of the way it would have helped. Also, there were lots of supporting characters who we can't remember about for three hours. If that wasn't enough, all of the characters looked like either tall or fat white men with thick Italian accents, making them hard to understand (and of course I had to rent the VHS version so I couldn't read subtitles). More towards the end, I couldn't tell who was on whose side. The ending could have been trimmed down a little; the last half hour or so seemed to actually be boring and not very exciting. Maybe Coppola put it in there so the movie could have the designation of being \"one of those long classics\".I was surprised about how little strong language there was for a crime movie like this. I would have guessed all the characters to be swearin' like a sailor, but I was surprised. The amount of blood didn't surprise me, but I commend Coppola for putting so much in.Pacino looked like he does now, minus bags under his eyes. Brando gained about 200 pounds after The Godfather. And, Abe Vigoda looks exactly the same as he did thirty years ago. Yes, that's right. Abe Vigoda is in this movie. Hurray!The Godfather is an entertaining movie that is overrated but still fun to watch as three hours pass.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong violence, blood, brief nudity, and constant but mainly minor profanity.", "Hshs": "Fantastic thanks for this Miracle....... \ud83d\udda4 \ud83d\udcaf Al Pacino is the best actor after this movie.", "Mind blowing film with a best casting .": "This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film.

The youngest son of the Corleone crime family, Michael, wrestles with the possible fate of his and his family's fortunes as he sits across a restaurant table from the gangster, Salazzo, hungry for the power of the Corleones and the police chief in his employ. He looks down, wide eyed in thought but also at the raging fires of the abyss as he contemplates whether to flee the scene and secure the downfall of his family or kill the two figures who most immediately threaten his family and interests. A train's wheels on the track become the wailing of the damned as Michael pulls himself out of these thoughts, pulls out a gun and kills them. So begins Michael's inexorable slide into powerful evil. In exile from is double murder charge, in Sicily, he is able to flex fledgling muscles of power and suffers not a little tragedy. These are inoculations, tinctures of the life he will embrace when he returns to America. It is as if his soul feeds on these morsels to steel itself for the trials and tribulations of the rank of Don.The wise-cracking college kid who displayed some bemusement at his family's business returns to embrace it more vigorously and more purposefully than his father ever did. His father became a powerful criminal out of necessity, Michael does it as if to prove his mettle, that he can be greater than his father and combines traits of his brothers - Santino's rage and warrior spirit, Fredo's duplicity and Tom Hagen's cunning - to achieve his goal.As the door finally closes on Kay at the end of the film, the door closes on the Michael she fell in love with all those years before.", "what a masterpiece": "The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This will be a movie that will live on through history.", "8.8": "Marlon Brando is exceptional. Fight scene between Sonny and Carlo is grossly fake and you can see how he misses the punches so unbelievably obvious.", "Good movie": "I saw the movie it is good movie without any lag in the story telling", "overrated": "This is barely a masterpiece in my opinion. The direction and acting are completely flawless but it lack a lot in writing compared to what people say. Its pretty enjoyable tho ngl.", "Re-configured Genre": "During the 1970s, American directors decided, like their French counterparts did in the previous decade, to elevate and transcend the genres that appealed to them as children growing up in the 1940s and50s. Lucas took Buck Rodgers and Science Fiction to new levels, as didSpielberg with the Action/Adventure movie.Some re-made war movies in their own image; others re-configured the Western. Coppola took a stab at elevating the gangster film from B-movie to artistic masterpiece.On some level, he succeeded, transforming the gangster film from movies about crooks to movies about crooks and their families.Though it may not seem like such a difference, adding that familial component made movies about organized crime much more interesting than they had previously been. When critics discuss the great gangster films, few films made before the Godfather are mentioned. The Godfather, in one sense, made gangster movies as we know them. That is no small feat and Coppola ought to be commended for that. He made a solidly acted and directed film in a genre not usually known for those attributes.However, the Godfather is not the greatest movie of all time. It is not even the greatest gangster movie (that would have to go to Goodfellas) or the greatest movie of 1972 (compare it to the dynamic performances of Sleuth, the absolutely absurd and insane Ruling Class, and Bunuel's masterpiece, the Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and you will find the Godfather lacking).Do not mis-understand: the Godfather is an eminently watchable movie, filled with great performances and guided by the sure hand of a very gifted director. It is simply, though, a very good movie - no more, no less. Perhaps I'm able to take a step back from The Godfather because I wasn't there at the timeI understand its appeal and I understand why people call it one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, but I cannot agree with them. It lacks an intangible quality that all great movies have; it lacks an aura. Movies like Close Encounters and Chinatown have an aura that, though difficult to describe, simply exudes greatness.The Godfather lacks that intangible quality while maintaining all of the tangible qualities of a great film. That one, almost invisible piece, though separates the very good from the great. That intangibleis vital and is something this film simply does not have.", "This movie SUCKED": "The following writing which you are about to read has little bits of things in it that might spoil the movie if you haven't seen it (which I would not recommend). So please do not read this OR see the movie.This movie sucks. This is one of those rubbish old mafia films from 30 years ago back when they still didn't know how to make them properly with lots of killings and foul language. It's just rubbish. If I wanted to watch fat old men sitting around a table and talking for three hours I'd go to some place where they do that and watch them instead.It doesn't even have any plots to it. Everybody just speaks in a strange language like I'm supposed to understand that. This one guy in the movie is the worst heaving windbag I've ever seen in my life. He even kills himself with oranges which is so stupid because oranges aren't even poisonous.Please do not watch this film. It is too rubbish for words (although I have used words in what I have just said). Watch a proper mafia film like Goodfellas or Corky Romano instead.", "Powerful and violent": "I thought the film was very powerful, but a tad too violent for me. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny.", "In the Godfather, even the cat is a good actor": "I love that this scene establishes the entire theme of the films--which is family and relationships. The scene is basically \"this movie is about the mafia, but it's not John Wick and this is not about murder. And we are not hitmen. We are people who value our relationships\"", "An offer I could refuse": "To my opinion, the most overrated film of all times.An overrated story of an overrated person (America's infamous home grown terrorist), played by an overrated actor - Marlon Brando, which has almost nothing left from the juicy stud that made your lips wet in \"A streetcar called desire\".Rather than being a fine adaption of an anyway colorful book, and a playground for an impressive group of talents, the movie has not much else to offer. No one of the actors is at his/her best.Technically, Coppola is a genious. The best 2 dimension director. But his films always lack the 3'rd dimension. You're coming out great, Frank, but what exactly are you trying to say?", "All you could every want in a movie": "For the first time in my life, I was blessed able to watch this masterpiece. The film has aged well since it was released and I was very impressed.This film is about the Corleone crime family and their struggles with the other crime families.This is Marlon Brando's best film in my opinion, and every actor and actress does a fabulous job.The film is rather long, so make sure you have plenty of time on your hands to watch it. It took me a few days to watch it, but I was recovering from surgery, so I could only watch a little bit at a time.", "A Masterpiece.": "Everyone in this movie has outstanding acting, especially Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, And John Cazale. Every time I watch this piece of art I forget that it's a movie due to the fact that the acting is so incredible.", "Lives up to Expectations": "I just saw The Godfather a few days ago. It is a classic movie. Its one of the most well-made movies I've every seen. Its every bit as good as everyone says. I may not give it the title of \"The best movie ever\", but its just as good if not better than any other \"best movie ever\" candidate. Its very realistic. Throughout much of the movie you feel like you're with the characters. You feel like your in the same room with the Mafioso's. Marlon Brando was perfect as Don Vito Corleone. I don't really think his performance could have been any better. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was great, almost as good as Mr. Brando's (and that's saying something). Its hard to explain how great of a movie the Godfather is. You just have watch it and see for yourself. There's just something about it that makes it so believable. The scene with Michael in the bar was amazing. I thought it was the greatest scene in the whole movie. (a runner up would be the horse-head scene). There was so much tension leading up to the scene. It was almost like a mini climax. The scenes in the hospital were also very suspenseful and well-filmed. These scenes were so suspenseful that I think I jumped just when a nurse appeared. This movie is most definitely worth watching, whether you've read the book or not.", "Awesome!": "Great movie from beginning to end. Best in the trilogy. Great cast. Two thumbs up. 10 stars.", "In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.": "This isn't the first time I have seen this film, but circumstances have given me a chance to see it in a new light.I bought a Blu Ray player, and this film was recommended as the film to see in the new format. I was not disappointed. The richness of the color made the film an extreme pleasure.I also watched it with captions to not miss a word of the dialog.There is nothing new that can be said about this film. It is a classic, and the actors are all superb, as is the story itself. It is rare that a film like this comes around, and watching it in Blue Ray just made it all extra special.", "Coppola's Iconic Film": "Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own.The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place.Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot.Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel.The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments.How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores.Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labeled as their most strongest in their career.This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel.", "Color Grading is spectacular": "Color Grading is spectacular.Liked the way the story is told!Good Narrative and not boring at all!It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.", "The purest kind of epic": "All my life I heard of this series known as the Godfather series. Do I really want to invest all this time? I heard each movie is three hours long. Do I really want to watch a bunch of shoot'em ups? About five years ago I broke down and watched the first one in the saga. I was completely dumbfounded and amazed with this masterpiece. Very few movies fall under the word masterpiece and this is definitely one of them. I gave this a 10.", "The strongest movie ever made \"The Godfather\"": "I saw this movie and i fell in love with it. It is the strongest movie i have ever seen .This movie gave a clear and transparent view of \"The Mafia Family\".This movie defines what cinema is(are).Four Thumbs Up!!!! for \"The Godfather\" and i hope everybody who watches this movies falls in love with it. Marlon Brando,i got no words for his appreciation what shall i tell him \"The Real Godfather of Actors\" yes that would be very less to call him so he is above that also. He was born to do Don Vitto Corleone and Don Vitto Corleone was written for him only.Al Pacino,ah what a strong Performance speechless,boundless loved him as Michael Corleone The real Son of The Godfather just can say this.and James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diana Keaton are also the important part without them \"The Godfather\" would be incomplete.just wanna say watch it", "Ill make him an offer, he cannot refuse": "Aged head of the Corleone crime family, Vito Corleone has known peace and power through violence in his clandestine criminal dynasty. When fate intervenes and sends the family into turmoil, it is his most reluctant of sons who must take over the mantle of Godfather to not only keep his family alive but keep there power intact as well.One of the most acclaimed masterpiece's of film history The Godfather is a visually stunning, beautifully performed and expertly crafted film. Bringing its viewer into 1940's New York the viewer can't help but feel as though it was actually filmed within that period. Based off the acclaimed novel by Mario Puzzo, Coppola directs some of the silver screens legends in some of their finest performances. Brando delivers in his most iconic role that will leave you wanting more after the final credits roll. Pacino in what many consider his break out role shows you, the viewer why he will become one of the best performers of a generation, and James Caan delivers in what many consider his finest performance of his career. Spawning two sequels and legions of fans worldwide, this classic has not only held the test of time but remains to this day one of the finest films every created. Anyone who considers themselves a true film buff needs to have seen this timeless classic.", "Film gets its acclaim from being the first big budget anti-hero movie,": "To understand this films acclaim you have to understand censorship in America. Wikipedia has a nice section on the 'Production Code'. In short nothing remotely like this film was seen for decades. So when it was released it was a revelation for American movie audiences. In todays light the film doesn't have the same impact it did back then. The script isn't written that well, the dialogue is labored and dull. Though Brando is amazing and deserved all the accolades he got from the film. The plot is labored as well and drags in many parts. The enemies of the Corleone family aren't 3-d enough to really be too invested in the power struggles. In fact things don't really seem to be alive as in other mobster films like Goodfellas. The illusion of reality here isn't complete. Godfather II is by far the tauter and better film, and the best in the series.", "About the closest thing that 20th Century film came to Shakespearean scale tragedy": "The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2 represent a defining moment in cinema. Few films can claim to be such an integral element of modern film-making as Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's masterpiece that explores the downfall of a man born into the world of the Italian mafia. To describe either film as being perfect is not an overstatement in any means.Coppola's mastery of direction is evident from the very beginning of the first film of the Godfather trilogy. The \"I Love America\" speech tells the audience exactly what they need to know about the world these characters inhabit, and the wedding that follows sets up all that is to befall \"the family\" over the course of the film. Coppola clearly demonstrates a true understanding of the delicate balance between the importance of camera work and the necessity of allowing master performers the latitude to develop their characters to the rich level they achieve.When one combines a perfect script with perfect performances by some of the legends of film, all under the guidance of a director with a mature and tasteful sense of the art of film, the results are inspiring. The Godfather and the Godfather Part II are my favourite films of all time simply because they are the closest thing that the 20th Century ever produced to Shakespearean tragedy. They go beyond the clich\u00e9s of Hollywood sentimentality and strike at the heart of what great drama is about: love, hate, the death of idealism under the weight of the world... and family.", "An offer you can't refuse.": "The Godfather series is one of the most popular in the entire movie industry, and starting with the first one released in 1972 following the traditional Mafia path and some familiar mafia family references, this movie takes you on a journey worthwhile for any Mafia fan. As Vito Corleone takes the control of the Corleone family, you get to see incredible hard-taken decisions that will move the plot radically from a moment to another, leaving you constantly asking what's about to happen next and bringing an incredible sense of excitement to the entire experience. This movie is without doubt one of the best movies ever made, not only for the hardcore Mafia fans, but for anyone who appreciates a good plot and even more, a good universe created around an iconic idea.", "30 years later,it still packs a punch.": "Long before anyone heard of \"The Sopranos\",there was the ultimate epic flick that changed everything in the history of crime dramas and also remains one of the top ten films of all time,and still holds the title today which spawn two sequels and was the film of the decade. This was the apex of what American cimema was and still is today.\"The Godfather\" was perhaps the best three hours you can spend sitting very still and for a good reason. This was one of the top ten films of 1972 and it was a huge success at the boxoffice. This was \"the ultimate gangster film\",and a \"cultural phenomenon\" that still holds true. This was an \"absolutely flawless\",an \"American epic\" based on the best selling novel by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppula. It recounts the \"operatic\" lives of the Corleone family via through its \"intricate\" plot,bravura \"photography\" from cimematopgrapher Gordon Willis and \"iconic performances\" from actors Marlon Brando,Al Pacino Diane Keaton,Robert Duvall,James Caan,John Cazale,and Sterling Hayden. This was the film that depicted the cold side of the mafia life and it was never shown before and it also gave Brando an Oscar in 1972 for Best Actor and it also won Best Picture honors for that same year.In fact,the end result is so \"killer\" that \"nothing comes even close-except the sequel that followed it which basically picks up where the first part of \"The Godfather\" left off.\"The Godfather:Part Two\"-picks up where the first installment of Mario Puzo's epic novel left off. It was a \"real rarity-a sequel as good as the original\"-this \"true masterpiece\" stands on its own laurels as it delves deeper into the Corleone family saga from the early life of a younger Vito Corleone played by Robert De Niro in a breathtaking performance that is not to be missed,to the family's transactions within the organization. It is a moody meditation on the emptiness of power,it's complex plot through its masterfully intercuts that gives us two stories separated by a half-century into a taut heartbreaking tale of innocence lost and though never overshadowing its bigger brother which in turn doesn't go overboard within the boundaries of the book. But it is even more subtle and sublime with some chilling moments between the relationship between Michael and his cousin Fredo. A supporting brilliant cast with includes Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale it won six Oscars including Best Picture of 1974 and also directing honors for Francis Ford Coppula. At over three and a half hours it is grand Hollywood entertainment that is worthy of the title.", "When humanity takes a back seat to the business, you have The Godfather.": "Once again delving into IMDb's Top 250, we come upon The Godfather. Long since clich\u00e9d in its use of \"Offer you can't refuse\", the horse incident and its view of the mafia, Godfather remains compelling 40 years after its release.Vito Corleone is on his last legs. As he enjoys his daughter's wedding, the cesspool of mafiosi politicking makes hay behind his back as his sons vie for control of the family and a monopoly over their section of New York. We see the brutality and efficiency of said underworld at is pinnacle when Corleone convinces a movie producer to give a friend of his a part by beheading his prize horse and leaving the \"note\" in his bed. Any attempt at normalcy is doomed as families are torn apart by violence, secrecy, jealousy and anger as husbands gamble human freight to gain more influence in their inner circles.Marlon Brando is excellent as the Corleone clan's \"eminence grise\", who wryly dies of natural causes while one of his sons is gunned down at a toll, ostensibly for his actions toward other clans as well as his wife. Betrayals are repaid with quick deaths and the juxtaposition of Michael in a church forsaking violence and hatred (Satan) while eliminating his rivals in the background is chilling.The epic lasts a good 10 years as we see the evolution of mafia reach from simple prostitution and bribery and gambling to include illicit drugs, somewhat half-heartedly. At the end, Michael Corleone stands alone as Godfather and alone as husband, betraying his wife's trust to keep silent his actions with the Corleone clan. The Godfather is still an epic, sprawling masterpiece that doesn't seem out of date in 2012, scary a thought as that is...", "Very over-hyped": "Given the rave reviews, I was very excited when I finally had time to sit down and watch this movie start to finish. I ended up more than a little disappointed. My biggest complaint is that the movie glorifies the underworld in a way that ends up seeming very corny--one scene features a bunch of civilized looking crime lords sitting around a table talking about how gambling, alcohol, and prostitution are OK, but drugs cross the line.Sure, the story incorporates a lot of dramatic effects, but in the end I felt like the drama was forced into the setting in a cheap attempt to make mid-20th century organized crime look serious and exciting. In this way, The Godfather is a little bit like rap music--it validates a fast-paced, unlawful lifestyle by glorifying the coming of power and masculinity that its main characters undergo.", "A Godly Bore": "I read \"The Godfather\" novel, it was one of the best books that I have ever read. Not one minute in the story was I not entertained or interested. I was very excited to see how Frances Ford Coppola's collaboration with Mario Puzo, the author of the book, would translate this into a movie.When watching the movie I tried to put all of my memory of the book into the back of my head and try to enjoy the movie. But sadly the movie was just not entertaining as a movie by itself. Yes, the cast is one of the best ever assembled, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, etc.But all of the main events that should be entertaining, like the elimination of all the bosses in the end. Or the murder of Sunny Corleone at the toll both. But sadly they just bore you to the point were you want even Marlon Brando to die, which he later does. Even the performances from the actors themselves, especially Marlon Brando, leave much to be desired from these awesome actors.This is without a doubt the most overrated movie of all time. If you want to see the life of a mobster done right, see Scorcese's \"Casino\" and \"Goddfellas\". These do not only show the life of a mobster, but they are also entertaining with awesome acting from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci every time.I give this movie 2/10, that's because Mario Puzo was involved.", "Extremely overrated": "An overlong and slow film that may have seemed better 50 years ago, but is now boring and very dated. Marlon Brando's make up looks so fake and the obviously Jewish James Caan is badly miscast as an Italian-American. The restaurant meeting would never have happened in reality - Sollozzo tries to kill Vito, and then just a few days later Michael is just going to sit down and have dinner with him? Lol. In any case Sollozzo would have known the police captain had to remain on call 24 hours a day. McClusky would have given a false location, rather than the restaurant, to the police.", "The best cinematic adaptation of a novel... ever.": "Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather was a sweeping tale spanning two generations with a tale that, as director Francis Ford Coppola states, is more the tale of a king with three sons than of a mob war. This view of the novel is surprisingly accurate, and the movie is helped along by it. Granted, the family at the centre of the story is in the business of crime, but the story is more about the family than the crimes.The head of this family is Don Vito Corleone, played to perfection by Marlon Brando. His mannerisms, and the mannerisms of any other mob boss who has survived assination attempts and wars, are captured marvellously in Brando's performance. At no stage did I have any problem believing that I was watching a mob boss rather than an actor just playing his part. Then, of course, there's the three sons: Santino (James Caan), Frederico (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino). The first two of these young men are unsuitable to succeed their father as head of the family business. The youngest, and most unwilling, is ironically the most suitable. This touch makes me wonder if Mario Puzo read Plato a lot when he was writing The Godfather, for it was Plato who said that the unwilling make the best rulers. Filling out the family's ranks are Constanzia Corleone (Talia Shire), who is getting married on the day the film opens to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), and Vito's adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). There isn't a single member of the cast, at least where these important roles are concerned, who doesn't play their part to a disbelief-suspending perfection.As I mentioned previously, the film is more about the family than their business activities. Indeed, the business side of the story really only exists for plot movement. While the film cannot capture every single detail from the novel, such as the intricacies of the business, it does an excellent job of filling out the details. I've yet to see another film where this much detail from the original novel has made its way into the screenplay. Critics accuse this film of being overlength, but this is a load of cobblers. Having sat through a television broadcast of this film that took up four hours once the commercials were accounted for, I can tell you that the film is absolutely riveting. Whether it is the story, the characters, or Nino Rota's amazing score music, this film has everything it takes to keep a viewer glued to the screen for its entire length. Even the slowest part of the film, Michael's pilgrimage in Sicily, is delightful to watch due to its cinematography and doomed romance between Michael and Apollonia.As a matter of fact, the only criticism I have of The Godfather and its first sequel is that the back story of Vito Corleone wasn't developed enough. There are numerous details, such as how Luca Brasi came to be in Vito's employ, which should have been shown in the film. The role of Mama Corleone was also somewhat underdeveloped, as her interaction with Kay Adams was a critically important element of the novel. I don't think she was ever known by any other name in the novel, either, but she was still a living, breathing character with concerns and feelings of her own. Something she was stripped of in the film. All of these elements could have used some screentime because they help the reader/viewer to understand Vito Corleone as a human being as well as as a mob boss.Aside from that one minor complaint, however, The Godfather is the best screen translation of a novel in the history of the art form. Francis Ford Coppola should be knighted for this movie, as he stands head and shoulders above anyone else who has attempted this feat (Stanley Kubrick's failure to get half the detail of The Short Timers, a 180-page novel where half the words are expletives, into Full Metal Jacket, anyone?).", "BORING!!!!!!": "This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen that's all that I'm gonna say.", "One of the all-time greats": "I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and went back again and have seen it numerous times on television since. Francis Ford Coppopla has been fortunate to have not had just a single career defining masterpiece but several and this is one of them. He'll likely have one or two more masterpieces to add to his arsenal of enduring works before he is done. This ensemble cast is wonderful with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Al Martino and on an on. Nonimated for 10 Academy Awards it won surprisingly only three in Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Best Screenplay for Mario Puzo adapted from his novel with Francis Ford Coppola, and the big prize Best Picture. James Caan, AL Pacino and Robert Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, the most ever from a single film in an acting category but so many from the same film caused a split in the vote and Joel Grey from Caberet ended up with the Oscar. Godfather went head to head against Caberet for the 1972 Academy Awards with Caberet wining six to Godfather's three. The Godfather was also nominated for costume design, film editing, sound and music score. Omitted was Gordon Willis with his brilliant cinematography. Willis would go on to be a favorite of Woody Allen in photographing Annie Hall and seven other Allen films. Willis, like many involved in the Godfather would also do Godfather II and III. Production Designer Dean Tavoularis team of Set Decorator Phillip smith and Art Director Warren Clymer give this film a rich look and an excellent period piece atmosphere along with Costume Designer Anna Hill Johnstone. Nino Rota's music score gives the film the flavor of a fine Italian wine. He scored all of Federico Fellini's films in Italy including La Vita Dolce and 8\u00bd as well as scoring such films as La Strada, Obsession, War and Peace and Romeo and Juliet in his long career. This film also features great non-original music from Berlin to Bach and Mozart. Editor William Reynolds would have had quite an ambitious editing project with this three hour film and his skill paid off. The sequel Godfather II was a great film and one of the greatest and most recognized sequels in film history but I would have left it there and not made it a trilogy with Godfather III. I don't know how long this film has been #1 on the IMDb top 250 but it will likely be there in that spot for some time and it will take a film made after it to knock it out of the top spot. Maybe a film not yet made. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it.", "Good, not perfect": "Yes this is a great film, but not flawless. The casting is great, nice plot, some excellent scenes. However the pace is really too slow. I understand that some films need to be long, films with lots going on. But this is 2 hours entertainment, not 3. If this film had been shorter then it may possibly have been the greatest ever.", "The best Gangster film ever made, Possibly the best film ever made.": "The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him.", "Almost fell asleep": "What a boring movie.How can such a movie be rated that high?\nWill always be a secret to me.", "A cinema classic": "This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.The real story of the Godfather is how Michael changes from being an ordinary citizen with no desire to be involved in the gangster lifestyle to eventually become the head of the family. The catalyst for this is the attempted assassination of Vito during a mafia war caused by Vito's unwillingness to become involved in drugs.The acting is quite superb and you shouldn't forget that Al Pacino was a relative unknown when this was released. Marlon Brando won the best actor award for Vito. The screenplay is superb and like all the best films you become extremely involved with several of the characters. A true classic.", "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.": "This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.", "not bad not great": "The Godfather is not a bad movie. But no way in hell is it one of the Greatest movies of all time. It's not great at all. It's a decent movie, but it is absolutely overrated. It didn't even set any precedents or break new ground or anything. It's just a 3-hour long gangster movie with not interesting stuff happening. OVERRATED!!!!!!!", "The Godfather Phenomenon in a Nutshell": "The epic adventures of the Corleone family: Don Vito doesn't want to get involved in drugs, because its a dirty business. This causes repercussions and sparks a war among the five families.The Godfather Phenomenon in a nutshell: people love it for Gordon Willis' exquisite indoor cinematography, the performances, the Scarface value of being able to say sentences in the Don's voice, the in-jokes (give him an offer he can't refuse, go to the mattresses), Nino Rota's iconic musical score, and the iconic scenes (the opening monologue, followed by the Don's first totally quotable speech \"you come into my house on my daughter's wedding day\", the horse's head, Sonny's sprinkler bashing in the busy street, the fruit-market shooting, the toll-way shooting, the gun in the bathroom restaurant scene, the garden fertiliser scene near the end, and the Baptism scene).There are faults in the second film: i think Fredo goes a little over the top, for instance, but the first Godfather is as close as you'll get to a perfect film. If there was a weakest link, though, it'd probably be Diane Keaton. She does bring an interesting quality to it, I agree, but it always looks like she's reading lines. Luckily, she doesn't have too many.It can be difficult to follow, due to the fact that its an adaptation of a long, elaborate book - but i think that contributes to its mystery. You always feel like watching it again to try and figure out who killed who and why.To make a great film, Coppola went back to basics, pure and simple, grande classical storytelling. He took the lessons of the masters to heart, and the result is just one of the best, most beautiful epics in the language.10/10", "Powerful and incredible...": "I cannot believe how long it took me to finally see this movie, especially since I love \"mobster\" movies.  But, no matter how many times they showed it on cable networks, I refused to watch it when it would be edited and cut to pieces.  Finally, I rented The Godfather and it was even better than all that I had heard from everyone.  Although I think Al Pacino has the potential to be a great actor, I haven't cared much for seeing him in movies because he always seems the exact same. However, in The Godfather he was different (yet still the same).  I saw much more versatility in him...from young and full of ideals to finally finding his place in the family business.  He wasn't his usual over the top \"HOOHA\" thug like in so many movies.  Quite refreshing.  Marlon Brando has always been one of my favorites and his performance was fantastic...fitting right into his role like a hand to a glove.The Godfather has become one of my all time favorite movies and the more I watch it, the more I discover what I hadn't noticed in prior viewings.  To me, this is a timeless piece that only gets better with each time you watch the movie.  It definitely has lost none of its appeal in the years gone by.Without a doubt, The Godfather earns a 10 out 10 stars; and of course, is a DEFINITE must see.  But please, don't watch this in an edited version...it simply is not the same.", "It depends what you want from a film": "If you enjoy action paced movies with great character depth and story telling opt for goodfellas. If you like slow paced, drama like story telling opt for the Godfather. It's wasn't my cup of tea but you can see why people might put it into being considered a classic. The movie for the time when released was ahead of its time. Nowadays it would go straight to dvd.", "Life of Mafia in New York": "Probably I have seen this film 3-4 times and always enjoyed it. The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not.", "A Mafia Monster": "This movie is one that has got to be on anyone's bucket list. It is a masterpiece that will never be able to be paralleled in film making history. While it did have its moments of a little too much talk, these moments were fine due to the large amounts of action and death. Personally my favorite death was the one of Luca Brasi, where he will be sleeping with the fishes along side Solozzo and Captain Mccluskey who were of course killed by good guy Michael! The death that saddened me the most was the one of Sonny played by James Caan. With his temper he was able to keep me engaged and entertained throughout. He was probably my favorite character. But the one thing you should take from this is \"Never take sides against the family.\" Be sure to check out my Youtube channel where I do many top 10 lists and its quite entertaining https://www.youtube.com/user/xAdmiralCacti", "The best gangster film yet, but an acquired taste": "I found the godfather to be slightly growling and over long, however I am not a gangster movie fan. You cannot put the Godfather down for it's immaculate acting and terrific set design. Marlon Brando was absolutely fantastic and never failed to shock with his brilliant performance. Al Pacino didn't impress as much as I thought he would, however, he carried off the performance with style. The hidden details within the Godfather are subtle yet enthralling. Attention to detail is duly noted and can be seen in many of the scenes, including where Michael makes his first killing. The change in character is subtle yet powerful and you can't help but wonder whether he's doing it because he wants to or because he feels he has to. all in all, The Godfather was a good FILM however I found it slightly dull but may appeal to another audience.", "Puzo+Coppolla (multiply) Brando= a classic!!!!": "I have read the book years ago, but never saw the movie. I heard it was the greatest movie of all time and there was no criticisms. i saw this just last month, and it is a near perfect film! I have never seen such a powerful, believable, and moving movie since Schindler's List and Braveheart! The film captures the classical viewpoint of the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo in a very dark, but epic way, revealing the mafia as a manipulating and greedy domain of not just villains, but also of their families. The film is almost a family film in such a way that it is about family, the power of it, and that it should be loved and honored. Taht is one of the main reasons why this is such a glamorous film! The story takes place in the 1940s and 50s, and is about a mafia family called the Coreleone's who came from Sicily. They're a very powerful mafia in New York city led by an aging, persuasive man, Vito Coreleone played by the ultimate Marlon Brando.The story kicks off with the issues and members of the Coreleone family. When Vito Coreleone is gunned down by another mafia family, all hell breaks loose, bringing together the family from the hot-tempered Sonny (James Caan) who is the runner up for leading the Coreleone family, Michael (Al Pacino) who does everything in his power to not join the mob, and Tom Hagen (Rob Duvall), whose the advisable councilor.The story follows these individuals and even more towards the history of this family, with its comings and goings of friends and foes, and issues and solutions.The acting top-notched is excellent, especially by Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar. The story is gripping, the settings and costumes are vivid, the cinematography has that gloomy and dark feel, the pace is moderate, the score is dramatic, and the director was well chosen for this film! Everything is great, and i will enjoy this film and over again as millions of others do. 10/10!", "The Great American Film": "Most say this is the best film in the history of film.  That statement is just about as true as they come.  Some say it's not the best film in the history of film.  That statement is also true, The Godfather II is equally as good and can be considered the best.  Then some say it doesn't even make their top 10.  That statement tells you that that person hasn't seen enough films. Finally there are some that say this film sucks.  Those people are an absolute disgrace to the history of film entirely and shouldn't comment on another film as long as they live. This film is as flawless as they come.  There is not one thing that can be considered wrong with it.  The directing, superb.  The acting, brilliant. The screenplay, outstanding.  The cinematography, far above it's time.  The film in general, one of the most stunning films ever made.This isn't a film you can rate on the 10 scale, because it's far above it. For those who haven't seen it, it's a must.  For those who say it's a poor film, like I said previously, they have no taste whatsoever in good films or they just try and get a rise out of just about every other person that hold their copies of the film with pride.  This is The Great American Film in all of it's glory.******************************", "Spine chilling": "Francis ford Coppola's 'Godfather'....this along with its 1974 sequel is movies at its very best.....this is a near perfect movie...I know this has been said a number of times by a lot of people but for once I feel most of them are right. There are a lot of memorable scenes which stay with you long after you have seen it...and I think that is the reason why this is probably the best movie on organized crime, because it haunts you long after you have seen it. Marlon Brando as don Vito corleone is excellent, for which he well deservingly received an Oscar. Al pacino's Michael corleone for me is the most memorable character in the whole of film history, both cold blooded ruthless villain and a tragic hero at the same time, pacino mostly emotes through those eyes of his and his subtle, measured yet explosive performance is responsible for why people keep going back to godfather and try and interpret and justify each of his character's nuances...separate mention for the memorable sequences which Coppola designs...the sepia toned photography and nino rota's hauntingly beautiful score. After mentioning so much, I still remain doubt what makes this movie so great and arguably the greatest motion picture of all time...I guess that is the way with iconic movies...you never know what's the best thing in it yet you keep going back to it again and again...like an offer you can't refuse!", "Great movies...great times...": "Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs. A couple notable titles were \"The Lord of the Rings\" (actually a series) and \"The Godfather.\" Both are excellent movies that are deserving of the top spots in \"best movies ever made.\" However, I was extremely excited when I was waiting for this film.Everything about \"The Godfather\" is not like any other film period - the story is strong, the film-making is excellent, the directing is spectacular - and at first, I thought the film was going to be three hours long! (The last \"Lord of the Rings\" movie clocks in, for the original version, at 3 hours 20 minutes!) This movie is, in fact, about 20 minutes shorter, which was a relief after finishing the \"Lord of the Rings\" series.And yes, I can easily see why this movie got the top spot in IMDb's \"250 Best Movies Ever Made\" list. After seeing this, I started looking at bad movies like crazy just so that I could say \"Been there, done that!\" Hey, I love my movies! \"The Godfather\" is a highly recommended movie. No one should enjoy their movies without this title!", "Vastly overrated movie.....": "Finally took the time to give myself a real treat and watch this film again after about 20 years as I remembered it as a supremely good film. I have watched many movies from all over the world during the years and have developed a keen eye for good film making, so wanted to review one of the \"greats\".After having watched it again, I have no choice but to face the fact that this film is indeed very poor film making and I have to admit that I feel embarrassed that I once actually considered this a good film!The biggest gripe I have with this film is the unbelievably poor and unconvincing acting, devoid of any emotional depth whatsoever. Everybody is sterile and no-one is worth caring even the least bit about.Secondly, almost every opportunity for character dynamics and development is missed. The only character that is developed is Michael Corleone's and even that character is changing from one extreme to the other, in an instant, with no transition whatsoever. The result is characters as mere moronic caricatures to the point of absurdity. A staggering waste of talent.To top it off, the storyline is thin and highly predictable, simply an unforgivable waste of potential.The organized crime genre of films have always fascinated me and continue to do so. With so many truly great films in this genre, don't waste your time on this one. The Godfather is one of the very worst.", "The GodFather? More like thE NodFather (as in I would rather be nodding off on Heroine than watching this crummy, cheap movie)": "Man. This movie has got to be even worse than Chitizen Kane. Martin De Niro really brings the pain with this cheap, crummy piece of tripe that was produced very cheaply and boringly. More like the NodFather. It's soooo boring. They called it \"Gangstarr movie\" but Ice Cube and 2 pac arent even in it yet! I want my 40+ Years back.Marilyn Brando? Who's that? And Al Pachino hasnent even started to turn into a Turkey yet! Thats his only good feature! What a cheap, boring piece of movie that probably isn't even as good as home made movies on youtube.I generously give this movie a 2 star rating due to the fact that it was the first not black and white movie, so really they had no idea what they were doing it;s really just a victim of the times, so we got to hate the players and not the game and just becaue this movie sucks and has no context whatsoever and superheroes werent invented yet I shouldnt be so generous bt I take suypathy to Robert Schorscesesesesssy and (god rest his soul) give it 2 starts.", "Simply the Greatest Film Ever Made": "When watching this film, you really can see and appreciate how many films that has come after take inspiration from this all-time classic. Francis' direction is masterful in every way, Marlon Brando's method acting in this film is immaculate, to me, Brando is Vito Corleone, \"The Don\", \"The Godfather\"", "My last review": "I've never seen the Godfather before but Richie said he was `tired of watching \u0091Snooker Legends' and wanted to watch a proper film. I watched it and thought is was good. The colours weren't as nice as the ones in \u0091Prince of Tides' but it was a decent film with a beginning, middle and an end.The story is about a mafia family, and how the \u0091all American' son gets drawn into being the head of it. This part is played excellently by Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), with my favourite scene being one of the last when he has to avenge the death of his father. It's got to be one of his best performances to date and I can see why Channel 4 viewers voted him the world's greatest actor. Although it's an ensemble piece with a very impressive cast, they are all given a chance to give some great performances, giving each character in the film a real sense of depth.The film is slow, which I think works to its advantage. Francis Ford Coppola tries to keep everything as realistic as possible and that includes the pace at which everything unfolds. It also makes the violence that bit more shocking when it happens.Richie likes this film a lot. He says that the characters in this film are his heroes and that one-day he'll be like Don Corleone. I don't think he meant fat with a funny voice though, but because he hates being a nurse. He also says that this film shows you how important respect is and that I should show him more respect, starting with giving him my PC. I told him that I needed my PC to write my film reviews, but he told me that it could cause a \u0091psychotic resurgence', and that my film reviews were pathetic (he had only read my \u0091Escape From LA' one though).Richie has also had to sell some of my pink pills to his friends so that he can expand his \u0091turf'. I'm not sure what that means; maybe he's getting an allotment or a back yard. Anyway, Richie will be over this weekend to pick up my computer so I guess that this will be my last review.So to summarise:   The Godfather (1972) - Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Abe Vigoda - Written By Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo - Based on the Novel By Mario Puzo - Directed By Francis Ford Coppola - MPAA Rating: R I rate it a 10/10 a must see film", "Crap": "The Godfather is crap...it's a long movie about nothing. I would rather die than watch that crap again...notice crap is written more than a few times? That's because, this is what this movie is...CRAP! The acting is bad, the sets are bad. Overall this is junk. How in the world it's number one on the top 250 is beyond me. You people must have nothing better to do than to watch a movie where people get killed off because they opened their mouths or voiced their thoughts. I can watch that on the news. I hate this movie so much that my roommates are watching it right now, and I have my CD player on as loud as it will go, because I hate this movie! So in closing...The Godfather, all of them, are crap!", "For me, The Godfather isn't the greatest film ever, but still one of the best": "I can't say much that hasn't already been said a hundred times; this is a flawless masterpiece of cinema. It is considered the greatest movie ever made (and although it is not my favourite) it is rightly considered so because I can't pick out any faults in this movie. Everything from the acting (with a cast like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and so on) you cannot go wrong! Nino Rota's score is fantastic and superbly integrated into the film. Marlon Brando gives a powerhouse performance of a lifetime as the now infamous Don Vito Corleone and the music is now referred to as the quintessential mafia music.Not much needs to be explained about the plot as I'm sure almost everyone knows about it. It centers around the Corleone family and their rise through the world of crime. The family consists of Don Vito (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale).I could rave on for ages about why this film is so good but I don't think I need to. The actors capture their roles perfectly and give them depth and emotion. Francis Ford Coppola's directing couldn't have been better, he captures the mood of the 40's and the underground crime world perfectly. He creates an epic, soap-operish feel of a families rise to power through corruption and murder. Nothing at all looks cheap or hokey, the special effects are nasty and the cinematography is beautiful. Basically, this movie is recommended to any person who considers them-self a movie buff (although any self-proclaimed movie connoisseur has to have seen this) or someone who just wants a cinematic gem! 5/5", "Gangster Crime Drama Film": "This is the 2nd best movie of all time as per IMDB.An italian-American gangster family fallen on a difficult situation after ignoring crime business with other notorious family. Don Vito Corleone who was the main GODFATHER had to change his rule to one of his son.After that a lot of changes happened to the family.What changes happened after?\nWho became the Godfather?You have to see this film to know about these answers.My personal Rating is 9.00 out of 10.00#TheGodfather\n#EnglishMovie\n#America\n#Italy\n#ReviewByNRD\n#Iamnrdurjoy", "A Masterpiece!!! Truly a masterpiece!!": "The Godfather is by far one of the greatest films of all time. Since I haven't been on IMDb for over 3 months I got to see quite a lot of great films over the summer. The Godfather has to be the best movie I saw over the summer. Marlon Brando, to my eyes delivered the best character in a movie ever. Wow, such a great film. I started growing into Mafia movies more and now I'm obsessed with it. This is my 5th favorite movie of all time. The screenplay, acting, cinematography, dialouge, and directing were superb!! You have to see this amazing film!! Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and everyone else did marvelous. Thank god they made this movie.10/10", "Best Movie ever done (My Opinion)": "In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. With 175 minutes running time the movie is quite long, but I promise it is worth it.", "Wow": "I would love to make movies like this. This is amazing", "This is a movie you can't refuse.": "If anybody can point out any flaws in The Godfather, I'd like to see them do it. Watching this movie makes me want to join the mob. If somebody ever names me Godfather to their child, I'll be too tempted to give them a horse's head. Vito Andolini Corleone, his sons MIcheal, Santino,and Fredo, his friends Sal and Peter. What a collection of hooligans. This isn't a great movie.It's a perfect movie.", "Not that great": "This movie isnt that good but it's definitely not bad.

Lucky to witnessed such cinema? Yes, but my summary says my current expression. Does Power Always Get It Right ? 'The Godfather', known to be one of the greatest films ever made, is a stab on it's viewer. Francis Ford Coppola has directed it with his instincts, he knows that Mr.Vito Corleone & Family do not exist in real-life. What embodies in an otherwise great film, are it's performances. Late Marlon Brando is stunning as The Godfather. 'THE' actor inside him buries his past and beings a fresh journey here. James Caan as Sonny, is another astonishing performance.'The Godfather' not only personifies power, but also it's MAJOR disadvantages. Let me end this review, this way: If a 1000 plus word review justifies this masterful depresso, I better inform you, that, even a half-page review is a near-perfect respect.", "One of the greatest movies ever made": "This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.Do not miss this movie!", "Under Duress": "First saw this film back in Sydney in the early seventies. Had a certain kudos then as it was a groundbreaking film of its sort. Or so the story goes!\nWatched it on BBC i player as there was nothing else at all in the film catalogue. Main observations after all these decades.\nIn the signature and most memorable moment in the whole 3 hours plus (snooze), I would love to know how the mafia goon managed to get the enormous horses head in the bed without the director in it waking up. Apologies if IMDb have already noted this ludicrous goof in the list of goofs. It was a completely lame scene if you will forgive the pun\nMarlon Brando seems to be having trouble with vocal clarity and was slurring his way throughout the film. Maybe hitting the Sicilian wine a little hard?\nAll in all, including the mammoth length of the movie, no satisfactory end. Of course it was groundbreaking possibly for this reason and this reason alone. They were laying the foundation for a franchise of Godfathers. Something the film industry in the twentieth first century have taken to the max.", "The ultimate scriptwriting inspiration.": "As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, \"The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life.\" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (\"I believe in America. America has made my fortune \"), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the \"offer he could not refuse\" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever.", "Definitely, a great film!": "\"The Godfather\" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values \u200b\u200bof life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy.

Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It's also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different.

Is this the best movie ever? Along with the Seven Samurai and Vertigo i would say yes. The cast is massive, they all have a part to play, and all perform with excellence. The scope is huge, the direction flawless, the score is one of the best, lots of memorable images, lots of violence, and endless points of discussion. if i try to find faults, i would be picky, and the faults would be minor-the wedding scene at the start goes on for too long, with too much singing and dancing, but i can see what Coppola is doing. We get a genuine sense of the family, its home life and business life, with the female members pushed away so that the men can do what they think they have to do. My favourite images are Michael standing outside the hospital, pretending to hold a gun, the first time he sees Apollonia, McCluskey with a bullet in his head, and all the mob deaths at the end. 10 out of 10", "A really masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "Everybody said that this film was the best ever done so I have wanted to see this for years(and the other parts I shall soon see).So when I found out that it would come on DVD I planned to buy it,and so I did. And when I saw it I thought it was an masterpiece.Perfect in every ways. The whole cast acts excellent and Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for best leading role.It\u00b4s also a very beautiful epic and the music is fantastic.I almost forgot to write that the direction by Francis Ford Coppola is also excellent.Still it has done better films than \"the Godfather\" but it\u00b4s really a Masterpiece.If you don\u00b4t own the Godfather collection on DVD run out and buy it now.5/5", "Not actually that bad, I just hadn't seen real crap.": "I still hate this movie, but I have increased its score and given it some slack.I have to say there is an absolute ton of crap far worse than this.Original Title: UnwatchableI spent twenty some years of life before I watched this movie.I was always told that it is the greatest movie ever. I sat down one day and got around to watching it. It is really long. It isn't really interesting, and I could not finish it.This reminds me of Citizen Kane, another movie that gets a lot of praise.I am not sure why this is a 'timeless classic', but it is a fifty year old movie and it doesn't seem timeless to me. If you must watch it, be prepared to watch a lot of stuff that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the story.The problem with anything really revolutionary is that it only looks that way once. Once they change how movies are made, other people follow suit. Then it is no longer revolutionary for those that grew up after the change.I also hold that anything that deviates from a 1.5 hour length is not usually improved upon, and I would happily take a pair of editing shears to this movie.", "It's The Little Things...": "The Godfather casts a long shadow over every single film represented on IMDb, to a point that creates impossible expectations, and frequent accusations of \"overrated\". Let that very subjective criteria be measured against IMDb's very transparent ranking logic: average popularity. Much like the Oscars, the IMDb top 100 might not be ruled by your number 1 film, but by the film the greatest number of people ranked very highly. If you free The Godfather from this weighty title, it still deserves a 10 by any standard.Let's rewind, and consider the insanity it took, back in 1971, to even contemplate giving a relatively novice director free reign to adapt a vast crime saga, in a costly period setting, and starring an \"ethnic\" nobody and a faded has-been. The Godfather is first and foremost a triumph of screen writing, Coppola's original forte, but the fine structure, character moments and dialogue could have been tarnished by a by-the- numbers treatment, and this where the film leaps from good to great.What makes The Godfather one of the finest films ever made is how right all the individual pieces are, and how well they work in unison: the performances, all of them rich and credible, from Pacino's star-making turn to Brando's classic creation; the world of the story, rich and murky, in perfect service of the story; the look, courtesy of groundbreaking work from ace cinematographer Gordon Willis... But dig deeper and it's the small touches Coppola meticulously peppered his film with that make it unforgettable, be it a touching death in an orange grove, or hit men debating the perfect gnocchi recipe.Ultimately, its rewards are double what you'd expect, because, by most accounts (though I still prefer this one), Part II is even better.Unmissable!", "Superb but Part 2 even better": "Marlon Brando's stunningly rich and complex portrait is just one of the many perfections this modern classic has to offer. But--Part 2 is bigger, better, richer, and better in every way. Not to diminish what a stunning achievement this film is.  One perfectly realized scene flows after another, building one on top of the other. A moment of family and togetherness here, a crescendo of violence there, betrayal, duty, honor.  It follows most of the rules established in early 30's gangster films like Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar but is not limited in what it can show and attempts to tone down the melodramatics to a more realistically paced level.   Nearly flawless.  Some of the finest casting and ensemble acting you will ever see in a film by a brilliant director at the top of his craft.  It makes no apologies for forcing you to care deeply for characters who are violent, selfish, greedy criminals.  It makes us believe that at times there really is honor among thieves.  Somehow these people's class system seem fairly acceptable to us--though ultimately cruel, and doomed to end violently.  An essential film. On of the top 50 films of all time to be sure.", "I love it": "The Godfather is excellent Melo drama of crime film. About family, social, personal of our self about what should we do for protect the family and bring a punishment for bad people, and we also must teach a bad people with kindness not with violence.", "The Mystique of 'The Godfather\"...": "Now I have seen 'THE GODFATHER' and its sequels a number of times and can even recite the dialog of whole scenes word for word. I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family.I remember first reading the novel, which I rated as a cultural curiosity somewhere in quality between 'THE DAY OF THE JACKAL' and 'MANDINGO'. The film we enjoyed because of Brando's at that time offbeat performance and the strong ensemble cast. When I went to see 'NOTHING BUT A MAN' with my friend Donald Mack, besides him commenting to me, \"-this ain't no movie, this is real-\", I remember Ivan Dixon telling Gloria Foster in the movie that he was turning out to be just like his father. The manner in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone you see this process of transformation rather than hear the character tell of it. Though in the original screenplay that I was fortunate to read recently, Michael does indeed tell his father, \"-and now I'm just like you.\"Francis Ford Coppola has made many interesting statements about this unlikely and serendipitous masterpiece he has wrought. Some of the reviewers have compared it to 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' complete with a spaghetti dinner, and Coppola himself once compared Don Vito Corelone to King Lear, a man whose void will be hard to fill ere his Kingdom is to be kept from collapsing. Michael, as we come to discover, has the cold Machiavellian cunning, Santino has the muscular viciousness, Fredo the sweetness of a kindly sense of compassion, and Tom as the adopted son the calm deliberation for moderation, and yet not one of these individuals has all these attributes so harmoniously blended into their personality as the Don himself.And who is this Don Vito Coreleone? A man alone with his own thoughts who well realizes he could have been more than he is given an uplifting childhood environment and better circumstances. A natural leader who is even something of a statesman to hear Mario Puzo tell it in his novel, who yet and still played by Brando is a walking shell of a man able to offer his family nothing beyond their material success other than an incremental spiritual decay. Should you doubt this, review the endings of 'THE GODFATHER-II' and 'THE GODFATHER-III again. Now that I look back on it, I don't believe 'THE GODFATHER' would have become the success it is today were someone else to have acted Brando's role. There is an intelligence and a liveliness to all the portrayals from Diane Keaton to Robert Duvall to James Caan and others, but there is something haunting and understated about Brando's performance in this film that speaks to the mystery of unfulfilled human potential. Of all the performances that I revisit in this movie from time to time his is the only one that seems to have grown in stature over the years. Sure, I understand better now what a tight spot Michael was in with the death of Santino, and now sitting at his father's funeral, watching Barzini shake hands with his colleagues as though he were the heir apparent, he realizes that he is just the next item to be checked off on the list in a power struggle he inherited more than signed up to fight. That is, unless like Telemachos, he can carry out the plan he and his father designed before Don Vito went off to his grave.I know my girlfriend at the time felt cheated and disappointed with Brando's performance. She wanted more of Stanley Kowalski's animal vitality or the roaring declaiming of Brando as Mark Anthony in 'JULIUS CAESAR'! But I understood, even though I was not at first viscerally affected by it so much, what Brando was doing. The acting that Brando does in 'THE GODFATHER' is the acting of personal presence altitude. The power of his portrayal comes not from what he says or does, but from what he doesn't say or does. It is an understated performance that evokes and causes you to add your own connotations to what he is doing. Here is a self made man who somehow worked himself through material success from something to nothing and is puzzling to himself how he got there, but he is not going to let you see him doing it.I know and have read how Pacino and many others thought he should have been nominated for Best Actor honors along with Marlon Brando and whether he should have or not is more than I know. All I do know is that there were times when the action got hot and furious, and that I was tensely waiting for Don Vito Corelone to appear again, not say or do anything particularly, just appear, and somehow by just appearing stabilize the narrative and bring some kind of sense and order to his surroundings. There are people like that, you know. I remember when I would watch 'Young Abe Lincoln' there was a point in the story where Lincoln played by Henry Fonda would not be physically in the scene, and yet you could feel his shadow over the entire proceedings. Brando's Don Vito Corelone is the moral inversion of all of this. When he lays his plans with his son Michael, you glimpse the roles that Brando could have played; Socrates, Ernest Hemingway, and even Black Elk. The roles of idealism that James Coburn berated him for not playing. And who can say there wasn't time, there just wasn't time?", "Simply The Best": "The Godfather is one of those movies that come around once ever so often that leave you in awe of it's greatness. Its a story of so many demintons, twists and turns and yet, it's not hard to follow. The Godfather is a film where it's hard to pick the bad guys from the good guys. It's a story of how even the most innocent of people can take part in the most despicable actions if the right pieces come to place. It's a story of family, love, hate, and murder. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a sure fire classic that wont disappoint. Spoilers Ahead So The Godfather is about this Mafia boss named Vito Corleone (The Late Marlon Brando) who is a Italian immigrant who came to this country during the early 20th century (as you will see in part II). So he's in the gambling racket in New York and has many crooked politicians and other people of power right in his pocket. He has 2 Sons: Micheal (Al Pacino)and Sonny (James Cann). Sonny is his right hand man who is hier as head of the family, Sonny is the epidiemy of the hothead who is impossible to talk to with out pissing him off. During the film while at a tollbooth in Jeresy he's trapped like a rat in a huge boobytrap and is shot many times, thus his demise. And of coarse there's Micheal who is the innocent one of the family. A war veteran and college boy, Micheal has his hands clean of any blood, at least for a while. One day while getting some fruit, Don Corleone was shot 5 times in the back by a man who he refused to do business with. To say the least, the brothers where not happy. So squeaky clean Micheal comes up with a plan to kill the men who tried to kill his father (by the way, Vito came though). He invited the two men to an old style restaurant in The Bronx to \"talk\". While they were talking, Micheal asked to go to the bathroom. While he was there he grabbed the gun that he hid behind the toilet, he took it out and killed them both. the plan went as planed, but Micheal had to go to Italy until the whole ordeal had cooled down.Some assorted stuff happened (like his brother death) while he was gone but when he was in Italy, he met he future wife Appellonia. They were married for awhile until she died because of a car bomb. Soon afterwards, he gets word of his brothers death and returns to the states. Soon after he returns his father strokes out making him the new \"Don\". Here, you can really see Micheal change from a kind innocent man to a cold hearted mafia man who kills his brother in law, despite the objections of his sister.One of the most cruel and ironic movies ever, The Godfather is with out a doubt the best film ever made. There will never be another one like it, this film had it all. a 10/10 all the way!", "Classic.": "The movie is more than worth watching, it is one of the classic movies of the American cinematography. Al Pacino is as always great. And the story, the atmosphere and the spirit of Italian-American neighborhoods, of \"old school\" mafia, \"La Cosa Nostra\", was transferred amazingly great. You shall see lots of interesting stuff about Italian Mafia traditions, about their Code, that used to value back in the days. In my humble opinion, the second part (The Godfather II) is not as good as this one, and you should definitely see at least this. I remember I first heard of this movie from my grandfather. And if he advised the movie, it meant that it's good indeed. This one was not an exception.", "The Best Movie of the Past, Present, and possibly the Future": "I have seen The Godfather about 30 times and each and every time I see it, it still manages to impress me. It's not like any other \"mob\" movie that's out there. It's about loyalty, honor, and family which were the most important aspects of the early-day Mafia. It exemplifies every aspect of the commitment to keep a family together no matter what. The saga of the Corleone family, from \"Don\" Corleone and then to Michael Corleone, is absolutely brilliant. There isn't one defining moment; the movie as a whole is a tremendous masterpiece. I don't believe there will be another movie that will come close to capturing the depth and beauty of this film; at least not in this lifetime.", "Godfather is the most memorable film ever; flawless!": "I think that Godfather made deep dents in the film industry. I can confidently say that this movie, with such enthralling and compassionate acting and directing, deserves even more praise that it is already receiving. I have watched this movie more than thirty times and each time is even more enriching. Absolutely no blemish. However, let me remind you that THIS IS NOT A CRIME MOVIE, but of mostly of family principles and character which is so lacking in so many other movies.", "The ratings are true, definately #1!": "I eventually saw this film as it is widely regarded as one of the best ever made. The hype and the 10/10 ratings ARE true. This is excellent! I saw Godfather 2 first as it deals with the young Vito in part so comes (chronologically) first in the series but part 1 is the best. From Marlon Brandos oscar-winning performance to Al Pacino (the true star) this film is practically perfect. Vitos demise, Michaels rise, the downfall and eventual success of the Corleone family - all perfectly plotted. Any film that can make you care for gangsters has to be doing something right. There are some dubious moral issues, but this is a movie - you watch it to be entertained. Who can forget the horses head scene, Sonnys assassination, even the oft-repeated quotes such as `I`m gonna make him an offer he can`t refuse`... If you haven`t seen this film then watch it. I only wish I had seen this film earlier.", "Brando rules": "The most famous mafia movie ever made is still the best and the standard by which all others are judged. Maroon Brando transforms himself into Don Corleone, a mob boss of the old school which is changing in the new and violent drug culture.Al Pacino is Michael, his son and most likely heir apparent. A power struggle ensues with the five families of New York. The bloodshed is horrific but also poetic in hands of director Francis Ford Coppola, who only came close again with \"Apocalypse Now.\"Jame Caan is Sonny, the other of the godfather's sons. Sonny is brutal and the opposite of Michael, who has just graduated college but is lured into a life of crime by circumstance. The highlight is a baptism used as a counterpoint to a massacre simultaneously. Just sit back an watch the unmatched Brandon devour the screen.", "We Can't Refuse": "When tackling something of the sheer breadth of Puzo's novel, the screenplay problem becomes not what should be included, but what should be left out.Coppola and Puzo mostly get this right - staying away from minor story threads, and sticking with the broad cinematic sweeps of post-war New York and Sicily.It's when the camera moves indoors that we get enveloped in Coppola's world -- this is where cinematographer Willis cut his teeth, and left a stamp on how movies use lighting ever after -- we can luxuriate in the shadows, congruent with the shady back-room world of mob dealings. The true importance of the movie lies in this, not within the vicissitudes of tit-for-tat murders.Coppola could have played with the Fontaine thread, which is all about the control of Hollywood (and by extension, control of us) through movie vision, but this is almost completely ignored here.One nice touch, straying from the novel; Moe Greene gets it in the eye -- layered symbolism -- of how one 'vision' of the Corleone future is snuffed out, in favor of the violent \"New Cinema\" paradigm.Because Coppola's vision of the narrative was constrained by Puzo's platform, he couldn't quite reach the summit -- that would be achieved in \"Part II\".", "Now ladies and gentleman it doesn't get any better than this.": "Long before serial killers, heroes, comedies, and dramas you had this masterpiece The, Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola knew just how to organize this so well by showing how a family made a living and going to elite power in the process. Marlon Brando is the greatest as Don Vito head of the family, then open the door for son Michael Corleone played perfect by Al Pacino. The, Godfather helped make Pacino a household name. The, Godfather also uses one of the best film editing techniques possible the work of Russian film editor Pudovkin as his editing technique of linkage of shots adds to the drama of The, Godfather. The scene of the baptism is linked just at the very same moment with the murder scene of enemies sure it is not the best pace but the scene is just perfect, and the drama of the events is increased through editing by linkage of shots by comparing death to a baptism both highly valued rituals in the mob. The, Godfather is the best from everything with the filming, acting, and the story. As you know The, Godfather will be the greatest classic forever.", "The Greatest Drama Ever": "The Godfather is the greatest Drama movie ever. This movie has the best plot, acting, and script of all movies ever made. I would recommend it to everyone. Also, Part II is good too.10 out of 10***** out of *****If you liked this movie, I would recommend \"Scarface\"", "Greatest mafia/family film ever": "This movie is incredible. It's the perfect story of family combined with the mafia. This is an amazing story of how power can corrupt and change people, and perfectly blends a balance of family into the mafia life. This movie truly shows the passage of time from the old ways of Vito corleone to the present day ways that do not suit him, and overall help mold the story and craft a beautiful and incredible movie that is one that everyone should see.", "absolutely a masterpiece": "Visuals, story, acting, directing, musics... this is basically the maximum directors can reach. shawshank redemption is a great movie but it's lacking in many such as visuals. If I meet an alien and they ask me what's the best movie you guys ever made, I would give them this and say second one is almost as good as the first one.", "The most over-rated movie of all time": "I will never, ever understand the love affiar people have with this movie. It is completely and utterly over-rated. Marlon Brando is not the god of an actor he and people make him out to be. Neither is Al Pachino for that matter. The acting is pretty stiff and unbelieveable. It was so freaking LONG. Ugh, I hate this movie.", "Over Rated...but if you want to jump on the band wagon": "Good solid movie, but far from the greatest movie or even greatest gangster movie of all time.Doesn't come close to Good Fellas or Casino.", "The Godfather might be the best movie ever made.": "What is there to say about The Godfather? That it is one of the best movies ever we all already know. What makes me like it so much? It was the movie that got me interested in the Movie industry. The movie that touched me so much i immediately knew that I wanted to make movies. Without this movie my life wouldn't look like it does today. But it isn't just me that this movie has affected. The whole world loves it and hails it as one of the best movies ever. Some (including me) even ranks it as THE best movie ever.Based on the Novel by Mario Puzo The Godfather, after a lot of problems during the shooting, was released in 1972 and was a great success. It was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best director Francis Ford Coppola, best Costumes, Best Supporting Actor: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Best Scrip based on previously published or produced material: Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola, Best Leading Actor: Marlon Brando and Best Movie, and won the three last mentioned. The movie got 3 sequel's, one released in 1974 and one in 1990, both directed by Coppola and written by Puzo.The acting is superb, Brando does the performance of his life. Al Pacino, who got his breakthrough in this movie, together with James Caan and Robert Duvall make perfect supporting actors. For examples take a look at Pacino in the restaurant scene, Caan when he is arguing with Tom Hagen, or Duvall when he delivers a horrible message to his father played by Brando. The writing is amazing, it is true to the amazing novel, a lot of the dialogue is taken directly from it. The directing is perfect, he sets the perfect feeling and mood for the movie and it's a mystery that he didn't win the Oscar for his directing.To conclude the review.The Godfather is a true masterpiece that no-one should miss, maybe it will change your life the way it changed mine? It is in my Opinion The best Motion Picture ever created.", "An Offer You Can't Refuse at All l!!": "The Godfather stands as the ultimate film in the Mafia and gangsters genre. I don't think it could have been improved in any way. A very interesting story, tremendous action scenes, great special effects, outstanding performances, strong direction, not a single sequence in excess, a good soundtrack, perfect timing, details carefully attended to, well defined characters, etc, etc.Marlon Brando's acting is perfect. In a cast with such top actors as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale -among many others- he clearly stands out. In fact, I had the feeling that their performances got even better -if possible- after Brando passes away and is out of the picture. Few Oscars for Best Actor have been awarded with more justice than the one Brando got in this one. Old timers -even for 1972- Sterling Hayden and Richard Conte both in short roles, are also a major nostalgic ingredient that raises the movie for those of us who saw them often on the screen through the 50's.No much more to say on this extraordinary film except perhaps that the two sequels that followed, great movies too, are one clear step below The Godfather.", "Copolla made us an offer we couldn't refuse": "\u00a8I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\u00a8 Many people consider the 70's to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least one of these films is on everybody's favorite movies list, and The Godfather is considered by many critics to be the best film of all time. Despite being nominated for eleven Oscars it only took home three (Best Picture, Best Performance by Marlon Brando, and Best Screenplay), just one more confirmation that a film can't be judged by the amount of awards it receives. The Godfather deserves much more. It is a movie that has transcended time and is enjoyed by everyone even decades after its first release. It was the first of its kind to portray the mafia from the inside and Coppola does a great job at romanticizing them and making us root for these criminals. How does he do it? By showing us the mafia as a strong and united family that supports each other; portraying the good guys as bad (there are corrupt cops and politicians); and making Vito Corleone stand out from the rest of the criminal families by not wanting to get involved in the drug business. He completely romanticizes the Corleone family and has us rooting for them from the very first scene thanks to a very intelligent script co-written with Mario Puzo who had previously written the bestselling novel. The script is amazing, the performances are great, and the direction from Coppola is just superb. All these elements combine perfectly to create this classic masterpiece.We are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the opening scene. He is head of one of the five New York Mafia families, and is attending his daughter's wedding. The wedding serves as a great excuse for Coppola to introduce all the characters because the entire family is gathered at the wedding. Vito is the Godfather for many of the people invited and he is treated with a great deal of respect. Tradition has it that no Sicilian can refuse requests on their daughter's wedding day, so Vito is attending some of his associates who are in need of favors. His sons Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale) are in the family business along with Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the family lawyer and consigliere, who was adopted by Vito at a very young age and is like a son to him as well. His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a World War II veteran shows up with his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) and is talking to her about his family. This conversation also serves as a perfect excuse to hear anecdotes about the family's criminal life and we are informed at once that Michael is the only one who is not involved in the family business. He has decided to stay away from the criminal lifestyle and is respected by his family. The entire plot takes place inside the world of the Corleone family and during a time where significant change begins to take place. Vito will have to make an important decision whether or not the family should protect a wealthy man named The Turk (Al Lettieri) who is trying to bring heroin into the city, or stick to the harmless gambling and alcohol business. He better think things carefully because his decision could have consequences.The Godfather is without a doubt a masterpiece and the cast has a great deal to do with it. James Caan and Robert Duvall had worked with Coppola in his previous film, The Rain People, and now they returned again with significant roles. They give great performances, but who really stands out in this movie is Marlon Brando who really becomes the Don. He gives one of the most memorable and all-time best movie performances in film history. Al Pacino hadn't made a significant movie before and the transformation he goes through in this film is incredible. His character is the one who experiences the most change if we recall his first appearance in the wedding and his last one in the Baptism scene. The screenplay is also very well written, the story completely hooks us from the very beginning, the characters are unforgettable, and Coppola just did a great job with the direction as he immersed us inside this world of crime. Of course we know that the mob world isn't anything like this and it has been romanticized by Hollywood, but Coppola managed to make us care for these criminals who actually don't see themselves as the villains. Nino Rota's score is just amazing and breathtaking; it helps build the suspense.The Baptism parallel action scene is one of the best ones in film history and has since been imitated endlessly in most action films, although never with the same effect. This is required viewing for everyone, one of the greatest achievements in film history.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/", "are you all out of your friggin minds?!?!?": "this movie was more boring than church! they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody! Michael Corleone is a little girly man! and that Sonny guy, no one intimidating is named Sonny! when he got blown to bits, i laughed....hard! Then there's Vito! What's with this guy? Does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth? why does he look like that? and what's with that name...Vito? who names thier son after a presidential command! it could only be one typed of people, hillbillies. Italian Mafia hillbillies. If you want a real good movie go see Santa With Muscles! he'll stop them Corleones!               1 out of 10", "Great of all the times": "It was like your building a high tower, and with the rules of construction to do something like that you must start with a solid tough base can hold the weight and levels. Godfather was written first with a unique way, that made you more interested to see the man's life, who can change you life, or even make your life in past with a word. For me it started with the DOP, with the amazing picture. Decoration, accessories, the site, and really the performance of all these stars together. Music was amazing and much matching the time of the movie, specially when you do your search of the music of that time. Last and least, the Director, who controlled all of his tools and made this great movie, i never felt bored of watching it.", "The Sicilian Way doesn't work in the Anglo-Saxon world": "If you lived in Sicily over the last 3,000 years you'd be pretty used to death and devastation by now. Sicily is bang smack in the middle of three prominent pre-Christian empires: the Greek post-Alexander Hellenistic empire, the Roman Empire and the Carthagian-Lavantine Empire. All three of them fought tooth and nail for 3 centuries to control Sicily. And I haven't mentioned yet the tyrants who used to rule Sicilian cities such as Syracuse, for whom the Greek engineer Archimedes worked. Then came the bully-boy, Normans, the Hapsburg Empire, Napoleon, Mussolini, the Nazis...oh where does it end?In other words, dying, or threatening others with death, is just something else to do on a Sunday afternoon in Sicily. The Sicilians also learnt how to barter with their masters of the day, and how to subjugate their own.Transfer all of this to a quiet neighbourhood of New York City, and it's like trusting King Kong into the city to clean the windows of the Empire State Building. The Godfather, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, shows how capable the Sicilian Mafia are at subduing the authorities to run their own profiteering rackets. But what's interesting is how after the Godfather was shown, how the authorities decided they had had enough of being manipulated by Sicilians. It wasn't long before they put every effort into suppressing these usurpers. The US authorities regained the role the Greeks, Romans and Carthagians had once held.Sicilian management is impressive, but not as impressive as good old Dutch-Anglo-Saxon mastery of all things profitable.A point of interest, the decapitation of the horse-head scene in this movie has its foundation in Roman Chariot racing on The Field Of Mars. One of the winning horses would be sacrificed, it's blood mixed with the bodies of the unborn children and its head nailed to the door of the Forum.", "Great Acting...": "Great Acting dreadful editing.\nIt's one of those must see movies but its just over rated.\nWatch the horse's head scene and see how badly edited it is...terrible seeing as everyone holds it in such high regard. Wobbly sound and out of focus cuts throughout. Coppola should be ashamed.", "The Greatest Film Ever Made": "There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, \"a film you can't refuse,\" etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion.From the legendary music (beautiful work by Nino Rota), to the cast and the acting (Brando, Pacino, and Caan), to the cinematography (brilliantly done by Gordon Willis, aka \"The Prince of Darkness\"), to the fascinating story and everything in between, there is nothing about this film that disappoints. It is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once in his or her lifetime, because the chances are that you will want to watch it again.", "Not a Fan": "Just didn't like it that much. Maybe I'll like it more when I'm older", "Just a Bit Too Long, but Still Pretty Great": "The Godfather has great scenes, classic characters, classic dialogue, and an amusing look into the Italian mafioso, but it's just a tad bit too long to be perfect, in my opinion as a new viewer. There were many scenes that were riveting and performances that were, at times, mesmerizing, but I just feel like it is a little overrated.It deserves its due credit, no doubt, for without it, so many great movies and tv shows inspired by it would have never been made, and the ground it therefore broke will always hold its place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Some scenes were just too drawn out, lengthened, or long-winded, and it can therefore become a little bit of a chore to watch and enjoy in one sitting, as good as it can be at certain points.I can see how when this came out in 1974, it was so popular and how it held up throughout the years to be considered one of the best movies ever made, but in my experience in watching other movies since then of this genre, I can list at least 5 I enjoy at least just as much if not more. Obviously, those films have been inspired by the Godfather so without it they wouldn't likely exist in the fashion that they do, but they are still better paced, more suspenseful at times, and just more entertaining overall.This doesn't mean that the Godfather isn't a classic and one of the best, but it is a matter of taste, and the Godfather still remains a movie I have to really be in the mood for to sit through. Certain scenes, or parts, of this epic hold up much more than others, while other parts and scenes can feel like a slog to sit through.8/10", "Exceeded my expectations": "Having been considered as the second greatest film in American Cinema, it was only second nature for me to get unrealistic high expectations. Save it until you gain an appreciation for films and a decent knowledge on how to distinguish a critic with a flop. Easily said, the film levelled up and even definitely crossed my expectations. I'll try and cover up what I found beautiful in this Francis ford adaptation of a 1969 novel revolving around one of the 5 greatest mafia families \"Carleone\".Starting with acting, I had only heard about Marlon Brando and how he is considered the greatest method actor, watching the film proved it undoubtedly. He was so original, so elegant in his role and I had to rewind some scenes specifically to listen to his dialogues with his son played by Al Pacino, who displayed yet another acting masterpiece. Only people like Al Pacino can make you see a transition of a man from a civilian to the lead don of the family.The cinematography struck with me throughout and some scenes, though not so important were directed so brilliantly, they managed to skip my beat. 2 main scenes that the movie covers in each halves, the murder of sozollo and Don Brazili are epitomes of cinematography.The movie is to savoured with each scene having its own flavour that patiently adds to its taste in the course. It might appear slow at times to those who are not in habit but it takes time for the plot to build and execute.", "This is a timeless classic (spoiler alert)": "Where do I start, I shall start with the script. First of all it is flawless. Vito Corleone is being forced to start dealing in drugs from another family. He decides drugs is a dirty business. Then he finds out it's a bad idea because he gets shot... don't worry he didn't die.. not yet anyway. Michael his son decides to take care of him while he is the hospital..this in turn leads Michael to decide he wants to be part of the family business. He gets a sucker punch from a crooked cop. That leads to him being mad so the family want revenge. He meets them at a restaurant and for those of you who have seen the film.. you know what happens. Anyway Michael goes into hiding in Italy.. he then comes back years later and marries his old sweat heart Kay. He is now the boss of the family.That tells you a lot about the plot but I think it is necessary to let you know what you are in for if you want to know about this film. I will now tell you about the cinematography it is gorgeous views on location in Italy out in the country.. also the look in new york all dark and sinister is great feel for the film.. I also love when they go to Las Vegas near the end and Michael wants to get a gaming license in Nevada. This is historically accurate in a sense that the mob made Las Vegas what you see today (the vision came from Bugsy Siegel.Now the music is the most amazing score I have ever come across in my life.. it is just fantastic.. You just have to watch the film to experience to this whole arc of family, loyalty and greed is one of the best portraits of the mafia you will ever see. In all this is a great film about family and how you can't get out of anything you love.. because once your in the mob there is no way out except you know what I love this film I rank it number 3 on my all time list.. and I just love it.. In fact I might go and watch it right now", "These are movies": "I grew up with films like this where the directors tried to show even though it's a man in crime that compromises can be made. Today's movies are terrifying.", "A masterpiece everyone should watch": "A masterpiece everyone should watch.

I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed.\nAnd the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid.\nThe only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them. And the mafia forced critics to praise this title by placing severed horse heads in their beds!", "One of the Greatest Movies of all time": "Yes I'm talking about The Godfather. It's one of the best motion pictures out there. I don't know if it should be at #1 on IMDPs top 250, but it definitely belongs in the top 10.So many stars. Al Pacino looks so young in this picture, as does James Caan with all the dark hair. They are two of three brothers in the Corleone family. Michael (Pacino) is the youngest and wants nothing to do with the family business, but Sonny (Caan) is easily angered and flies off the handle a lot, especially when it involves the abuse of his sister Connie (Talia Shire). They have another brother named Fredo (John Casale), but he does not have the leadership ability of the other two.Seeing over all of this is the late great Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. He is father too all the Corleone children and is also known as the Godfather by everybody else. He wields the most power, but that power is tested by four other powerful families who are also vying for what the Don has. This leads too much deceit and murder as the leaders of the other four families look to unseat Don Corleone from the top.This movie is 175 minutes long. Usually when I watch a drama that long, I am unable to get through it. Not so with the Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed, manages to keep you're interest throughout. Yes the film moves at a leisurely pace, but it is never boring. His directing is helped greatly by the actors who give some of their greatest performances ever. Marlon Brando definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.It is also interesting to watch how Pacino's character Michael changes as the film goes on through to the end. The sequence during the baptism is one of the best ever. I could say more about that, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen this great great film.Is this the single greatest movie of all time? I don't know about that, but it is definitely ONE of the best films of all time and deserved the Oscar for Best Picture in 1972. How can anybody think this movie is dull is beyond me.", "most overrated trilogy of all time": "I do not understand the big fuss about the Godfather trilogy OK yes the acting is top quality with brilliant performances from marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and even talia Shire is good but the film just drags the whole story is boring and the films just seem to go over the same things over and over again.I must admit that i am probably not the best person to review the godfather seeing as i don't really like gangster movies i didn't like Goodfellas either although i did like like the untouchables I believe people saying they love the godfather movies is simply because they have heard other people saying how good it is and think that in order to be considered a proper movie lover they have to like the godfathers.", "Tell me, it's just a joke.": "Godfather having score 9,1 and being 2nd best movie in IMDB? Yeah, good acting and plot twist, but it's just 6,0 movie. I don't think it's even a good movie.", "Award Winning Movie": "Watched it and I must say it had a very different story and marvelous dialogues that can create an impact.", "An Excellent Work of Movie-making by Copolla": "Some spoilers ahead.If you rent the \"Godfather\" DVD and listen to Copolla's comments about the production of the movie, it seems, from his view, that this film was plagued from the start with needling from Paramount studios. He was supposed to film \"The Godfather\" on the cheap with limited resources and constant input from the studio as to what he could do. He was regarded as such a bad director that he was almost fired from the task. His photo director (somebody with more knowledge of movie-making can correct me) thought Copolla didn't know what he was doing with what he thought were odd camera angles. It is the greatest irony of all that this movie became a timeless classic and propelled not only the fortunes of Paramount Studios in 1972, but launched the careers of Copolla as a director, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton as actors, and revived the once-glorious but then-moribund career of Marlon Brando (as you all know, he would later enter a second period of professional and personal decadence).Copolla was blessed with some of the best actors possible for this movie. Al Pacino was great as the mostly-taciturn but wily and cunning Michael Corleone, the true protagonist of the \"Godfather\" saga. I personally thought he, rather than Brando, should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Michael Caan gives his all as the bombastic and violent Sonny, Michael's older brother. Diane Keaton's performance has been called relatively weak, but I think this is not a fair assessment. She is very good as the naive and rather innocent girlfriend of Michael. Despite cries of nepotism in the casting decision, Talia Shire, Copolla's sister, does well as the battered and frantic sister of the Corleone clan. Robert Duvall is absolutely excellent as the \"brains\" of the Corleone family, Tom Hagen. Of course, Brando's performance is what will be most remembered of this movie, even though he is not on the screen as much as Pacino or Caan. He chose to be creative as the mumbling, aged, and rather stoic leader of the mob family. He is seldom over-the-top, which one may see as a relief to the stock character of the angry, vengeful gangster (Caan fulfills that role to the nines).Of course, overlooked are the performances of the secondary characters (whose names fail me, precisely because they never achieved fame and fortune on the scale of Pacino, Brando, Duvall, Keaton, or Caan). The guy who played \"The Turk\" Solozzo is a wonderful actor, and convincingly plays the character of the slimy drug-dealing antagonist. Sterling Hayden, who portrayed the loony \"Jack D. Ripper\" in \"Dr. Strangelove,\" also is quite good in his brief role as the evil police captain. I honestly can't be a fair judge of the characters of Fredo Corleone or the infamous henchman, Luca Brazi, as their time on the screen was rather brief. Still, for what it's worth, they did the best they could with what little screen time they had (John Cazale's Fedo would play a much more significant role in the \"Godfather\" sequel).The movie does have its fair amount of stylistic or memorable violence, but the screen in not chock full of nonstop guts and gore. Copolla's creativity as a director, and his use of stylistic devices, such as the frequent use of running children, dark, gloomy backgrounds, and music juxtaposed with violent images, makes this a highly entertaining movie. The characters are actually deep and make an impression on the viewer. This story is not Marlon's, but rather Pacino's, as we see his character grapple with his decision to join his family's criminal empire after his father is gunned down. We see him, based on his not-so-reluctant decision to murder the man responsible for shooting his father, Solozzo, slowly and credibly evolve from war hero who is not a member of the rackets, to being the ruthless head of the criminal empire. Copolla and Pacino keep us engaged in the story the whole time, with very few abrupt halts in the in the flow of the story.In short, this is the little film that, in spite of the huge problems it faced, payed off big in terms of box office receipts and critical acclaim. No movie buff should miss this masterpiece; average joes will love it too. Highly recommended.", "Taking the Cannoli": "This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definite film.", "Where to start": "Possibly one of the most overhyped movies I've ever watched, don't get me wrong that doesn't mean it's bad, I just think the reputation it holds is too big, I'm sure for when it came out it would be considered a masterpiece but now in 2021 I wouldn't say soI thought the performances were really good from most of the actors especially Brando. The story was fairly straight forward and there was little action, and the dialogue through the movie was quite blandThe movie had some stand out scenes which I won't spoil but honestly, if I had never watched this movie I wouldn't feel like I was missing out, 6/10.", "America's Closest Equivalent to a Tragic Italian Opera": "The opening title and scene of \"The Godfather\" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, \"I believe in America.\" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), \"the Godfather\" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of \"the Godfather\"), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.\"The Godfather\" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo \"the Turk\" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino \"Sonny\" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. \"The Godfather\" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. \"The Godfather\" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing.", "A bit outdated but still one of the best": "As I was about to watch the movie for the first time, almost 50 years after it's realese, I was expecting it to feel old and outdated. I was wrong. I mean, yes, some parts like image quality and visual effects could have been done better today but they're still not bad. Once the movie got started it found a really good pacing. And the fact that the movie felt so real just made it more tense and engaging. Now, I'm no expert in cinematography, but I felt like I was understanding what was happening in each scene and not once was I interupted by an unatrual tempo or poor cuts. I can definitly see why this is considered a classic and why people love it so much. The question is if the movie really deserves the second highest rating on IMDB?", "The Very Best Movie Made that Stars Marlon Brando, James Caan, Richard Castellano Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden...Ever...I Mean Ever": "So this movie is only number two out of 250 of the greatest movies ever made \u2013 whatsa-matta wid u?

OK, maybe I am going a little over the top, but before the Corleone family hit the cinemas, there really wasn't much spattering screens that defined what went on behind closed doors in 'The Cosa Nostra'; 'The Mafia'; 'The Family' or whatever these folks are known as. From the time Mario Puzo's pen first bled ink onto an empty pages, who would have guessed a masterpiece was about to be born. By the time Coppola's finishing touches on this creation, there could hardly be any doubt. This cinematographic brilliance known as, 'The Godfather' is a story hard to beat. There are those who say the movie is 'overrated'...to them...I say 'Go Watch \"The Birdman.\"' Haters are just going to hate like a bunch of crybaby haters. \"The Godfather's\", writing and script are superb; the acting and cast is outstanding and the saga's story-line is unmatched, what else is needed?

This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola's first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals.

A set of very good performances, highlighting that of Al Pacino, A plot fanstatic and interesting, also, jointly with a big scenes and phrases that will remain in the memory of a lot of people ; everything this make the work that left in the history\nto the great director Francis Ford Coppola.\nI like the realistic and dared of the sequences, being the scenes that more I liked, the of the head of horse, the first scene in the Godfather's ofice (Vito Corleone), and the of the murders of Michael in the restaurant. A Jewel", "A classic all the way": "The Godfather is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and the acting performances of Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny match that comment (Al Pacino is also good, but they have the edge).  The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike's evolution into a Mafia chief.The movie adds to the mystique of Brando as Godfather by not having him the center of action except for the first third of the movie, keeping you from that overdone feeling, and his major decisions are made in the wedding and shortly thereafter.  But oh, the classic scenes that resulted:  the friendship scene with Bonasera, the \"making an offer that he can't refuse\" line, the horse's head, the hand stabbing/strangling death of Luca Brasi. In the minority situation for an actor's being made to look older than he is, Brando is superb.  The cotton stuffing in his mouth works magnificently. He is The Godfather all the way -- way, way over Michael.  His wisdom and counsel are greater, and his majesty; Michael is a morose figure.Sonny is a formidable, memorable character (is he not much taller than James Caan is?), and his blatant id contrasts with Vito and Michael.  Tom Hagen is also played very well, by Robert Duvall, and other actors and actresses do a good job.  The hypocrisy crystallized by the Catholic mass setting is also excellent.  And hey, is not Sonny beating up his brother in law one of the very, very best fight scenes, even if one-sided?  What can I cite by comparison, Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris in The Way of the Dragon -- and yes, not sarcastically -- for what good fight scenes are so distinctive, intense and original, leaving such an imprint--what other very good fight scene also sticks out so much in one's mind over others?  You can't say, \"they're all the same\" for this one.  Sonny, like Vito and Mike, is part of American popular culture (well, I guess international, not to be chauvinistic).One of my friends, and perhaps yours, has said, \"I was rooting for the Corleones.\"  As one who likes many thrillers, action and suspense movies, and crime dramas, but does not like the overly depressing subject matter and sleazy characters and sometimes tortuous, overcomplicated plots that characterize the mid-70s onward (Pulp Fiction, Grifters, etc.), I note that this is unfortunately a forerunner of these, altho not hard to follow.  But I think it was the Godfather Part II that really was the precursor, and II's quality pales in comparison to I's (I do not care what others think), and much more than other sequels.  Because the genius of The Godfather I was taking such sordid subject matter and making it so entertaining, so much a part of our consciousness, and leaving us with such positive feeling when we think about it.  I do not believe this is the case for many later movies to which its influence can be traced.", "I believe in America": "This is by far the greatest movie of all time. The only bad thing I can say about this film is that I now have to compare every film I see to it and it is never close. The incredible acting and directing are all the best but it is the story that catches you and doesn't let go. The is a movie about family. Honestly is you replace Mafia with domestic violence, alcoholism, anything it would still work. I still to this day have to look over my shoulder whenever I eat an orange. I honestly think this will be one of the only movies that will never be remade due to the world exploding as a result. I love this movie and encourage all I meet to watch it again and again. Whens the last time you invited me over for coffee?", "The Godfather : The Greatest Achievement in Cinematic History": "The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.", "Because Spielberg said so.": "What i wanted to say has already been said countless times. Ill make this short. First off i love the Godfather. This is on my 10 favorite films of all time. We all know its top 3 material but when Steven Spielberg claims to have almost retired after seeing this movie because he feared that he could never make a movie of the same magnitude as the Godfather, thats saying something coming from arguably the best film maker of the last 25 years. I wanna say that this is the best film in history but thats really a matter of ones opinion and taste. Whether its better or worse than citizen Kane is your opinion, mine goes with the Godfather. Not that Citizen Kane is far off but what are we judging on here, The films impact, or the Film it self. Citizen is judged by its impact of every film that came after it. As a film it self, I don't feel it matches up to the Godfather nor gone with the wind or Schindlers list Given the difference in eras that they were all made. But hey, thats just me. Tons of Top directors believe that the Godfather is probably the greatest. M Night Shyamalan, Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Thats some good Company there. I believe the experts.", "One of the Greatest Films of All-Time": "One of the best films ever. After winning an Oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance.Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilian?s pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims.Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the \"business\" but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael.Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don.The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the \"weak\" one within the family.Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections.The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him.Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the \"Godfather\" in two different ways.This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off.", "Utimately Great": "''The Godfather'' is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ''Don't ever take sides against the family.'' It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.''I went to the police, like a good American,'' the man says. The Godfather's reply will underpin the entire movie: ''Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.'' As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of film-making: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.The screenplay of ''The Godfather'' follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told ''someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .'' and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito's desire to spare his wife the sight of their son's maimed body. And notice how a woman's ''mistaken'' phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It's done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out.", "Among the Best Films of all time and rightfully so...": "First seeing The Godfather you'll probably have a good idea of what it is about a Mafia family.It is never mentioned as a Mafia film,and I do not believe the word Mafia is used in the film.For the Corleone family its a part of their business and lives.We know what the Corleone's are doing is evil and wrong,but The Godfather isn't told from our point of few it is told from the point of few of The Corleone family.With understanding this we are able to understand the characters more,and have sympathy for them.Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is a respectable man,he is offered to get into the drug business and he says it is wrong.The audience of course know that Vito is a cold hearted killer,but he comes across as a sad man.A crucial establishing scene in the beginning of the movie,has an undertaker asking Vito for justice,Vito says that he will receive it,but he will ask him a favor in the future.Vito is gunned down and is sick the rest of his life,his son Sanito \"Sonny\" Corleone takes his Father's place.Sonny is betrayed and gunned down in a violent war.A sad Vito comes in to the Undertaker asking his favor,clean up his body so his mother doesn't have to seem him like this.The story of The Godfather does not belong to Vito Corleone though he only plays a part in it.The Godfather is the story of the transfer of Vito's empire to his other son Michael.Michael is actually a decent guy,he has a girlfriend he plans to wed,and is a war hero.Michael in tears tells his Father he will be there for him next to his hospital bed.Michael kills the men who set-up his father.Vito even tells Michael he didn't want a life of crime for him,he wanted him to become something more.Through the course of the movie Michael becomes a man possibly worse than his father,he is a tragic figure you feel for.The Godfather is brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola.It is arguably the best directed film of all time.It has a dark feel to it.The acting is brilliant too,there is no bad performance in this film.The Godfather is a must see,for any fan of movies.If you could only place one film to represent the 20th Century and movies,The Godfather would probably be that film.A Very High 10/10", "Oh My Godfather!": "I went into this film with a chip on my shoulder that was determined not to like it and I was only watching it in order to scratch it off of my film poster. I don't like gangster films really, glorifying violence and illegal activities has never been in my wheelhouse, but I have to say that this one was so well made, so well acted and such a good story that I couldn't help but enjoy it.It starts out with a great pace that takes you through things day by day, which it slightly loses towards the end, when suddenly we are skipping ahead months or years at a time and with a much slower feel to the action, but I was already sold on the film as a whole, so I didn't mind too much at all.It's obvious why it appears on every top films list I've ever come across. Yes, you could trim about 15 minutes off of it, but at what cost, I don't think that there is anything in this film that shouldn't be there, the perspective shots and set ups are all important I feel.\nThe director, editor and crew in general have all done a fantastic job to bring this Mafioso story to life with a careful and considerate vision.What I would call the gross bits aren't so offensive to put me off my tiramisu and the bad language is part and parcel, without being overused to prove how bad they are.It's a shame to see the sweeter and more innocent Michael slowly get drawn in to the trouble, but you can see why he finds that path and that's what makes the story interesting.The actors all give great performances. Mother thought that Robert Duvall in particular was outstanding for giving us a side of him that we don't see that often in his other roles, which can sometimes be a bit more quirky and I have to say that I agree with the old grotbags.However, I have always had a thing about Mr Brando that I just can't ignore (If I ever get a time machine, you'll find me in his changing room for 'Streetcar Named Desire'). I thought he was fantastic, especially as he gets older towards the end of the film. I didn't quite understand why he looked like he'd been to the dentist and forgotten to take the cotton wool out though? I'm not sure it added anything, except to add a talking point or a gimmick. Were they trying to make jowls where there were none or was it an old wives tale way of trying to clear his obviously congested sinuses? Whatever it was, he was superb.Al gave a great performance too, surely paving the way to his lead role in 'Scarface'.\nI was also incredibly surprised to find myself looking at James Caan with bedroom eyes. My only references to him previously have been 'Elf' and 'Misery', so to see him so youthful and handsome was a pleasant change.If you like gangster/mobster films then this one is a sure win for you, but even if you don't generally like them you should give it a go.I have Part II lined up to watch in the next few days. It will be interesting to see where it goes with the fabulous Robert De Niro on board too.", "good very happy": "One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.", "Weak compared to the book": "***Spoilers Ahead***I read the book by Puzo before I saw the movie made out of it. I loved The Godfather in writing. I thought the characters were well thought out and portrayed. When I rented the movie, I knew that there is no way to give the whole story in four hours and make it interesting so I looked for characters and the way they were illustrated.  I looked for the way relationships were passed on to the viewer compared how it was done in the book and after all this I was very disappointed. I can forgive the movie for omitting histories about people like Luca Brasi and Al Neri. I can even forgive them for not working more with Johnny Fontane even though it was a great story that tied in well with the portrayal of Don's relationship with his Godson and how he expected to be repaid by people close to him. The movie skipped characters like Nino, Kay's parents and her background, the doctor and several others, but after all, the movie is not supposed to be a book word for word. The Godfather had great cinematography. The scenes were beautifully picked and shot. My favorite is at the end when Michael stands as Godfather to his nephew and people are getting shot all around, that was amazing. The music was cheesy most of the time, but if that was my main complaint, I could still call this movie to be great. What appalled me beyond belief is the horrible portrayal of Michael and his relationship with Kay (unfortunately it only gets worse in the 2nd movie) and complete lack of the mother's presence in the movie. Her and Kay develop a relationship. Kay becomes super Catholic and goes to church with her every morning. She ran away from Michael with his kids at some point because she was angry with him. And Michael was patient and never lost his temper with his wife. However, he was also very proud and when he returned from Cicily he did not go to her because did not expect to find her still waiting for him. And the movie failed to illustrate how much Tom Hagen was an outsider to the family. The Don lost some of his power because of Tom and that is why Michael removed him from the post. I thought that Sonny was portrayed well as were Connie and Carlo. I thought that oranges as a foreshadowing device was a great idea. The ironies illustrated in the movie like the beginning of a movie with \"I believe in America\" are all good things that made this movie stronger. However, it lacks depth and complexity. I don't understand how one can understand what is going on in this movie without reading the book first.\nThis movie is considered to be America's best and that should be left on its conscience.", "Wowzers! Unoriginal?": "I got a laugh from the people who found this film to be unoriginal, lukewarm, or not up to the standards of other mob films or tv shows.  \"The Godfather\" is the grand daddy of them all! Coppola and Puzo practically invented the genre of \"mafiosi as Shakespeare\".  Given how subsequent films and tv shows have run with these themes (even done them to death) most of what you're left with in this film is acting and craftsmanship.  But man o man.  It doesn't get better.  \"Shawshenk Redemption\", in contrast, was a good installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame.", "Vito Corleone ain't gonna win Father of the Year": "Very few movie dads come off worse than Vito Corleone. As he postures and pretends to be a man of honor and a man who loves his family, he's all the time setting in motion the elements that will wound or destroy his kids. No man is in the Mafia unless he's just a greedy SOB. So, Don Corleone mortgages his children's future at a very high interest rate in order to become a multimillionaire off of bootlegging, labor-union corruption, gambling and loan-sharking. One son is horribly murdered by a thousand bullets, his only daughter, Connie, is eventually left an embittered and tragic widow before she turns 25, his grandson by Connie is left orphaned thanks to in-house vengeance, his eldest son is corrupted and eventually under the mob thumb in Vegas and his idealistic youngest boy is overwhelmed by the old Mafia game and eventually seizes headship of The Commission by committing one of the worst mass-murders in New York history. Don Vito said in the third scene of this movie, \"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.\" He should have focused on demonstrating values to his family, not just spending all that time with them.", "Execlent movie but short changed the book": "This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many \"books\"(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made.", "The greatest film ever made next to the sequel.": "Much of my male wisdom and philosophy on life is derived from THE GODFATHER. It is one of the most powerful, poetic, dramatic, stories in history, elevated from pulp to high art by a brilliant ensemble cast, mythical direction and a riveting script.  Brando is forever enshrined by his performance as Don Vito head of the powerful Corleone crime family.  Al Pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the Don's son Michael, who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene.  It is a comment on the fallibility of the American dream.  How every good boy has the capacity for bad.  Every character resonates with authenticity.   Every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family.  THE GODFATHER above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family.  It is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll.  When loyalty was ensured through family connections, and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government.  A film that is truly epic in scope, and all encompassing in wisdom.  A masterpiece.", "What are the filmmakers driving at?": "What is the point of this movie? Okay, I am not thick-headed or something, in fact I am an avid movie follower and have come to appreciate some fine movies because that was what they were- fine! But sadly this movie failed to inspire me. Agreed not all movies need to but the fact that the movie glorifies things like \"killing\", \"gambling\", and a dozen other vices but proudly considers prostitution as evil, point to the epic hypocrisy therein...Right from the word go, the movie moves insipidly leaving you corrupted and uneasy. The so-called crime lord has principles! Well if you as a filmmaker are going to make a crime lord who deserves nothing but the greatest of the punishments possible, as some kind of a hero on screen; the youth of today will become influenced by the wrong notion and begin to imagine themselves in the same position- as heroes committing a great act in their waywardness. The movie fails on all counts to warn the audience of these things.And as for the story it is not that great either. No offense to Mario Puzo fans, but talking of the movie I think the subject could have been tackled more intelligently, cinematically...And as for those who go with the flow and praise The Godfather even though in their hearts, they don't see the movie as that great, take a stand and be truthful!A better movie than this which handles crime and successfully drives home the motives of gangsters in the most humane way, is \"Once upon a time in Mumbai\", a Bollywood movie. You should check it out for its very strong performances.", "I lived the life hence my score!": "I was actually married to someone in the same position when we went to see the Godfather and I'm afraid my review is marred by my experience. So much of the movie was ridiculous while some parts were accurate. I didn't enjoy watching this due to being involved in what was being glamorised on the big screen.. I found the mafia ISNT the highly regarded organisation it claims to be. I was told over and over they never hurt the innocent and there is a lot of honour in the mafia which I discovered is untrue. The backstabbing and lying even among family members is shocking and there is no honour.. absolutely none!", "Excellent Execution.": "It's a beautifully made movie. Not just because of the subtle direction by Francis Coppola but because of the production design (Dean Tavoularis) and photography (Gordon Willis). Everything seems to lend itself to the impact of the story, which describes the replacement of Marlon Brando's Mafia chief by his youngest son, Al Pacino. Make up is expertly handled. Pacino's broken cheek is properly swollen and blue and fades gradually, providing the viewer with a kind of cinematic clock telling the passage of time. Nino Rota's score is tops. During the baptism scene, which takes place in a church, the organ hums an apt courtly tune. Then, as the film cross cuts between ritualized religion and ritualized homicide, the organ insensibly becomes darker and more ominous.These departments seldom get enough credit -- except recently in CGI extravaganza's. The more nuanced touches in furnishings, wardrobe, shadows and the like generally go unrewarded by the public. But this film, and a few others like it (\"Shane\", \"Verdict\") wouldn't be what they are if they'd been clumsily handled.Brando has given maybe four nearly perfect performances and this is one of them. To appreciate it we have to skip over all his failed attempts to extend his range, the dancing bookmaker, the comic Oriental sidekick. The Don Corleone we see doesn't radiate power so much as fatigue. Al Pacino is transformed from a smiling lad, happy to be home from the war, to a dispassionate kingpin of crime at the end, a bit too abruptly. Sterling Hayden, as the corrupt Irish cop, has invested this much in a role only once before, in \"Dr. Strangelove.\" Example: After smashing Pacino's face with one blow of his oversized fist, Hayden turns away, winces with self control and pounds his fist into the night-time air.It's hard to imagine how Coppola could have improved on his direction of this tragic tale. With the exception of the violent scenes, of which there are many, maybe too many, the film's texture is smooth and understated. Example: A baker shows up at the hospital just before some would-be assassins arrive and Pacino talks this innocent man into posing as a gunman. Not a word from the baker. He does what he's told. And when it's safe, he tries to light a cigarette but his hands are shaking so badly that Pacino has to light it for him.The women don't have much to do. Diane Keaton as the Shiksa is puzzled but hopeful. Talia Shire as the abused wife is hysterical. Mamma Corleone is a revered background figure who rarely shows up.That's the good stuff -- and it's very good indeed.The bad stuff, I'm not sure about. The Corleone family, like the other five families in New York, are making a fortune. That's evident from their digs, their cars, their raw silk suits. But what business are they in? That's one of the things Keaton is curious about. The businesses are only alluded to twice -- \" the gambling, the liquor, even the women.\" Well, what's so bad about that? Who gives a damn about illegal gambling, smuggled liquor, or escort services? Nobody. Drugs are brought in towards the end, but only dealt with discretely. We never sell it around schools, it must be strictly controlled, and let the darkies up in Harlem have it and \"kill their souls.\" The words \"extortion,\" \"protection racket,\" and \"Mafia\" are never used. This is a pretty rotten business they're in. And if Marlon Brando' Don was a kind of community organizer, Al Pacino's Don is a ruthless hypocrite. In fact, he's a lying, murdering, thief. While he is solemnly taking his oath as godfather to his nephew, his minions are out in the streets slaughtering rivals wholesale -- and in the most graphic way.\"Never ask me about my business,\" he tells his wife. And one hopes she never does, unless she wants to wind up \"sleeping with the fishes.\"", "One of the best movies ever.": "For years, I never wanted to see The Godfather because something always told me it was slightly overrated. Film fanatics have praised The Godfather (and it's sequel) as two of the best films ever made, and I could just never understand what could be so good about it. So, last year, I felt it was time to finally give the trilogy a go. And you know what? Everyone truly is right. It really is one of the best films ever made.The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. The Corleone's are a Sicilian family involved in organized crime. When the Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning role)is shot in the streets (he lives), he asks his son Michael (Al Pacino, in an Oscar nominated role) to take over the family business. Michael never wanted to be in the family business. He always dreamed of just staying away from it, and living a peaceful life with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton). But once he takes on the role of the Don, he realizes that there is no going back, and nothing can ever be the same.The Godfather is a film that mainly focuses on two main subjects: family and betrayal. Both subjects are depicted beautifully. Director Francis Ford Coppola and his screenwriter Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel) have made what is easily the best movie about family ever made. But yet they take the family movie to a whole new level.The Godfather is three hours of pure perfection. Every actor here nails it, especially Brando. Brando is an actor that we beg to see more of. Even though the film mainly focuses on Pacino's character, it is obviously Brando's show. But even though it is Brando's show, it is also sort of everyone's show. Hell, it could even be considered James Caan's show, because while he is in it, he steals the show.The Godfather is easily one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films. Yes, it is an amazing movie, and it isn't even his best movie. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I can't quite say it's my favorite movie ever, but it is certainly up there somewhere. It truly deserved best picture, and screenplay. But why the hell didn't it win best director? That Oscar had FFC's written all over it. If you haven't seen it, see it before you die.A+", "The movie to conquer all movies": "Movies are made for a lot of reasons and can inflict human emotions to the audience. Some tend to be classics because a lot of people enjoyed the movie and raved about it. Others don't go far to be known. In my opinion, movies that are classics are going to stay for a long time. Movies that don't fare well will be forgotten. But, what about movies like The Godfather? Is that movie is going to be around for a long time? Absolutely. Is it for all generations to see? Absolutely. Without a doubt, The Godfather is the leader to all of the great movies. The movie is adapted from Mario Puzo's best-seller and it tells the story of a family. Vito Corleone is the head of his family. He is also the head of the family's business. His family deals with different situations that are dealt with in their own style and fashion. In other words, they are the Mafia. When Vito's son comes home from the war, he decides on his own behalf to not get involved in his family's business. Michael Corleone, Vito's son, decides to live his own life while his family deals with their own problems. But, when one of Vito's sons, Sonny, played by James Caan, is killed during a mob hit, Vito decides to take revenge against the people who killed his son. Meanwhile, Michael becomes aware of his surroundings and starts to see a downfall of his father's empire. His father is severely injured in the streets after being gunned down and Michael starts to wonder who's going to watch over the family. In other words, who's going to be the next godfather? As the movie progresses, I was suddenly starting to see a change being done to the movie and also to the movie industry. This rise and fall story is told very beautifully and is directed with a focused look at a world where family sticks together and carry out their jobs and fall down and suffer the consequences. This movie has a lot in store and has a lot of feeling about the underworld of the mafia. We even see that even though Michael does become who he is in the end, we know that for a fact that the choice was one that couldn't be refused. The Godfather is a film to be hailed. It's portrayal of the Italian mob is not stereotypical. Instead, the movie focuses on a family that is doused with honor, pride, lust and life. People do get hurt in these drastic situations and those wounds do hurt in a way that you've never felt before. For me, this film speaks louder than the words that are being said. It is more than a gangster movie. It is what the movies are meant to do, which is entertain us at its best and greatest. The performances by Marlon Brando is excellent. He really leads a very well-casted movie that include Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall, as the family lawyer, who is Irish and the supporting role of Diana Keaton as Pacino's love interest. All of the acting in The Godfather is phenomenal. This is the movie that made Al Pacino a star. He is that great of a legendary actor to star as Michael. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that in several interviews involving his film, he said that The Godfather was the hardest film to make. With a ballooning budget and a casting problem with the role of Vito Corleone, Coppola suffered most of the time and even was afraid he'll lose his job. In my opinion, he should be proud of the film he made. Even though it was troubling to make, in the end, it paid off. Not only being in the top 10 grossing films of 1972, but also allowing us to see a movie that's worth watching and worth looking at. It is also fill with style and power that in the end, we are starving to see it again. The Godfather took home 3 Oscars, including Best Picture and spawned 2 sequels. As a movie buff, all I can say is that The Godfather leads behind other classic movies like Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca. Like those 3 other movies, it's the power and story-telling that grabs us out of the movie theater and puts us into the spotlight with well-scripted characters and various stories that emerged out of the family. The sheer critical praise of The Godfather continues to seen and even though it's been 41 years since the film's release, this film isn't going to die. The epic scope and vision of this underworld is going to live on and keep this classic pumping. The Godfather is the best film of 1972 and yet, one of the greatest movies of all time. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.", "Even the cat acts well lmao": "The best movie I've ever seen in my life and, of course, the best movie in the world,\nMarlon Brando is just excellent as The Godfather, the performances of the whole actors are beautiful. Even the extras acts good(including the cat lmao)\nI think this movie is the example of \"how to do the best movie in the history\". The best movie, just that.", "Must watch for every movie lover.": "One of the best movies based on the underworld. The story holds you until the end. The terrific performance of the actors are very much convincing. Overall, it's a must-watch for every movie lover.", "The Epitome of Cinematic Perfection": "Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of the best films in history, and definitely the most iconic. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as its lead characters, it is much more than just a mafia film. It delves deep into society and family. It explores the corruption of government, the power the mafia had at the time, and doesn't hold back to portray the brutal life of the Corleone family. It tells a tragic story of how the well-mannered Michael Corleone turns into a cold-blooded murderer and eventually a kingpin. Throughout its long runtime, it gives you no time to rest, throwing twist after twist, and by the time credits start rolling, you will be rooted to your seat, your jaw wide open. Its storytelling is flawless, its characters are multi-layered and you care about them, especially Vito and Michael, who are essentially bad individuals.\nThis is more than a movie, it is an epic, a journey, an observation of how great men descent into the world of crime. If you have not seen this yet, do so right now. You will never be able to look at other films the same way ever again.", "This movie never getting old.": "This isn't just a crafted gangster film also family portrait too. An inspirational movie to generation to generation of actors, directors, producers & screenwriters.", "An excellent cult piece": "A cult that hosts the most beautiful and special scenes in the history of cinema. Perhaps the most impressive film in the history of cinema. It immerses you in the movie with its music and realistic scenes.", "Flawless, exciting... unique.": "The year is 1970. F.F. Coppola has just directed \"The Rain People\" (1969), a good, but not great, movie, starring R. Duval and James Caan. Coppola is then offered to direct the Mario Puzzo best-seller, \"The Godfather\". Coppola accepts, but has his own suggestions for the leading roles: Marlon Brando shall incarnate Vito Corleone -the \"godfather\", while an unknown actor, someone called Al Pacino, is suggested for the most important role in the film; he'll play Michael Corleone, the second son of Vito, the soon-to-be godfather. Paramount isn't very keen of either suggestions. They'd prefer George C. Scott for the leading part and Dustin Hoffmann or Jack Nicholson for the role of Michael. Pacino is discarded for the unforgivable crime of being \"a midget\". Brando, the unconventional \"bad boy\", is out of question. Coppola finally got his way. Thankfully.Also starring are former collaborators -see the \"Rain People\"- R. Duval and James Caan, while there are also a few Coppola-family members contributing: Talia Shire, Coppola's sister, stars and Carmine Coppola, Francis' father, writes the music, along with long-time Fellini collaborator, Nino Rota. Sophia Coppola, the director's daughter, also known as a director herself, makes also a snapshot in the movie -she's the girl who's being baptized at the end of the film.These were only unnecessary information. The point lies elsewhere: \"The Godfather\" is probably the best American movie of all times. It's not the flawless cinematography, nor the mesmerizing acting by all the actors. And it's not the simply breath-taking music score, or the amazing plot. It's the summary of all the above. It may sound childish, but I will say it: Everyone did their job splendidly.To start with, the plot is fascinating. Brando is the mafia godfather, a Shakespearian figure, who dances on the edge of life and death and has to pay. It's notable, that the audience feels sorry and sympathy for him, although he is a sheer killer. \"We're not butchers, despite what this undertaker thinks\", implies Vito in the beginning of the film. Simply brilliant: A killer is thought to be one by an undertaker. Does it get any better? Apparently, yes. Vito is shot nearly dead by a rival family and Michael appears on the screen. Revenge, business, interest and death are the ingredients of the rest of the film.Secondly, the acting is just sublime. Brando makes the best performance in his career -it's a draw with \"Apocalypse Now\". Caan is excellent, so's Duval. But the key-performance is the one from Pacino. He tries to evolve from a shy-idealist-soldier-boy to a coldblooded-evil-adult. And he succeeds. It's simply one of the very great performances ever.Thirdly, the music can't get any better. Written in the motives of Fellini's movies, Rota did his best. Can't get bettered.Finally, and most importantly, the cinematography stands above any criticism. There are so many memorable scenes: Brando's shooting, the wedding sequence, the Turk's murder by Pacino -this one's the key-scene of the film, the Sicily sequence, the scene in the garden between Vito and Michael, the \"double\" baptism, followed by the murders etc.It lasts more then two-and-a-half hours. But it doesn't show. It's so unique, so fascinating, that you're gonna ask for more. Are you searching for a flawless film? Stop searching; you're in the right place. Highly, no, hugely recommended.Thank you.", "MASTERPIECE.": "It's incredible how Coppola directed this film, every shot in this movie is well thought and incredibly executed. The script is basically perfect in every aspect. Cinematography is amazing as well, and the performances are impeccable. And off course the soundtrack is a character on his own. A true masterpiece.", "One of the Greatest Films of All Time": "I'll admit the movie at first was very boring, but after watching again, I fell in love with it. A movie that is really flawless. Incredible Story (I WON'T REVEAL ANY OF IT), Great Directing, Very Intense and deep scenes throughout the film, great music, the stage is very well set (this takes place in the 1940s, it was filmed in 1972 and it was almost as if it was filmed in the 1940s). And the most important of all is the acting, THIS MOVIE HAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. To start, James Caan places as \"Sunny Corleone\", Robert Duvall as \"Tom Hagen\" (you may also know him from \"Apocalypse Now\"), The Legendary Al Pacino as \"Michael Corleone\" puts up a hell of a show. And to top of it all was perhaps the Greatest Actor of All Time behind Humphrey Bogart: Marlon Brando as \"Vito Corleone\" Brando was the old actor, but still put up a great show starting a franchise that became one of the greatest films of all time. The film won Best Picture (despite being an R rated film), and Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Lead Role. I'd probably start a debate just saying it's the greatest film of all time, but I'm going to do it anyway, THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME, everything is perfect in this film. You are not educated in Filmographically if you haven't seen this movie. If this movie didn't exist, the movies nowadays would be 100% different than what they are now. Period.", "The Godfather does not come close to Goodfellas (Spoilers)": "I am not able to discern much greatness here. Very slow to start it takes too much time to set the mood with period sets and as a consequence does not have the time to make us get into the characters, raise our interest for them. For a long time it is not really clear on which of the main characters the movie really focuses and we thus cannot invest ourselves in one of them, but have to watch in a rather detached way the \"epic story\" of an entire family, their general mafia business dealings which to me at least are nothing new. The focus on Michael which comes only after some time is achieved with a scene where as a loving son he saves his father, then with a rather inexplicable revenge act which starts an all out gang war, and finally with a cartoonish love story which is also an exploitation device: the one full frontal nudity shot is totally out of place, and I am not against sex on film in general (the scene is however a direct adoption of Mario Puzo's pulp style, so it's at least true to the original material). All this is hardly above cliche. Compare this to Goodfellas, where Martin Scorsese lets us into the head of one single gangster. By concentrating on three friends and their ascent in the mob, the viewer is guided in an effective and engaging way. The exhilaration, the rewards, the madness, the brutality, the arrogance, the anxiety of the mob life are all presented and, using voice over, explained. The viewer gets to understand the motivation of the characters in depth. That Scorsese is a much more effective director than Coppola can be seen from a direct comparison of two scenes. In The Godfather, Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo when he discovers that Carlo beats his wife. This is done in a somewhat drawn out, brutal but standard style, filmed from a relatively static viewpoint at a distance. The average viewer having witnessed hundreds of movie-brawls is most unimpressed. In Goodfellas, Henry knocks down the guy who was harassing his girlfriend in a very similar scene. However, set in a peaceful neighborhood and done in a much faster editing style, the violence comes as a shock and it's over before it has begun. When Henry concludes the encounter with a death threat and Karen in voice-over talks about how she gets excited by the behavior of her boy friend, Scorsese has created a lasting impression. Or, as another example, compare how food is treated, an obvious fetish for the Italian-Americans as portrayed in movies. Coppola treats us to an recipe explained on-screen by Clemenza and a few shots of dining tables and dishes full of food. Scorsese however continuously gives us close-ups of frying pans and people cooking and amassing foodstuffs, and, in the narration of the last day before Henry is arrested, makes the stirring of the tomato sauce into the calm eye of the storm. This is just a masterful characterization, giving 'flesh' to the topic and guaranteeing to leave everybody hungry. The Godfather does have it's moments, of course, and it has a formidable cast. The problem is that they only have a pulp novel to play with, whereas in Goodfellas it's the true autobiographic material of a real life gangster.\nFinally, I want to add that The Godfather is certainly not the ultimate masterpiece for Coppola. From a directorial standpoint he has achieved much much more with Apocalypse Now. In the end, however, Martin Scorsese is still a better director by far.", "The innocent son of the don of a mafia gets hooked in the family business when the father gets crittically wounded.": "The Godfather is the best movie ever, also the best adaptation from a book, Francis Ford Coppola did a great job on knowing what to put in, and what to put out. I would like to point out that characters in the book have the last names of some of the people part of the movie, Anthony Coppola is one character obviously the relation is with Francis Ford Coppola, I forgot the first name but there was a Mancini as one character, the relation is the guy who did the them song's name is Henry Mancini. Also the producer did a great job of picking all Italian people, I heard somewhere that they almost picked Robert Redford for the job as Michael Corleone, somewhere on television, once I heard this I new it was one of the worst picks ever, I don't know how the producer could've picked that but the rest of the cast is tremendous. This is also great because nobody thought of the mafia underworld idea until Mario Puzo came out with the book, nobody knew how to make the book into the movie, and some people didn't think of making the book into the movie. A lot of people say the second one is better than the first, I would say no on that, because there's nothing better than the oringinal, the second one was excellent, but not as good as the first because it was as entertaining as the first, the things that almost bored me was the family situations, family crisis, not a lot of action, and shooting. In the first one the kills were more out of no where, and surprising me, like when the man went to take a leak, and on the way back the guy killed the guy, a brilliant set up. This movie is tremendous and wonder why would anybody give it a one, because I saw on the voting charts there was a 1.6, for the ones, maybe they don't recognize the excellence, and art of this movie, but I would like to say the movie is brilliant, I gave it a 10, and I hope you do to.", "Best Film All Time": "One never knows when one will be bested. Did Citizen Kane anticipate Vito Corleone popping a couple of cotton buds in his cheeks and changing cinema forever? With the possible acceptation of Shawshank, the characters, cinematography, screenplay et al have not been surpassed and it is unlikely they ever will be. If you haven't seen it you're a missing out. It defines the term classic. It is timeless and everlastingly relevant. We'll still be watching this film in six hundred years. It's the Mona Lisa of Movies. The Beethoven of Film.", "Best movie of all time": "This movie really did change my life. It was absolutely breathtaking and so complete in film quality. I have never seen so flimed and completed so well and there was a near perfect movie of that type, it would be the Godfather. You look at the cast of people in this movie and these people were made stars because of this movie or already were stars; Al Pacino,James Caan, Marlon Brando, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and the list goes on. The storyline was unbelievable with a plot that was constantly evolving and the commitment to accuracy and staying true to Puzo's novel written years earlier. People actually spoke Italian in this movie and you really felt that they were their characters because they sold it to you that well. I still look at Brando, Caan and Pacino and say, \"Your the Godfather who started it all, your Sonny with rage and ferocity and Pacino is the up and coming Godfather who is the most sinister and clever Godfather there ever was.\"", "Perfect in every sense of the word.": "I've seen this movie a dozen times and still believe it is by far the best movie ever made.  From the opening sequence where you make the acquaintance of the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his family to the ending scene where Michael Corleone becomes Don Michael Corleone, the new godfather, the movie stays perfect.Marlon Brando is excellent as Vito Corleone (he won an Oscar for his performance) and Pacino and Caan are great as his sons who have two opposite characters, Pacino is practical and Caan is radical.  However, I believe Robert Duvall is the one who distinguishes himself the most as Pacino's and Caan's adopted brother and lawyer of the family.Many of my favorite scenes of all-time are included in this gem (especially the scene where Michael kills Solottzo and Captain Macluskey in the restaurant).  An absolute must-see at any costs.", "Marlon Brandon is amazing": "The best part of all parts.. I really loved it\nMarlon Brandon worth the oscar", "Best Recommended": "Can't stop watching and playing this best action scene on my PS3.", "Nice movie": "Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.", "Greatest of all time they said": "Already cited as one of the greatest of all time, but it's certainly not in my book. the movie is long. it features unnecessary scenes and the film would be as it is without them, esp the wedding scene at the beginning, it ran too long almost to the point of being annoying. the character of Micheal is pathetic, he left Kay, his lover and went into exile and then got married to some native girl and then she died, he then came home and asked Kay to marry without an remorse and in the most unconvincing way possible. he barely shows any emotion throughout the movie even the Godfather who has been in the business his whole life is not as stiff as he is.I like the dim photography and the cinematography in all, the score is pleasant and of course well-acted. my favorite is scene is the when Vito sees him dead son body and says \" Look, how they massacre my boy\" I love it, it has been featured in many, many memes and it's what got me to watch the movie in the first place.", "The greatest.": "The most perfect film ever made.  I watched it with my father when I was young (probably too young).  I have since seen it at least 50 times.  The direction, acting, costume and production is faultless.  There are so many scenes that will be remembered forever.  So many lines that people just know from memory.  The music is also sublime.  Pacino for me steals the show (and what a show).  Maybe only because he has more memorable scenes.  Duvall, Brando and Cazale run him very close.  The three scenes I love more than ever are Michael's revenge in the restaurant (greatest scene of all time!), when Michael realises from the panic in his bodyguard's face as he runs off that Apollonia is in danger and when Sonny beats up Calo and finishes him in the gutter.  Superb from start to finish.", "The epitome of cinema": "The Godfather is placed near the top of any reliable best films list. It is an American classic based on Mario Puzo's novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It recounts the ascent of Michael Corleone to the head of his crime family, originally headed by his father, \"the Godfather\" Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito is played by Marlon Brando in a key performance, which actually does not amount to all that much screen time (at least, relative to the whole film). The majority of the film focuses on Michael and his acquaintances trying to sustain an empire that satisfies their vision of an American dream.The film exhibits masterful quality in virtually every category. The acting is one of those key aspects. Although I'm not a fan of Al Pacino, his performance as Michael is unarguably a great achievement. Marlon Brando is even more iconic and unforgettable as Don Vito. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are good supporting actors. In addition, I think Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain are wrongly unappreciated as bad guys.The camera-work and direction is solid (although nothing groundbreaking). The music is fantastic. Although the main theme is most remembered, I believe the suspenseful music used to lead up to inevitable encounters is more important. It makes the tension come straight through the screen and into the audience.The movie is a little on the long side, but most of the time the scenes are completely engrossing. It would be difficult for anyone to argue that The Godfather is not a great film. While its not my favorite movie of all time, it deserves its place in critic lists. It is as near perfect a movie as you can expect a human to make.", "great great and great!!!!": "This is the best movie that i ever seen!!!\nawesome acting by Al Pacino\nand Marlon Berando\ngreat great and great!!!!!!!!!", "Atlast, i've seen The Godfather!": "I've been wanting to see this film for a while now, so i bought the new Godfather box set - The Coppola Restoration. I was worried that i wouldn't enjoy the film, because it is #1 here on IMDb and i had high expectations, i wasn't disappointed.To be honest with you, i thought it took the film about 30 minutes to get into it's stride, after that it got really good and enjoyable. It was so good after that, i had to sleep on it whether to give it a 9/10 or a 10/10, it really was a hard choice, believe me.The new Godfather Trilogy is rated for ages 15 and over, while previous trilogies have been rated for ages 18 and over. 15+ is a good rating, although there are some intense scenes (Sonny getting killed at the Tollbooth for example) it really doesn't deserve an 18 rating, i was expecting heads to have been blown apart and such but it's not that violent really.Now i can finally say i've seen The Godfather, and i loved it.

Dark and hypocritical, this is a convoluted ride to places better left on the big screen (which we now all have at home).Brando, Pacino, Duval and James Caan all deliver most convincingly, while the other actors, or soldiers (if you will) carry out their orders dedicatedly. Frances Ford Coppola struck cinema gold with the Mario Puzo best seller!", "Over-rated to high hell": "Much like The Exorcist, this is a film that is praised my amateur minds, who know little about what makes a decent film. It has a few moments that brought a smile to my face, (well, one...when if finally finished). It's far, far too long, a self-indulgence that seeps into the rest of the movie. I found Brando's performance to be hammy, unconvincing and laughable, (how did a guy resembling a giant hamster control this group of poorly-acted gangsters?) Quite literally nothing of any significance occurs in this film, it's just an endless succession of mumbling, shooting, and glaring. I suppose that masochists find it entertaining, everybody else either A; Hasn't seen it, or B; Are lying. The \"special effects\" for the shooting scenes are very 1970's, ie, poor.

An in the movie the director followed it perfectly. His work should be applauded What a movie!!! This is basically a movie on gangsters! and this has everything in the life on a don 'The Godfather'. This movie obviously deserves 10! Acotrs acted brilliantly, Story was brilliant, direction was awesome, It's just perfect!

You can use this film's message into your life and that is: 'If you have the power use it your way'", "An American Masterpiece: An Offer You Cannot Refuse": "Based on Mario Puzzo's book, The Godfather translated to the screen is an American masterpiece in the study of management and command. As a serious film it is one of the few American films which rises above syrupy American romantic comedy.Meet Vito Corleone (Marlin Brando). He's a self made American gangster who came up biting and crawling. The American mob however is different from its Sicilian progenitor racked with such vendetta driven violence that whole cities are decimated. The American offspring is a business. Wars (going to the mattresses) happen according to one character only every 10 years and then only to flush the trash out of the ranks, almost a statement one might expect to hear from a career military man.Don Vito wants to make his second son Michael (Al Pacino), a war hero into a real American of culture, rank, and distinction. Third Son Sonny (James Caan)will head the mob. Elder Son Fredo (John Cazale)is a dolt the others will have to look after. Adopted son, a non-Italian, Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) slides through a shadowy zone of near legitimacy as an attorney for the mob.War strikes. Rival gangsters want to sell drugs. The Don is firm but is almost assassinated; Sonny is killed. Only Michael is left to head the family business, defeating the Don's grand design. Will Michael survive to keep both the biological and mob family together?Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin), an official suborned by the mob, tells Michael that \"The Family\" is Michael's delusion.It was an all-star performance by the entire cast.Though I read the book many years ago. I hesitated to see the movie out of respect for the sentiments of many Italians who believe the film to be anti-Italian. After watching the film many years after its release I decided it is not anti-Italian as much as it is the finest study of leadership the American theatre has exhibited. Only Twelve O'Clock High (Gregory Peck) and Major Dundee (Charlton Heston; Richard Harris) come close in the study of the personality of command. I prefer the combined version of Godfather I & II.In the gangster film genre, the comparables ST VALENTINES DAY MASSACRE (Jason Robarts), CAPONE (Ben Gazzara), VALACHI PAPERS (Charles Bronson), and LEPKE (Tony Curtis) are all great in their own right with splendid acting but nonetheless they barely approach the eloquence of THE GODFATHER.", "But how?": "This movie was just a movie. I have a definitely sure thing as this movie just doesn't deserve this score. I'm ok with sayings like \"Omg how you say this, it's the godfather\" so what? What makes the Godfather a Godfather. Couldn't have gotten this score just for acting and editing so ? It was very very nice but it was just a New York gangs story and it was like eh. What made you feel like giving this movie a 10. What? I'm begging you to make me feel like this. I watched this movie after seeing this score and it take my 3 hours. I'm happy for satisfying my curiosity but not for movie. The Shawshank Redemption or Seven or another movies were way better. I still don't know what was the point of the movie and why it have a score like 9,2. It is clearly 7,8-8,4 and just take it away from the list top 3. I don't want to watch 2 and 3 but o have to anymore. I'm sorry.", "My second favorite movie of all time.": "I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse.", "Movies just don't get any better than this": "What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times. This is one of those movies that just holds you in thrall from beginning to end, with no let up in interest or involvement - an amazing feat under any circumstance but almost unheard of for a three-hour movie! As such, it's interesting to compare this with more recent epic-length films of today. A couple years ago, on its 25th anniversary re-release I saw this in the theater on the same day I saw \"The English Patient\". The difference in the two films was just amazing. The English Patient wasn't bad or anything, it's just that it was way too long for the story it told; a good 90 minute-to-2 hour premise was padded out with gorgeous but pointless scenery, an unnecessary subplot, and a shooting and acting style which emphasized dragging things out just for their own sake. The Godfather, by comparison, crams every single minute of its running time with richness, characterization, intrigue, etc. - so much so that, for me, the film actually seems SHORTER than its running time would lead you to believe. There's so many movies that could learn from this - movies that want to be epic length to inflate the importance of their subjects, but just arent' interesting enough to hold us for that long. Many films are guilty here, from Titanic to The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Green Mile - even such \"great\" films as Lawrence of Arabia and (yes) Shindler's List use their lengths more as endurance tests (i.e. if you can't stay interested through the whole thing than you must be somehow boorish or unfeeling) and as proofs that the directors just became so enamored of their subjects that they couldn't bear to take anything out than as necessary for the telling of their stories. Sadly, I must say that, in my opinion, even The Godfather Part II falls victim to this tendancy - definitely one of the most overrated and unnecessary sequels of all time.But if you want to see the Corleones (and Francis Ford Coppola) when they were all at the top of their game and everything was just cooking, go back and watch this movie. Even after all the imitations, the rip-offs, the parodies and the cultural appropriations of lines like \"Make him an offer he can't refuse\" and \"He sleeps with the fishes\" to the point where the movie sometimes seems as entrenched (and as tired) as cliches like \"Mom, God and apple pie\" --- once you start watching all of that stuff flies out the window and you're amazed to learn that, wonderfully, this film has lost none of its edge or entertainment value in the nearly thirty years of its existence.(BTW Don't anyone get the idea that I am against the concept of long movies - some of my all time favorites besides The Godfather are Apocalypse Now, 2001:A Space Odyssey, The Deer Hunter, and Oliver Stone's Nixon.  It's just that, I believe, a film really has to justify that running time, because it so opens the door to pretension and indulgence.)", "Best Gangster movie of all time": "The classic gangster movie that all others after it aspire to be like.

The romanticism of the Mafia is so vividly portrayed that one can't help but fall in love with the film, and the Corleone family. Well-known for its authentic visuals and the occasional sudden brutal bloody violence, The Godfather earned rave reviews worldwide upon its release, and certainly deserved its success.Solid performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, among others, earned the film an amazing four Oscar nominations for acting roles, with the former awarded an Oscar. The brilliance of The Godfather is that it's able to combine many themes and sub-plots together without confusing the viewer. Character interaction is flawless, and the captivating screenplay makes three hours well spent.Director Francis Ford Coppola lays much of the groundwork of 1970s cinema with his commanding technique. The audacious, visceral, and stately set pieces are legendary - horse's head in the bed, Sonny's horrific slaughter etc. Not to forget Nino Rota's mournful and oddly romantic famous score, which is able to conjure up different moods within the film.

I can't say that The Godfather is the best movie ever, because I haven't seen all the movies in history, although I've tried about two hundred, if I can say it's my favorite so far.For me the godfather, it is the beginning of a great tragedy for a character that we love and despise (although in my case it is more hatred). That is Miguelo / Michael, although I come to understand it, this man was forced by morals (not by his family, since he did not care about his family) to assume responsibilities that he did not want, the feeling of shame of being a Corleone and above all Being Sicilian, he only felt loyalty to his father and I repeat, for moral reasons, not for love Michael Corleone seizes the great empire that Don Vito Corleone and that good, because neither Sony nor Fredo had the capabilities.It's amazing how Coppola manages to make me feel interested in the mafia, to the point of wanting to spend a night out with the Corleone family, I would have loved to be invited to the wedding. Each sequence fascinates me, especially the christening and of course, the great scene of the gun hidden in the bathroom, I think there is no movie with so many iconic scenes.It is difficult to find errors in this film, although in my case the sequence of Sicilia loses its rhythm, at least the act in general bores me, although I do pay attention, of course it has content for the film.

This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting).

Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don't care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando. He got Brando. Brando was great.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people.

It just is the perfect synonym for cinema which can change your life.It is no secret that The Godfather has impacted so many moviegoers and made them into successful film makers or at least aspiring film makers. There are so many things which can be written about the genius of the Godfather.But the most striking thing which has to be mentioned is the perfect transition of the book onto screen.The book has been adapted so well that the movie seems better than the book in some frames.Mario Puzo and Coppola have collaborated so well that its a product of genius. Now we have heard a lot about the casting,but what can i say.I feel I am nothing to speak about the acting prowess of Marlon Brando.I have never come across a performance so spell binding with an amazing screen presence.Brando was Don Corleone will remain etched in every body's mind as the perfect man for the role. Al Pacino was simply sensational.The way he portrayed his emotions are a joy to watch on screen.His acting to me has to shown to every aspiring actor because its such a powerful act which just refuses to fade away from your memory.The supporting cast of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Cann as Sonny are exemplary. The back ground score and cinematography is of the highest class. And the dialogues are just extra ordinary.For example dialogues such as, i will make him an offer he cant refuse.I will reason with him are just so powerful but yet so subtle. Mafia was never so stylish nor powerful.It is a movie to watch for every film connoisseur because until one does not watch the God father he cannot know or cant fantasize A PERFECT MOVIE. a work of absolute Genius.I believe everybody associated with the movie is so god damn proud of himself for having his name attached to it. and I am proud of being a FANATIC of the Godfather.", "Perfect movie": "This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.", "It truly is one of the greatest films of all time": "Despite the film's now legendary status, I had only watched The Godfather for the first time yesterday. I've seen plenty of later crime films that were obviously inspired by it, so I was worried that the plot might become predictable for me due to my exposure to later inspired crime films. After my disappointment with classics like Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption (both very good films but I wouldn't consider them to be among the greatest) last month, I was also worried The Godfather might not live up to my expectations. By the time I was 45 minutes into the film, I was completely gripped by the film's unpredictable plot and the lives of the characters, and it just kept getting better as the film progressed.The plot shocked and surprised me at every twist and turn, and the film managed to keep me emotionally attached to the characters without anything ever feeling forced. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was brilliant in this regard, with dramatic events in the film simply shown as matter-of-fact, without any of the over-dramatization you often see in later crime films. The writing by Mario Puzo and Coppola was also brilliant, with plenty of foreshadowing right from the very beginning of the film.Another aspect of the film which stood out was how it wasn't simply centred around a main protagonist with the others having minor roles, but nearly the entire cast was well-developed to a high degree. Despite the powerhouse performances by Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and by Al Pacino as his son Michael, they never completely overshadowed the other cast members who were also brilliant in their own right, particularly James Caan as the elder son Santino, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Al Lettieri as 'The Turk', and Diane Keaton as Kay. Even relatively minor cast members like Talia Shire as Connie Corleone and Gianni Russo as Carlo were also very believable. It is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, with many of the actors later going on to become major stars themselves.The score by Nino Rota was also incredible. Although I was already familiar with the main theme tune, I had no idea it was from The Godfather. The tune now seemed a lot more powerful after watching the film. Nearly everything about The Godfather is spot-on, with hardly any flaws at all. The only flaw I could think of is the first half-hour being a bit slow-paced, but it really doesn't matter to me anymore seeing as how amazing the film turned out to be.In summary, The Godfather truly does live up to its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.10/10", "A Great Film Art": "A GREAT MOVIE, one of the best film art ever, the actors are great especially Al Pacino that made there(in my opinion) his best performance of his career. this movie takes you inside the Italian mafia world in the US but more important, it takes you inside the Corleone family, it shows the the relationship between the father, Don Vito and his children, especially with Michael(Al Pacino). What makes this movie so fascinating is the way that Francis Ford Coppola(the director) make you to identify with the main characters - people who murder their enemies and live like they are above the law, he make you love and admire the bad guys - The Mafia. In conclusion, the godfather is one of the best movies I have ever seen and i recommend it to all the film lovers. for anothe reviews: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur44998795/?ref_=nb_usr_prof", "Legendary": "The greatest movie of all time\neverything was perfect in this movie , the action, the story, the direction and the look of the movie\ngreat work done by all cast and crew", "i can not love this movie more": "Theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters.Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making,", "CLASSIC": "The 1972 film, The Godfather, has often been referred to as one of the greatest movies of all time. This star-studded cast showcases the start of many of these actors' careers, these actors we have come think of as legends. This film featured Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duval, and Diane Keaton. Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, the head of a crime family. From the very start of the film, Vito holds very strong ideas of respect and family. James Caan and Robert Duval are the prominent sons in Vito's underworld activities. James Caan plays Sonny Corleone, the hot-headed eldest brother, who plans to take over the family. Duval plays Tom Hagen, the right-hand man of Vito and adopted son. Al Pacino plays the youngest son of Vito, Michael. Michael is the one son who vowed to not get involved in the business of underground crime. He was a scholar and a war hero, the favorite son of Vito. However, with conflict with another crime family, there was an attempt of the life of Vito. Therefore, Michael thought of a plan to get revenge. Since Michael was the lowest threat to Sollazzo and the Police chief. So, they arranged a meeting to discuss the terms of peace. However, this moment symbolized the turn of Michael Corleone. He shot the two men in cold blood and achieving the revenge that his family so desperately wanted. We see Michael go from the war hero and scholar to the preferred next boss of the family. However, Sonny was primed to be the next boss of the family. With Sollazzo dead, his father seeked revenge on the Corleone's. Sonny was known for being erratic and having a short temper. They used the domestic abuse of his sister to draw him away from his protection and assassinated him with no witnesses. Vito, pain stricken from losing his oldest son, wanted the killing to stop. Vito would retire and Michael would become the boss of the family. Since Vito was so respected for his wisdom and silence, Michael was viewed as a threat and a joke. Soldiers that had been loyal to Vito had begun to turn on Michael. However, before the natural death of Vito, he warned Michael of the dangers to come. The other families held back on trying to kill Michael out of respect for his father. Once Vito was gone, so was Michael. However, with the intellect of Michael, he ordered the hit of every enemy that he had at the same time. This scene is done beautifully. Michael is becoming the Godfather to his sister's child. As that is happening, his soldiers are killing the people that sought to seem him dead. This extreme game of chess came to an end. Michael had now earned the respect and fear of his peers. He now began to build his reputation of being an unmerciful but calculated Don. Even though the movie is almost three hours long, I did not want it to stop.The lighting in this movie is exuberant. From when Vito is sitting behind his desk with the dimmed lights shadowing his face, or Michael riding with Sollazzo and the police chief in the car. This use of light, or lack thereof, gives the viewer a sense of the secrecy of these events. The corruption of the police department, the underground criminal enterprises of Sollazzo, the killing and deceit throughout the whole movie. Like I said above, an extreme game of chess.With the theme being about deceit and corruption. The music gives a very eerie feeling. The old Sicilian theme gives the viewer the feeling that the theme is trying to portray. The music would have such a big impact on pop-culture that when real-life mob boss, John Gotti was arrested there was a swarm of people outside protesting for his freedom with the Godfather theme song blasting from speakers. With all the death and deceit in this movie, the music even though so beautiful, has all of the feelings from the theme brought into it as well.", "The perfect movie.": "The Godfather is probably the most perfect movie ever made. A strong plot, a unique cast, direction, filming and editing are beyond words, and the music makes you blend in. There are other great movies of course, but some of them lack one or two things mentioned above. It's difficult to match this one. Francis Coppola probably did that with The Godfather Part II (1974), and he may have exceeded himself. The Godfather is such a masterpiece that you can watch it over and over again and you will never be bored but always surprised how wonderful it is. Just to see young Al Pacino change for a college boy to a ruthless mafioso is a miracle of movie-making, even more so than Marlon Brando in the title role, albeit a small one. But the most underrated role and actor in both the Godfather movies is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.", "A Timeless Snapshot of Another World": "The Godfather is rightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, and this review won't seek to be a mere repetition of its finest qualities. Technically, thematically and theatrically, the film is an undeniable masterpiece. It took what is an enjoyable, but pulpy, populist crime novel into a deft piece of art. One can only attempt to highlight some interesting observations here.Watching this again recently with friends who have never seen it before is an interesting experiment. After seeing the film numerous times one forgets that the story and the characters, while never particularly convoluted, are nevertheless numerous, steeped in a subtly defined hierarchy that for the uninitiated is overwhelming, to say the least. Especially overseas (Britain in this case), the younger generation have to fill in gaps that would have been closer to common knowledge upon release in the US. Notwithstanding its wide berth of characters and relationships, the film's central arc, that of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) descent to Don, is never clouded; Part II, while arguably as good if not better than Part I, suffers initially from juggling multiple arcs that while well-crafted and excellent, are not nearly as accessible.While all remember the set pieces, particularly the wedding and baptism that masterfully bookend the film, on multiple viewings it's the quieter, thematic scenes that really shine. A personal favourite scene is the last scene shared between Michael and Vito (Marlon Brando) discussing Vito's desires for Michael, which merges duty, family and aspiration in a truly touching scene. One can make a serious argument that The Godfather Saga is really an embodiment of the American dream (note the Statue of Liberty in the 'cannoli' scene background), and Vito's entire outlook captures this. The scene is certainly the thematic backbone of the movie.What has been occasionally discussed in detail elsewhere, but deserves a mention, is the portrayal of Kay. It's a nuanced performance by Diane Keaton, and the costume design is a fantastic touch. In her scenes where she is most distant, Kay's colours are bright reds and oranges, in sharp contrast to the surrounding characters (the wedding; when she looks for Michael at the compound). As she falls in with the family, her colours become muted. In terms of gender portrayal (something the film almost-understandably struggles with; it never comes close to passing the Bechdel test), Kay certainly fares better as a character than Apollonia, who is little more than an object of desire. Her willingness to be there for Michael is almost questionable however. Yet, ultimately this is a quintessential story about men, in a world where women had not yet encroached as individuals separate from men (it's no accident that the women get a greater role in Part III). One can suggest that the fact that all the women are defined by their male connections is less the fault of the material than it is the reality of the profession and period.The Godfather, possibly by virtue of being a period piece, has barely aged in 40 years. Sure, the issues it discusses and the world it portrays are transformed, but like a painting it captures beautifully a freeze frame, a snapshot period of aspiration and ambition. It will continue to be adored for years to come.", "Seeing this movie is an offer you can't refuse!": "I saw this movie for the first time when I was 17.  The best part was the wedding!  The Godfather is one of my favorite movies, part 2 was cool, too! This movie isn't only about a Mafia power struggle, it also focuses on honoring and looking out for the family, and not to mention the Italian culture!  I've spent a lot of my summers during my childhood in Italy.  So, I understood what was happening when Sonny was beating up on Connie's abusive husband and when Michael warned Fredo in Vegas never to go against his family.  The Corleones were a very close, tight family who looked out for each other and stood up for one another during Mafia battles and other conflicts as well.  And it all boiled down to honoring the family! \n I was also rooting for Michael when he took down Sollozo and the Police Chief!  Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors, and was excellent in this, and in a lot of his other movies, too.  So, if you haven't seen this movie, please go and rent it!  You might like it, or maybe you won't.  But it's still worth seeing.", "I'm Sorry, Not Worth the Hype": "I don't know why everybody who loves this film loves it so much. Maybe the fact everybody hyped it up meant i was never going to fully enjoy this but to be honest, it seemed slow and confusing and i struggled to keep my concentration. Constantly, i found myself drifting off and daydreaming. I would have stopped watching but i had a Uni assignment on it.It has some great scenes but everybody has seen them before anyway. The acting is good but I thought Al Pacino has been better in other things.Also, it was hard to make out, the characters speak so quietly it just turns into background noise.It's not the worst film I've ever seen, no way. but it certainly isn't in the top 10, not even close.The game is better, you get all the good scenes without the fairly dull bits in between.", "Marlon Brando totally believable": "Excellent adult move. Love the music. I could have watched this all day long. Perfect length, if anything too short. Marlon Brando really defines the role of an Italian mafioso patriarch. I permanently learned the phrase, \"make them an offer they can't refuse.\" Al Pacino gives another brilliant performance as the son who get drawn into his father's business, bit by bit. Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino's character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable. Just thinking about the movie brings to mind the musical score second to the character, the Godfather played by Marlon Brando. So powerful!", "Ok movie": "I find this movie a little bit boring at some part but u will enjoy it if u like gangster thriller type movie.\nA classic movie\nThe acting in this movie is top class\nI enjoyed this movie basically due to those top class acting", "Classic film": "This film, without a doubt, is one of the most popular films in history.\"The Godfather,\" as we all know, is based on an early 70's novel by Italian author Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of one family and it's destiny...the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (the Godfather) is the head of the Corleone family and runs his 1940's New York empire with Mafia justice. The story begins with the wedding of Vito's daughter, Connie, to Carlo Rizzi. Present in the wedding include Vito's sons and heirs, Sanito (\"Sonny\"), Fredo, and, most famous of all, Michael, the reluctant heir to his father's business.While the Corleone family is wealthy and fortunate, they also have some rival Mafia families, such as the Tattaglia, Sollozzo, Brasi, and son on and so forth. Tragedy occurs when Vito is injured by the gun of one of the rivals, and thus, a tale of the mafia, bloodshed, and family takes place. \"The Godfather\" chronicles the story of a family trying to stay on top during a dog-eat-dog era, revenge and murder, family and trust, as well as the rise of Michael Corleone as the don (head) of his family and how he avenged his entire family from all rivals.Puzo's novel was brought to the screen by legendary director Francis Ford Coppolla, whose daughter, Sophia, is now following his footsteps and unleashing her directional legacy with films like \"Virgin Suicides\" and \"Lost in Translation.\" F.F. Coppolla uses his talents to tell Puzo's story through actors and actresses.Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone and brings a fine Michael Corleone, portraying the his character well. Pacino shows the evolution of Michael from the reluctant young man to this ruthless don and willing godfather like his dad. Diane Keaton also stars in this movie, playing Michael's non-Italian wife, Kay Adams. But, of course, the title role (the Godfather) is given to the recently-deceased legend Marlon Brando. Brando is truly Vito Corleone, bar none, and you better respect him or else.Other than the actors and actresses, the sets are good, too. This is not a cheery and bright film but a dark and gloomy epic. The grim and gritty 40's-50's NYC sets reflect the brutality of that time, when gangs were the rulers of New York's streets. However, the Corleone family's Italian heritage is also reflected, and who's better in making Italian music than Italian composer, Nino Rota? The Godfather theme song (\"Speak Softly, Love\") is just as classic as the film.\"The Godfather\" was released in 1972. It was a critical and commercial success, winning several Oscars, even, best of all, Best Picture. It was followed by 1974's \"Godfather, Part II,\" and 1990's \"Part III.\" The first sequel was just as acclaimed as the first while the latter had mixed reviews. But still, all of these films are regardless as classics by critics and the movie-going public. Many consider this film to be the greatest film of all time.Runningtime 175 mins. (2 hrs. 57 mins.) Rated R for graphic violence", "Best of All": "This movie is the best movie i have watched so far. I would recommend this movie to all of you people must have a look on it once this is insane.In an interview with the Dailytimes, Sheth Jeebun talked about the importance of sustainability and the impacts of overconsumption of carbohydrates on the human body. He said that he makes all the Aster Health Care homes completely paper-free with technology to reduce the carbon footprints.", "World's Greatest Film that's always The Godfather": "The Godfather (1972) was voted number 1 by Entertainment Weekly's readers in 1999 and voted as number 1 in a Time Out readers' poll in 1998. The film was voted the \"Greatest Movie of All Time\" in September 2008 by 10,000 readers of Empire magazine, 150 people from the movie business, and 50 film critics.", "Simply the best. Against which all other films should be measured": "I must have seen this film 20 times and I will probably see it 20 times more, it is that good.Why is this? First of all the story is exceptional, almost Shakespeareian and Machiavellian in it's scope and subject. Although the film is about the succession struggle and rise of an American-Italian Mafia Don against the background of gang warfare it is very reminiscent of the stories of European Renaissance Princes. Complete with assassinations, political intrigue, war and cold hearted iron will. Also compared to other films there happens an awful lot in this movie, so much so in fact that I tend to forget half of it which enhanced the 'see it again' factor, because I can't quite remember exactly what happened next.The second reason why this movie is exceptional are the acting performances which are truly amazingly good across the board. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are all great, but so are the all the lesser supporting actors. This is all further helped by the very believable dialog between the characters, the pace and direction of the movie which keeps the suspense up and things going along nicely. Also the social drama with the sister, wife and brothers is really engaging. The balance is also good between moments of relative quiet leading up to moments of action and terror. Great cinematography and production values to boot . Highly entertaining viewing all round. You can't ask for more.Highly Recommend.", "World's Greatest Movie That's Always The Godfather": "Spectacular Movie and The Godfather is my Favourite Film and Al Pacino is a great actor and I like Marlon Brando Acting in the Godfather film. The world's greatest movie is Godfather and World's Greatest Actor is Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.", "primkaisen": "This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.", "James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent": "James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" - in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while \"The Godfather Part II\" was the second - in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her.", "The film that every crime drama after and to this day is inspired by.": "This film is pretty much one of those perfect movies. I see nothing wrong with this amazing film. The acting is fantastic, the score is excellent, the writing is great, and the cinematography is beautiful. When people think perfection in film making they usually either think \"Citizen Kane\" or this. It is expertly told story that spans through many years. The characters are great, and the relationships they have feel real. The story unfolds excellently, and by the time it is over you felt like you were part of the film. It is without a doubt the most influential crime drama ever made. This film is pure artistry at its finest.4 stars out of 4", "Too overated.": "Its a good movie but it doesnt deserve the place for second best rated movie. I have seen much much better movies with 7 rate or 8.", "Godfather is still on the top; boring....": "Yes yes, this movie is a fundamental classic, an epic piece, a masterstroke from Coppolla, Brando, Pacino, etc. But is it really the best movie ever? Well, that's how I interpret the fact it has been on the top of IMDb since I've looked in here for the first time. What makes it so flawless, what contributes to its eternal shining, blah blah. Maybe it's high time for a change, I'm sure a lot of cult classics have been released since The Godfather has been released. Oh well...I don't like The Godfather. I simply don't feel this movie. Yes it's gloomy, yes it's about mafia's dirty deeds, and oh yes it's about being a part of a family. And of course it's about Kleenex in Marlon's mouth, and Pacino's hands kissed by sad Italians. However I have a feeling that this movie has spawned a countless number of mafia movies, recycling the same themes and Robert De Niro, and furthermore movies like 60 Seconds or Ronin or The Italian Job, which are merely about how cool is it to be a gangster. Which I hate, obviously.", "One of the top 5 Best movies of all time.": "Another one paragraph review. Anyways, what a masterpiece. The story is one of a fall and rise of a family. The Corleone family saga is one of, if not the best family in fiction. The characters in this film are the best in all of cinema and some of the best, ever. Vito is an incredibly complex and well written character, also Marlon Brando, who obviously plays Vito, gives off his best performance and arguably the greatest performance ever. His incredible facial expressions and emotional and superb line delivery really make this film amazing. Of course we cannot forget about Michael, who is also an incredibly complex and well written character. Al Pacino gives off an incredible performance, with his cold, deep looks in various scenes (such as the Baptism, which is the best scene in this film), and his line deliverance. Everybody else also gives a phenomenal performance like Robert Duvall. Then, the screenplay. The screenplay is extremely complex and well written, with great dialogue, written by Mario Puzo and FFC. Almost every scene is perfectly and beautifully written, the best written scene in this film being by far the restaurant scene. The script in this film is incredibly layered and complex and is greatly written overall, having one of the greatest scripts in cinema. Also, this is an incredibly well directed and beautiful film with some of the best shots in cinema. My favorite shots are that of the shots in the darkness, symbolizing the doom that is coming for the Corleone family, and the shadiness of the family and its mob. And, the story is an emotional, tragic fall and rise of a family, and every scene is absolutely superb in this amazing family saga, like the haunting baptism scene. There is also incredibly compelling subplots as well interwoven through the film, and in the end it all comes together for one of the greatest conclusions in all of cinema. Also, the score by Nino Rota is superb and really sets the mood and tone. Overall, this film is basically flawless with an emotional and tragic story, perfect acting, a phenomenal script, beautiful cinematography, and an amazing score.10/10.", "Why don't they make films like this anymore?": "Why don't they make films like this anymore? This is what movies should be. Sure, they don't have to be this long, but 99% of todays movies are pretty weak compared to this. It's funny actually, I knew this was one of the most famous classics before I saw it. I knew it is considered among the top 10 films almost everywhere. Yet everyone I know has either referred to it as the most boring film in history or never even bothered to finish it. Now that I've seen it I can't help but think, what a pity. Today we are given so much garbage, that when a real film comes along, we are suddenly confused. We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along. Francis Ford Coppola made a timeless film with the godfather, and he should rank among the top ten, no the top five directors of all time. Stanley Kubrick once said: \"Coppola sure got it right with The Godfather\". And I dare todays director to \"get it right\" in the future.I give this film a 10/10.", "Best mob film ever made": "I don't know how many times I've seen this film, but it's one of those movies I can just sit down and watch again & again.

The acting is outstanding, the story line is very well written, and it just has all those moments that, even though you've seen the movie before, you want to see them again. Like, for instance, when the movie mogul wakes up to find his prized horse's head in his bed. Just thinking of the horror of that actually happening to someone, you know he's not going to go against the Godfather's wishes. And the moment Michael pulls the trigger to kill the drug kingpin and the police captain which means he is no longer an innocent bystander and is fully \"in.\" This movie has so many mini-climaxes like this which eventually lead to the finale in which Michael rises to the top.The best thing about this movie is that it never gets old. It will never be outdated, since it's set in the 40's, so it's a timeless classic.This is without a doubt the best mob film ever.", "Excellent Movie": "Excellent, outstanding for ever...

The film is built upon a significant historical period, shows not only the role of foreign immigrants and their difficulties in building an identity in America as it is also very thorough in addressing how the Italian mafia was organised for several decades in USA. For this and more, \" The Godfather \" is a film which must be seen, a reference that needs to be seen by all those who love movies and want to understand the social development of the United States at the beginning of the last century.", "The Godfather Savage Film": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing.

The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.", "Superb": "It's the best trilogy ever made, considering the time.

His astonishing portrayal of Vito makes me sad that he's not going to appear in the sequels.Al Pacino also plays a beautiful role, one of Vito's sons who later takes on the family business. Notice how he transforms himself from this calm war-hero to a hard-ass Don. Not a lot of people can do that.I love how the movie - most of it at least - takes place in New York while most of the characters are Italian. But that only spices the movie up. The story is unique and smartly written, and it suits me since I like the time that it took place in.So if you're a fan of the post-WWII age, then I strongly urge you to get this movie. Hell, even if you're not, it would be a shame if you don't watch it.", "Simply a masterpiece": "I guess we have all seen the movie, but at the moment I am writing an essay about it, and therefore seeing it over and over, and I must say, it is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.... However, Godfather part II is close.... See it, and you want to be a gangster", "An example of how films should be made. Perfect.": "There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said already but that's not going to stop me praising this film. Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films ever made and is often considered to be the best by many. For an explanation, it's impossible to pick any one reason as this is a near perfect film with all elements set perfectly in place.A very important part of The Godfather's iconic status is Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. His profile from the first film has provided a symbol which represents all three films, despite Brando only being in the first instalment, and an icon that commands respect. Brando appeared long finished as an actor, his looks diminishing and his status being lost but his classic performance in The Godfather put him firmly back on the acting map, where he now has a permanent place. His performance is excellent in this film, despite his mouth being crowded by moth balls! OK, so you can't hear every word he says, but you don't need to when his body language and non-verbal cues say so much for themselves. The character of Vito is very powerful, yet very frail and Brando puts these two qualities in perfect juxtaposition. A classic display, which still gets talked about 30 years on. Al Pacino whose film career was just beginning with this film, is also fantastic and ensured that wherever the film was plot wise, that powerful displays were on show at all times. His character transformation is compelling and his storyline with Diane Keaton is intriguing to give Godfather a more personal atmosphere and also to provide a much deeper plot. This film is seen as a landmark for acting, with Brando winning an Academy Award and with Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duval all receiving nominations.Central to the films core is the plot which is so intensely dramatic, that two hours does not seem enough to justify such a story. There are dozens of relationships involved in this story and there is an assassination plot and both Michael and Vito Corleone have their own separate storyline. All of these are done fantastically, ensuring the audience can have full empathy for all the characters and also be thoroughly entertained. Mario Puzo is clearly a gifted writer and does a fantastic job of portraying criminal organisations and what goes on in these families, a true representation or not, it makes for a fantastic film. Whilst his success in film was mainly limited to The Godfather series and Superman, Puzo must be gifted to write such material and was definitely worthy of the awards he won. The Godfather is a prime example of what is missing in most of today's films; a character driven plot. This film shows that you do not need explosions and high octane chases to keep an audience gripped and that a quality script and fascinating characters are enough to amass an audience.This is all wonderfully brought together by Francis Ford Coppola who, because of this film, has left his mark on the film world for eternity. It is the atmosphere he builds in this film that makes it so effective. Everything is dark and bleak except for when Pacino is exiled but that ends in tragedy. Coppola does brilliantly to emphasise the point that the world of criminal organisations is not a nice place and that no matter how safe you feel, your fate is waiting for you just around the corner. The film contains very little in the way of set pieces, instead everything appears very intimate, highlighting how personal the Mafia can be. The uncompromising nature of the film must have been very shocking at the time as there is a lot of violence that would have been skirted around at the time.The classic score to The Godfather is also integral to the film as it compliments all the visual elements on the screen. The sophisticated appearance of the Mafioso for instance and the general demeanour of the higher ranked gangsters are emphasised by the slow classical music.This film is responsible for most of the post modern approach to film making and acting and his also the landmark to which other crime movies compare themselves. The Godfather's image and style live to this day and will for generations to come. The first of a fantastic series, Godfather is an example of how films should be.", "Highly overrated Movie...": "IMDb Rating: 9.2 Major awards : Won 3 Oscars Best actor award :Marlon BrandoOne question : Did it deserved? Answer: Absolutely NotI didn't grow up in the 70s, and I understand that every movie belongs to its generation. After watching this movie, although I cant say I didn't enjoy it, I am far from considering it best movie ever; and certainly it is absolutely preposterous to make it #1 here.I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3 hours.I had a very high expectations from this movie after reading lots of user reviews that this movie is a classic cult and base for all the upcoming mafia stories.My problems with this movie:1- Pace : the movie was 3 hours long. I couldn't watch it at one go as it became too boring in the middle 2- Character development : There was no character development. I couldn't understand why Al pacino fell in love with the gal in Sicily spite of having a girlfriend and how shamelessly he came back to his x girlfriend after loosing his wife without giving any concrete explanation3- Editing: The entire trip to Sicily was unwanted and could be avoided to shorten the movie. There were many unnecesarly scenes in the movie4- Acting : Personally I don't think Marlon Brando was suitable for this movie. As for a gangster I would consider someone with a very high vocal. I don't feel he deserved the Oscar as he did nothing extra ordinaryThe Good:1- James Caan acting 2- Good start to the movie 3- Few good scenes here and there 4- Good acting by Al Pacino in the climaxFinal Verdict: Highly Overrated. Definitely not the \"best movie ever material\"", "Boring drivel": "Simply put, this is a very poor movie.  The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time).  Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds.  The closest explanation I've gotten from anyone I've talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because \"it's the Godfather.\"A movie that puts you to sleep and is not exciting or interesting does not belong as the greatest movie of all time to me.", "Under a mask of corruption lies the face unity": "The Godfather, as so many before me, and so many after me will stipulate and emphasize is more than a family's way of life through crime. It not only projects the ironies, debacles, rises, falls and basic aspects of corruption but reveals the true meaning of family. Yes, it might seem odd and disturbing to allude to a people of invidious and ulterior principles to 'family', but when we characterize the word as an interface of love, commitment and connections through blood, no other type of portrayal is more symbolic than the Godfather. I will not bore and weigh my comment down through superfluous lines of the general story of the Godfather as so many others have done (and in better terms than I could possibly ever write). Rather, I will address a controversy which has spread amongst all fans of this enduring classic around the globe. In what way is the Godfather a reflection of family? Well.. to begin with the Corleones are family through blood. On a less literal level how does the Godfather epitomize the moral ethics of 'family'? The main component of a strong and progressive family is commitment. People may generally say 'Everyone knows that the most important part of a family is commitment', but this is where they are wrong. Most relationships in America are based on love or in a more ephemeral sense, infatuation. Commitment seems to be the more onerous and tedious part of love, simply because it is harder to sustain. In order to sustain a commitment one must be accustomed to routine. In order to get accustomed to routine it is imperative to have and hold an interest. Interest is where most love relationships break down because it simply cannot last. Most people are far too capricious to maintain an interest in anything (even as important as keeping a commitment in order to raise a family) for too long. This is where the forbearance of the Corleone family is outstanding. Through profitable business exploitation and singularly successful organized crime the Corleone's omnipotent infiltration of businesses often invoked anger in affiliate mafia groups seeking status elevation which ultimately resulted in the assassinations of Don Vito and Santino Corleon. Even at the breach of these two losses Michael Corleone readily steps up to the plate as the new Patriarch with rigor to supplant his former indifference. In just bloated proportions to 'ordinary' families in which commitment sacrifices time and money, commitment for the Corleones demands a greater sacrifice which is never too great for them to give. This is a sacrifice of life and security. Where the normal American family finds a sanction away from crime, the geography of their bounds is dwelled on by Corleones", "Great movie but better the second time around.": "I had heard so much hype surrounding the Godfather movies but I had never seen them. I finally decided to sit down and watch the Godfather. Maybe my expectations were way too high before I watched it because everyone was regarding this as the greatest movie ever made. When I sat down to watch it, during the first hour I was bored out of my mind. It put me to sleep and I cut it off and decided to watch it later. A few days later I decided to watch the rest of the movie and started to realize the movie's greatness.If you get past the first hour the movie is highly entertaining with great dialog and great acting. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in American History in my opinion.Watching the movie the second time made me realize that this is probably one of he greatest movies ever. The character development is excellent and you understand that more upon the second viewing.In summary, if you haven't seen this movie don't expect to be blown away the first time watching. Let the movie develop and when the movie ends you will want to watch it again from the beginning to understand everything that happened. After that you would be hard pressed to deny this movie as one of the greatest.", "Powerful heart movie": "A young director (Coppola) took by paramount with no big experience and a young protagonist (Al Pacino) with no big experience too, together they realized the greatest movie never made! Taken by the Mario Puzo's book, the Godfather isn't a really mafia story but, overall, is a story of a family, of a man who live for make it stronger and more powerful who finished to ruin it with his same hands... A story of cruel moments and a story of heart's tears too... Now, thirty years later it still be the greatest motion picture never done, with a screenplay with no equals, a cast strong, powerful and good-acting and with a love inside that isn't scary of the present and the future of the cinema....

I couldn't see anything particularly good about it to be honest and I'm not one for finding fault normally but I would have to say that this is a badly directed, dragging film with unconvincing story and acting. Honestly, you'd think someone else would have noticed before it got to the movie house, wouldn't you? If I could only use 10 words to describe this film they would be: Lame, Pedestrian, and Not as good as you think it is. So come on film buffs, let's admit the game is up, you've been found out.", "An absolute classic": "Wow, Absolutely amazing film. A wonderful cast of actors.", "Could have been a lot better.": "Because of all the hype surrounding Godfather, I decided to take the plunge. I started out reading the book. I read the first 40 pages on a long flight. Not wanting to spend endless hours reading nearly 500 pages, I decided to watch the movie instead. I have to say I was disappointed. Godfather is basically a soap opera shortened to 3 hours.First, there's too much dialogue. Godfather's probably 10% action and 90% talk. It wouldn't been so bad if you could understand the conversations, but I found myself constantly missing out on something and having to rewind. I particularly got lost when the Don meets the Sollozzos for the first time. This conversation was one of the most important parts of the film, yet I heard nothing but mumblings.The jumbled storyline doesn't help either and not much makes sense. Michael's activities in Italy, his business dealing in Vegas, and him beating up a guy in the street had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Why the hell those scenes even added? I have never seen a movie that conveyed so much confusion to their audience.The acting was excellent though, but as one has already mentioned - lacked depth. Godfather had little character development and the characters do not have distinct personalities. I swear you couldn't tell Michael or Sonny apart. I think this was more the fault of the scriptwriters or director. Also the chemistry between Kay and Michael just wasn't there. Their marriage at the end seemed odd because of the poorly scripted relationship between them throughout the film.A good movie in my definition should be one that can be interpreted by even a ten year old. Too often, the movie conveys too little information and expects you know everything that's going on.I do have to say the movie has an artistic quality to it. The setting and camera-work beautifully done. And as I have said before, the acting was top-notch. Unfortunately the negative aspects doesn't make up for it. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe it was over. I was like, that's it? I was expecting so much more, especially for being a top ranked movie on IMDb.If you want to see a real movie/show, watch Prison Break.", "The re-release of the masterpiece": "I consider this movie as one of the best movies of all time and used to watch it on tv and I was really excited to re-watch the 50 years old movie in cinema !

Let me know! :)", "The Yawn Father...": "If there was a zero out of 10, that's what I'd give it.I know so many people hear the movie title, \"The Godfather\" and automatically feel like praising that movie, that whole trilogy, to the high heavens.

One of the great aspects of this film is the fact that it is watchable over and over again. The story line is good, no excuse me great, all of the actors from the awesome Marlon Brando, to the underrated Talia Shire turn in superb performances.    The story centers on Don Vito Carleone (Brando) and his family. James cann turns in a standout performance as Sonny. Diane Keaton's role is small but she plays the character of Kay perfect. The Godfather has one of the most gripping storylines that has come across in any film. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking. While there is no such thing as a perfect film, because someone will always find something they don't like in a movie, The Godfather is a film with few flaws. There is action, some comedy, a little romance, and tons of drama. The Godfather is about one family and how they will and do kill for each other. It's a movie that at the center is about what we all do to survive in this world. At most it's a film that will make its viewer escape their everyday reality and step into a wild that hopefully most of us haven't become accustomed to. 3.9 out of 4 stars.

It should be classified as an old-time movie before the watershed of a certain era.\nThe plot, setting, performance, rhythm... Basically all aspects have reached a very high standard with the standard evaluation at the time. But at the same time, it is also greatly limited to the framework of old-time movies.\nIf measured by modern life rhythms and aesthetic habits, the film's plot and rhythm are long and tedious, the performance is deliberate and formal, and the amount of information is not large...

This is a standard \"cause and effect\" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals.

This means you can't argue with taste.My opinion is that the godfather is a movie of great quality, however, there are other movies, TDK, for instance which are more entertaining. Its similar to how in high school, they make you read all those dreadful \"classics\" To Kill a Mockinbird, Fahrenheit 451, The Great Gatsby, Macbeth, Hamlet... etc. Even though Harry Potter might be exponentially more exciting than this list of classics, it doesn't have that much literary value.

It's been aired on television numerous times, but I really didn't feel like sitting through a 5 hour run time (with added commercials). So I finally decided I should watch this film and get it over with, so through my local library I checked out The Godfather.The film was very disappointing through the first watch, though the length of the film didn't bother me, I couldn't understand half of what Marlon Brando was saying. I was ready to rate The Godfather 5 stars when I came across a review from someone with similar feelings that said they watched the film again with subtitles. So I thought why not try to watch this disappointing film again with subtitles. What a difference!The second watching with subtitles completely change my experience of The Godfather. I was able to understand the story a lot better and I'm glad I gave the film a second chance. It's 9 stars for me!", "Awful, Awful, Awful": "The Godfather is a pointless, noisy, mindless, violent excuse for a film. It just seems to be an excuse to use the 'f' word for three hours.

Read it if you're unsure in any aspect about the movie": "Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars.The movie is an undoubtable classic. I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie \"Avatar\" (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now. Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: \"Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.\" They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other. I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a \"mere\" 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a \"perfect\" movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat \"harsh marker,\" and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it. On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don't like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life.", "The most complete film of all time.

Very few are those who haven't seen it or those who don't value it. The Godfather came to life in 1972 by the hands of Francis Ford Coppola transferring Mario Puzo's novel into the screen. It stars Marlon Brando (Don Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), Diane Keaton (Kay), between others. The plot describes one of the five families of organised crime in New York around the late 40s and the first half of the 50s, the Corleones, more specifically the transition of power from Don Corleone to his son, Michael. Marlon Brando has one of the best performances I've seen, if not the best. It's amazing how he managed to incorporate the old gangster. Many people appreciate more his way of talking, this is not what makes it unique though, try to notice his facial expressions and you'll see it. Al Pacino also comes in great form but falls to second layout because of Brando's marvel. Coppola confines himself to the family and mixes it with the sheer and simple life that gangsters try to attach to their family, but many times fail to.

I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films.And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It's atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola's style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it's very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one's realization, he or she will realize it is not those things.I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren't obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we're watching it from a completely different angle. And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else's certainty that is the best movie ever. It's okay if you still don't like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don't see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it.", "Completely overrated": "Fine if no one is saying anything I will this movie is overrated I understand why people THAT time (1970s) liked it back then it was something new and probably the most realistic movie they got back THEN but honestly there is SO MANY movies that are WAY better though I do understand why MEN liked it but honestly I've been watching movies from a very young age and this movie wasn't even mid it was low the idea is SO basic and old and yeah you will say it's an old movie in the 70s and that's why you need to let it go you just like it because it old and old fashioned how about you move on from OH THOESE WERE THE GREATER DAYS and start get nostalgic people who are like this need to move to actually better movies with better plot and actually more realistic in OUR time and honestly it was SO misogynistic and I just lost 3 hours of my life in trash.", "best movie ever": "Must see movie of all times love this movie all of the godfathers movies", "My Favourite Film Of All Time 10/10": "Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told.", "A great piece of entertainment": "The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): \"Don't ever take sides against the family.\" Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece.", "good": "I like this movie for me is a Good film, all look prety fine", "Outstanding first part of the gangster epic that focuses on the life of the mafia from the perspective of the family.": "This movie is outstanding for a great number of reasons. Not only is the film aesthetically pleasing but the grandiose storytelling at work is a must see for any film enthusiast.The real success of this film is the much discussed, understated performance from Al Pacino. It is ironic that an actor who is famous in contemporary cinema for his over the top performances in 'Heat'(When I think of a woman's ass..) and 'Devil's Advocate (insert any line here) delivered one of the finest understated performances in cinema history. Another actor could have over played the part and rotted what has to be seen as the films core. Where Pacino is the core, admirable support surrounds him, with brother Sonny (James Caan was never better) and father Don Vito (Marlon Brando) played lovingly and sympathetically. Brando excels in his death sequence playing it with real heart and also displaying the frailty of a former 'tough guy'.Although labelled as a masculine film, the film heralds to great supporting performances from Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. The chemistry between Diane Keaton and Al Pacino in the opening wedding scene is a rare thing and the Documentary featured on the DVD allows us to see more of this. Any couple not gripped by the inner turmoil of the male/female relationships in this film must have hearts made of stone.Finally, my favourite aspect of the film is the work of Walter Murch. This is evident in the caf\u00e9 sequence where Murch added the sound of the train to the soundtrack. Cinema has never been so tense.The only way that anyone can realise the true power of what is the finest single achievement in cinema is by watching it themselves. And remember without the first film, the second would never have existed.", "Truly one of the greatest films of all time!": "Most film critics say that 'The Godfather' is one of the greatest films of all time, and I agree with them.First of all, i'd like to say this is Marlon Brando's best performance yet! Al Pacino had a stupendous performance too, alongside legends like Robert Duvall and James Caan.The writing was good all-in-all which made it an Oscar, the violent scenes were action packed but blood baths (so don't watch it with children). Francis Ford Coppola did everything to make this a great movie so kudos to him.All-in-all this is a must see movie before you die, I hope there will be more movies as good as this.", "Bad, really really bad!": "Okay, so I've seen this now and I began asking myself, how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at IMDb and how come everyone loves this movie? I've seen this and, it's horrible. I fell asleep after watching two hours of this. This and Pirates of the Caribbean is the only movies I've fallen asleep to, seriously, and yet it's so unrealistic, like when Don Corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives. You would die after two shots from those types of guns also.Go see Donnie Brasco if you like gangster movies. This is bad, really BAD!", "A Multi-generational crime saga film": "The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.One of the original \"Movie Brats\" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial super stardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" The almost three hours, R-rated saga film (for violence and graphic language) won three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando refused to accept the award) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola). The other seven nominations included three for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino), Best Director, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, and Best Costume Design. One of The Godfather's original eleven nominations was removed, Best Music (Original Dramatic Score), when it was determined that Nino Rota's score had been used for a previous film.Gangster films are one of the oldest of film genres (starring Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart), emerging as an influential force in the early 1930s (e.g., Little Caesar (1930), Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932)). This gangster film re-invented the gangster genre, elevating the classic Hollywood gangster film to a higher level by portraying the gangster figure as a tragic hero. The rich and enthralling film is characterized by superb acting and deep character studies, beautiful photography and choreography, authentic recreation of the period, a bittersweet romantic sub-plot, a rich score by Nino Rota, and superbly-staged portrayals of gangster violence. Its grim, dark passages and bright exterior scenes are all part of the beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis.The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime \"family\" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid-1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch \"Don\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Sicilian immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American \"families\" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime \"family,\" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words \"Mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with \"the family\"). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink.", "Slow, boring, overrated and almost put me to sleep.": "I honestly don't get how this movie is so highly rated... it is extremely slow and boring. The only saving grace was Marlon Brando's performance in the film, apart from that, this film literally did nothing. From someone who loves a good gangster movie, this movie was absolute garbage. Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos way and Scarface are all amazing films and make this movie seem like a lullaby because it's enough to put you to sleep with its extremely slow and gentle pace. The movie runs for appeox 3 hours and going outside and watching the grass grow would be a more exciting thrill that sitting through this absolutely overrated disaster.", "as they said... this movie not happening everyday": "I don't want to talk too much, but the spontaneity of the performance, made me witness to what happened.I consider myself lucky to stay a life.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\") have become legendary.", "Simple and Incredible.": "I am 19 years old, but I've been seeing and listening about this movie my whole life, so I finally sat and watched it.\nAnd it is astonishing by the fact, that what turns the movie to be so good is, the most common, usual, old conversations (knowing what that conversation will lead to). I enjoy Mafia movies since day one, so watching this masterpiece was like playing Mafia games. The Godfather has on hands an incredible cast.\nI do believe Al Pacino was born to portray mobsters in Mafia movies, and you clearly see how good he is, since the Dinosaurs age. (old times if you didn't understand what supposed to be a \"joke\").", "dull, uninspiring...": "Sorry, but after all the hype between LOTR_vs_Godfather debate, I decided to check this film out. Being a huge fan of LOTR for many years, I wanted to see it from THEIR perspective. But I was expecting SO much more - what did I get? An uninspiring 'epic'. Where was the storytelling? Where was the superb direction. And I know what i'm talking about when it comes to GOOD films (A Clockwork Orange, The Pianist, The Great Escape, The Elephant Man, The Evil Dead and any Ray Harryhausen masterpiece...) and this doesn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, I love gangstar films - but not this one. Sorry, this isn't the 'greatest' movie of all time. Go rent SPY KIDZ II or something... I can't understand how this compares and tops the movie list...everyone i've spoken too (apart from my mate Justin) hates this film. If it was THAT good, everyone would own it on DVD which they don't ... go figure...", "Never did like it": "I recently saw the godfather again, 34 times I think. Now, never was a Brando fan, can't stand mob movies, so why should I like this one? Simply, because everyone else does. Its not that the acting's bad (except for brando) its not that its a mob movie, OK, it is that it is a mob movie. I mean seriously, pick a better topic! Not a realistic view of the mob. The mob did things quietly never have I heard in history of a mobsters getting gunned down in his car by many bullets. Oh, and another thing, if this movie is supposed to be realistic, why did the gas can blow up when the shot the car?Only see this movie if you love mob movies and love brando", "THE Gangster Film!": "As just a drama film, the Godfather is excellent, with it's engaging storyline, well drawn characters, tight script, and all the rest of the clich\u00e9s. In the genre of the Gangster film it has no peer.Where so many gangster pictures seem to just be commentaries on how quirky they are and how explosively violent, this film has so much more to say and explores the lives of it's characters from every perspective.We see the aging Don playing with a grandchild. We have the family member who wants nothing to do with the life of a wise-guy but whose love for his father and murder of his wife by rivals draws him in. We also see a gangster using violence not to solidify his position or intimidate, but simply acting violently to mistreatment of his sister.The film has such depth of realism and is so far above and beyond the scope of most gangster fare.", "A Thrilling and Suspenseful Crime Drama": "The Godfather is a 1972 crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola that tells the story of the Corleone crime family, a powerful and influential mafia clan in New York City. The film follows the patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando), as he navigates the complex and dangerous world of organized crime, and it explores themes of family, loyalty, and the human condition.One of the standout features of The Godfather is its portrayal of the complex and multi-layered relationships within the Corleone family. The film is a nuanced exploration of the dynamics of family and the ways in which people connect and disconnect with one another, and it is a thought-provoking and emotional portrayal of the human experience.The acting in The Godfather is superb, with standout performances from Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Robert De Niro as his son, Michael. Brando's portrayal of Vito is iconic and unforgettable, and De Niro's performance is both powerful and nuanced. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film. The Godfather is a classic and iconic film that is not to be missed. It is a powerful exploration of family and the human condition, and it is also a thrilling and suspenseful crime drama.", "Probably the best I've ever seen": "This movie is excellent! Probably the best I've ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I've read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I've seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!", "An offer you can conceivably refuse...": "WARNING! SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!The beginning of The Godfather is both horrifying and engrossing. The first shot is in a dark room, as a man speaks to Vito Corleone (Brando) of an appalling attempted rape on his daughter. The criminals have escaped American justice, but he wants (what he considers) real justice to be done. As it is his daughter's wedding day, Corleone (as a Sicilian) mustn't refuse a reasonable request. And thus, the opening scene of the film plunges the viewer directly into what is one of the most respected movies of all time.And yet, as effective as this move is, it can also be extremely confusing. As a non-Italian viewer, the sudden immersion into Italian culture created a disconcerting effect.Thankfully, for a film that is nearly three hours long, The Godfather has plenty of action going on, spanning 10 years, yet rarely becoming boring. Unfortunately, when it does become boring, it is because Coppola falls into the trap he fell into with Apocalypse Now: too much side material makes the plot irrelevant. His muddled concept of suspense at times left me completely bored. The Mafia is often treated as a bureaucracy, with men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other, then promptly killing each other. Many of these scenes end up being ineffective.Incidentally, it is curious that although the central characters of The Godfather are members of the Mafia, the viewer somehow sympathises with them. Why? I believe I've found the answer. We never see the individual victims of crime. We never see women reduced to prostitution, a family broken up by gambling, drugs ruining a man's life. The only cop we see with speaking lines is corrupt, and promptly killed off. Although the characters are, at heart, immoral, the effects of their immorality are limitedly shown. And this might be why the characters have such appeal: instead of gangsters, they become a dysfunctional family. Thus, The Godfather, often dismissed as a thriller, is most aptly classified as a drama.For me, one of the (if not the) best scenes in the entire film is when Michael (Pacino) attends his sister's son's baptism, where he stands as the godfather. As the priest asks him whether he renounces Satan and all his works (etc.), Michael answers \"I do\". In a masterfully inter-cut scene (kudos to Coppola), this moment of the baptism is shown to take place simultaneously as several murders Michael has arranged. The juxtaposition of these two moments is highly effective (much more so, in my humble opinion, than the brutal execution of Carlo minutes later), and is one of the moments that make The Godfather the oh-so-sweet treat it is.However, despite being one of the most respected movies of all time, The Godfather undeniably is flawed (gasps!). There are so many characters to keep track of, that several of them remain sketched-in shadows. In addition, Coppola has thrown in a subplot about Michael's life in Sicily after he flees America, which is not only ineffective, but also slows down the tone of the film, and brings in doubts over just how much Michael loves his wife, a situation affirmed when he lies to her at the film's end, denying his involvement in the murders. It just feels stiff, awkward, out-of-place, and slows down the film. And of course, I think that Michael ordering his sister's husband to be killed is possibly the film's biggest flaw. Michael shows positively no concern for Connie: his only thought is to avenge his brother. Well, this relentless circle of vengeance gets dizzying at times.When it comes to acting, there's practically no argument. The Godfather is one of the best-cast films ever. Marlon Brando in particular works well. (Nay, I'll revise that-- he IS the Godfather.) His final scene, as he dies playing with his grandson, works precisely because of Brando's acting.The score for The Godfather was composed by Nino Rota, and a very effective score it was! The theme in particular seemed to melancholically say: \"If only we had listened to the Godfather\u0085\" Finally, I find it fascinating how, with subtlety, later events in the film are foreshadowed. The most brilliant case of foreshadowing occurs when a film studio boss (whose name completely escapes me) shows off his prize horse, boasting of its price and how he plans not to race it. This serves as such a clever way of foreshadowing the (gruesome, yet effective) slaughter of the horse.The Verdict: Although The Godfather is undeniably a very good movie, it has been overrated, emphasis put on its good points, yet its flaws shockingly overlooked. It's currently #2 on IMDb's Top 250-- but it should, in my humble opinion, be a lot further down the list.Overall Rating: 6.5/10", "A Wonderful Movie": "This film is truly epic, develops the characters in an amazing way, especially to Don Corleone, that he does in the film as a superior to all, with more knowledge and intelligence, based on their sense of friendship and favors. I love this kind of movies in which the protagonists or antagonists are complex beings, with ambitious and colossal ideas, and that not anyone could do. The conclusions of every act and decision that Don Corleone, or of his son, are amazing, doing all to the big, I consider at all of one of the best movies that I see in all my life, and I will never forgot the sound-track and the landscape, that is the final complement that does the movie unforgettable.", "The genuine DNA of the Sicilian Mafia film": "There will be a before and after THE GODFATHER in the movie history, and I will also say in the real life Mafia, Cosa Nostra way of life, from the inside. The screenplay was inspired by a nover written by Mario Puzo, himself helped by a very accurate documentation on this sensitive subject. Before THE GODFATHER, there were two awesome films about the true mafia: Richard Wilson's PAY OR DIE and Richard Thorpe's THE BLACK HAND, starring...Gene Kelly. Back to THE GODFATHER, the funniest is that after this movie, the Mafia goons and leaders were hemselves inspired by the film.... It is purely awesome in any sense, from any angle where you can see it. Acting, directing, editing too; and this for both films GODFATHER ONE and TWO. Thousands of films will try to copy it, with more or less success; as there will also thousands of films trying to copy other films - also starring Al Pacino ( what a coincidence) : SCARFACE, HEAT, ....It is brutal, bloody, poignant, even for the most squeamish audience. Anyone can love this film, or at the least appreciate it.", "masterpiece": "One of the all time greatest , Marlon Brando's acting at its finest , one of the best actors of all time", "The American-Italian dream": "Mario Puzo's book was gripping for sure, and so was this movie. Interestingly the word mafia is never used in The Godfather film, but maybe there was a reason for that I guess. The horse head scene is unforgettable that's for sure.Could The Godfather be made with respect for say the Yakuza or Triads?", "This film is Awesome": "While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny.", "Rusalka's twenty-seventh film review: Not the film of a lifetime": "Ok, The Godfather.  For some, this is the film of a lifetime.  But not for me.  Now that I've seen the film twice in its entirity, I still am left to wondre just what the big deal is about this film.  Granted the performances and the casting was quite powerful for its day, but still as much as this film has held itself up over time, on my top one hundred list, this one goes somewhere in the low 70's.If there were any redeeming qualities about this film it would be the screenwriter's ability to create a script from an already existing body of work and turn it into a living breathing thing as Mario Puzo has done here. The script is so finely nuanced and fine-tuned that at times as the story unfolds it as if we are watching a great symphony orchestra play.  The different plot-lines and instances just sweep over us. \nThe Godfather is not a film for children to see at all.  Yes, it is a film about an Italian family in the mafia, but still it is a very \"talky\" picture.  There is gratuitous violence that abounds within it but, it is so deftly plotted that it doesn't really stick itself out there like it was just put in the film just to be in it.  The film goes from one end of the spectrum to the other.  In one scene, these people are sitting over a nice dinner that's spread before them, in the next people are lying there with blood spilling out of their brains.  In this film, there is no happy medium to be found at all.  Marlon Brando gave the performance of the year in 1972 but, however I still think his best performance of his career was 1951's A Streetcar Named Desire.The Godfather was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning three (Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay).  Bob Fosse beat Francis Ford Coppola that year for his landmark direction of the film version of the musical Cabaret.So, all in all, you either love this one or you hate it.  My question is: What's the big deal?  It's a film!My rating: 2 stars", "I Hated this Movie": "I read a while back that \"The Godfather\" was a favorite book of an author I enjoy. I hence picked up a copy, and was enthralled. I had heard how great the movie was so I watched it, and I was appalled.I grant you, the movie follows the book closely, but it doesn't understand what makes the book work. Most of the actors know what to do, and Al Pacino is perfect, but Marlon Brando is clueless. Vito Corleone is NOT a thinly veiled thug. He is a caring man, who is forced to do some horrible things. But in the end he accomplishes far more good than evil. This only makes Micheal's transformation in the book more horrible, because the deaths he commits serve no such higher purpose.Also, scenes of great importance are removed, Johnny Fontane is barely in it, Santino's girlfriend has a cameo, and the Doctor is nowhere to be found. I know these character's don't directly effect the plot, but they give it an emotional foundation to build upon. I cared about them more than any of the other characters. I know Coppola had to cut the book down for time to do a movie, but he would have been better off doing a mini-series instead.", "This is a cinematic masterpiece": "The Godfather (1972) is a masterpiece that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Paramount+. The storyline follows an American mafia family with a Godfather who is a direct descendant from Italy. As the father gets older and close to dying and handing down his power within the family he fields a series of asks, favors and political placement requests for power within the underground world.This movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now) and stars Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire), Al Pacino (Scarface), James Caan (Misery), Diane Keaton (Annie Hall), Robert Duvall (Slingblade), Talia Shire (Rocky) and Abe Vigoda (Joe versus the Volcano).The performances by the entire cast in this movie is outstanding with especially powerful performances by Brando and Pacino and strong supporting performances by Duvall, Caan and Shire. The soundtrack and settings are legendary. This film makes you want to book a trip to Italy immediately. The mafia wedding to start the movie is so well executed and as is the evolution of Pacino's character. The dialogue is brilliantly written and the cast delivers every line with the right level of intensity. The ending a perfect way to end the movie and show the power and struggle of being The Godfather.Overall this is a cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see. I would score this an easy 10/10.", "THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. PERIOD.": "That I've seen anyway and I have seen more movies than most people except Siskel and Ebert. What else do you want me to say? Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give the best performances imaginable and the best of their respective careers as Don Vito and Michael Corleone, father and son who shall we say do not share the same frame of mind when it comes to the family biz. Don Vito is grooming his oldest son Santoro aka Sonny (James Caan) to take over from him and be the boss of the most powerful crime family in New York yet dotes on his second son Michael and sees him as destined for greatness. However, Michael, having returned from Army Service in WWII wants nothing to do with his father's illegitimate empire yet forces beyond his control cause him to become embroiled in its dirty politics despite his sincere attempts to steer clear of it. Attempted assassinations and murders quickly ensue and threaten to destroy Michael and his family that he loves. This masterpiece of art and cinema deals with many themes: love, honor, sacrifice, betrayal, and power are some of them. The central and most important one is FAMILY and that is the focus of the whole story. If the viewer doesn't understand that they will never understand this film at all. And that is why I and so many others believe this is the greatest movie ever made.", "Coppola's belief and determination saved the day": "If Francis Ford Coppolla never got his way, it's difficult to imagine just how The Godfather would have turned out. Should the studio have persisted on rejecting Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and fired Coppolla himself, the greatest film ever would surely never have prevailed.The film boasts a heavyweight cast to which nothing will ever compare. Of course, at the time of production, there were few stars on the set. But since the film's release, each of the principal players have established themselves among the world's acting elite.Mario Puzo's original novel, The Godfather, provided the basis for the movie, though it was skillfully reworked to make a smooth transition to the screen. Both the book and film have more to say than simply tell a story about crime. The complex layers of plot are woven into a exemplary insight into family, honour, revenge and love, when tainted by the deviance of the underworld.Visually, it's a spectacularly-shot film with many a thought-provoking image and beautiful music. But the real quality of the film-making process is the ability to bring out a feeling of pathos from the audience towards the Corleone family. There may be a lack of morality from virtually all of the central characters but, as is often the case when the film concentrates on the lives of certain individuals, whether they conduct themselves correctly are not, we are right behind them all the way.The Godfather legacy led, two years later, to the most successful sequel ever made. Lightning never strikes for a third time, but despite the criticisms, The Godfather Part III holds its own as a solid gangster film.The true mark of a genuine classic is the ability to survive the test of time - something The Godfather has done with remarkable ease.", "Glorified Criminals": "About: Criminals trying to whack other criminals while they are ignorant to their own bad behaviour.Story: Boring. Empty. Disgusting.Production: A good visual production ruined on deadly sins.Main intelligent: 0. Everyone dropped out of Kindergarten, it seems.UnWorthiness Level: 0Should you watch this?: No. People will believe the hype and pop culture and pretend to like films like this. In reality, movies like these are garbage, toxic and unworthy. Based on a book or not you gotta ask the author where his head was when he wrote this type of toxic garbage.Movies like this are only good when the Punisher clean house.They massacred my brain.", "The film is the star": "Often cited as the greatest film ever made, I can't 100% agree with that but along with it's immense sequel, it is certainly \"one\" of the greatest ever made. Like all celluloid masterpieces, it doesn't date. Sure some cinematic techniques alter, sound, lighting, colour and camera-work vary over the years, perhaps they're improved in general but these are transitional and often just fashionable points, not a reflection on the quality of a film.The Godfather is a ground breaking film. Slow, complex and often with no attempt to educate the audience into the \"whys\" of what is happening, you're simply invited to draw your own conclusions into the right and wrongs of this world and the characters within it. But the story itself is pure genius. Vicious yet measured, vengeful yet honourable, people centred yet set in a world where self appointed royalty are all powerful. It's a ride, rarely if ever bettered.Sometimes a star makes a film, other times a film makes the star (and actually that might be true for Al Pacino here) but in The Godfather we have a film that is the star itself. It's not really possible to pick out stand-out performances without citing them all. That is what makes it one of the very best of all time and a must see for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of Cinema.", "Old but gold . . .": "I watched this movie very late. You now, there is one quote \"Old but gold\". This is cliche but this quote equals to this movie. Atmosphere, music, actors, actress, cinematography, dialogue, writing, everythink are fantastic.10 / 10.", "1972 was the year it was released and till this day it has remained it's strength, it's magic, it's glory and doom. No need to review it, this is just one long tribute": "2 word advice: watch it. Just watch it.The rest of this review isnt a review, it is a tribute to one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. And I have seen it many many times by now and it still stands strong to this very day.Choose the restored version if you can. It has 4K images, beautiful picture quality! However great a classic this movie might be, the original movie wasnt preserved very well at all. Yes, it seems astounding to hear that such a great classic wasnt preserved with care by the filmstudio or the director himself, but when they wanted to restore the picture they literally had to search over the whole world to find parts of the original copies of this movie that were in good enough state to be used for the restoration version in 4K.The photographer of The Godfather was Gordon Willis, famously called \"The master of Darkness\" ever since he made this classic, because of his extraordinary use of low lighting techiques with very deep colors of black and dark. Especially the opening scenes with Marlon Brando are masterful.2 more things I want to mention which just mesmirise me time and again when I watch it. First, those eyes of Al Pacino. Those killershark eyes. Never before or after have I ever seen Al Pacino look so psychopatically stonecold as in The Godfather. Ofcourse Marlon Brando gets lauded for his excellent performance, but Brando oozes sympahty with his kind looks. Al Pacino just is a killer personified. It freaks me out again and again, he has become the ultimate personification of the ruthless businesslike killer mentality of the mob.Last but not least, I wanna applaud the soundtrack, that mesmirising soundtrack. Anybody knows it. I have heard it a zillion times and it gives me goosebumps time and again. Not of this earth, so beautiful. And that can be said as well of this entire magnificent classic: unprecedented power and beauty. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!", "Brilliant, Epic, Excellent": "Just paying my tribute here. Francis Ford Coppola made with The Godfather (my favorite one of the trilogy) nothing less than one of the best movies of all time and the benchmark of the genre. Everything is just excellent and timeless. Still fantastic after all those years.", "The Best Movie Ever Made": "This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life, it is simply perfect in pretty much every aspect of it, from it's acting, to it's writing, this movie has it all. It stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in his greatest performance. Michael at first tries to stay away from the family business, but after his father is almost assassinated by rivals, he volunteers to murder the responsible, and after his father dies he takes the family business leading to the second installment in the Godfather trilogy. My favorite part of the movie is the baptism scene, which showcases both Michael's descent into darkness, and Francis Ford Coppola's great talent in directing. So in summary this is simply the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life.", "Flawless": "We cant be friends if you havent watched this masterpiece.\nCall me after youre done.", "Good, but this is not what mob life is like": "I know because I knew a mob guy. This is Hollywood's glorification of the worst possible life to choose. Phenomenal acting, but the life of a mob guy is violent and depraved (and often broke). The most realistic mob movie I have ever seen is Donnie Brasco. This is what mob life is really like. Mob life is about a million miles from being romantic. Carlito's Way is another realistic (more or less) look at street crime life. you watch this movie for the phenomenal acting, not for realism in any way. Hollywood loves to capitalize off stories of gangsters, glorify it up a bit, and package it as if it were real. What's real is busting your hump, not making enough in a month so you have to sell dope, and wondering if there is a gun at your head every second of the day. to be honest, I'd rather sell staplers.", "The Godfather - Almost as Good as Godfather II": "Saying this film is almost as good as Godfather II is not a knock in any way. It is a great film. It is like comparing a BMW with a Mercedes. Both are great luxury cars, and both have several million diehard fans; just as this film and Godfather II have their admirers. I personally prefer Godfather II and a BMW. But back to the film. Brando is great, Pacino is great, Caan is intense, Keaton is good, Shire is good, and Duvall is perfect in his role. This was before napalm was invented, though. The story is riveting, and every scene is a masterpiece of filmmaking. I particularly enjoyed when Caan beat up his brother in law. I never had male in-law problems like that. However, I could have used Caan for one of mother in laws. A film for the ages.", "It's great but would've been 10 times better if it wasn't so long!": "I have to admit, this is a pretty great movie but, it's way too long for a great movie like this. I absolutely would love if this was only two hours and not three, I think it gave enough detail on what's happening of the dynasty. Marlon Brando was very much excellent at playing as the Godfather. I loved his quote \"I'll make an offer that you can't refuse\", it sounds class and like a boss. He's such a serious legend like, he actually does look pretty young to play as the Godfather, especially all the make - up and other stuff that had to be put on his face. I say it was very oily on the skin lol! I think this movie deserved 3 Oscars but I wouldn't consider it to be that serious since the length of the film was way too long! At least I finally got to see it, 43 years later!", "Mafia": "Story was amazing. Don is the Grandfather and it is his daughter's wedding. His son Michael went from being scared to fire a gun to taking over the family business. We watch him hide out in Italy after killing the two men who shot at the Grandfather five times. He meets a girl and he is struck by her beauty. He talks with a local and the local is closed off after realizing it is his daughter he likes. They end up getting married after the father is given an explanation that Michael wants to marry his daughter.

Michael returns to the US and goes to meet his past lover named Kay. They end up together and have a son. While playing with Michael's son, the Grandfather faints and dies in the garden. They hold a funeral and Michael is now the head. He ends up killing everyone who are the family's enemies and his sister's husband. We see two men come in to shake hands and greet him as Don, despite Don having died.", "My Favorite": "It is my favorite movie, I saw it many times with my family", "THE FINEST MAFIA FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN": "The title says it all.I absaloutly adore this film.Some say part II is the best but I wouldn't really agree.Excellent performances from Marlon Brando,Al Pacino and James Caan as the Family.The perfect film for a Friday night,and a Saturday etc", "What can you say?": "There is very little more that can be said about this wonderful film.  It sits proudly at the top of the IMDB top 250 and to be honest for anything else to knock it off, especially the grossly overrated 'Shawshank Redemption' would be a travesty.The thing that sticks out most for me in this movie and its equally superb follow up is the quality of acting on show from everyone.  Brando and Pacino obviously stand out but even the most incidental characters seem real and alive.  The building tension in the Slazzo/McLusckey restaurant scene is special.  Full marks all round for a wonderful piece of cinema.", "The Truth": "What can I say?  I gave this thing a 1 because I honestly have never felt it was all that good.  I that saw the average was a 9  at the time I voted and I felt the dissenters should get some representation.  Brando isn't all that great in it.  I mean the thing is better than the average film (at least I'm supposed to believe that), but 9 out of 10!?  No way.  Watch different movies.  In fact, watch other coppala movies.  I personally like 'The Outsiders' and 'The Conversation' better.  I find the story to be boring. I also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish.  I won't go into detail on this.  I will just say the thing left me dry.", "One of the greatest of all time": "This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.", "over rated": "The godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much. The roles of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated.  The direction is good not excellent,  the script is by no means ground breaking.  But many people still refer to it as the best film ever made.  Next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and wit(eg fight club) and more lavish directing.", "I'll never understand": ". . . why this movie gets such high ratings. It's a great story, but Coppola's criminal lack of attention to detail and continuity is insulting and Talia Shire's, James Caan's, Marlon Brando's and Diane Keaton's amateurish performances are distracting and laughable. Neither of them can act at all. Watch it again and I'm sure you'll agree.", "An Offer no one can refuse!!": "The Godfather is a crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Late Mario Puzo. The film stars Late Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Late Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Late Richard Conte, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton.The film is based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name and is the first installment of The Godfather Trilogy.One of the best and mesmerizing feeling i had after watching the film. The film is one of the most revered films of all time. The film displays the mafia culture in a very impressive way and the film is perfect not only technically but also narratively.Late Brando gives an astounding display of the character of the mafia boss Vito Corleone. Al Pacino is the another shining star of the film as he also portrays his character with utmost perfection. Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire were all brilliantly impressive.The screenplay of the film is engaging and impressive, the film and the screenplay has the brilliance to keep you engaged throughout despite of it's length of 03 hours.This is a one of a kind films that had set a benchmark for all the upcoming mafia genre films and also can be termed as the lesson on how to make a successful mafia films. A Must watch.", "very good movie": "good was a very good movie i enjoyed it a lotgood story line will still watch the sequels. Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.", "COMPLEX MASTERPIECE!": "If you want to write something about this movie, either you write a complete separate novel, to express everything, or you just write 6 words: One Of The Best Movies Ever! But not the best movie for Marlon Brando. No, there is no \"Apocalypse Now\" neither! By far Brando is much better in: \"Morituri\" (1965),\n\"Candy\" (1968) and, absolutely phenomenal (especially in the scene when he's talking to his wife's dead body) in \"Last Tango in Paris\"(1972). All the other actors are super exceptional: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Morgana King (Mother Corleone). But, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie is Al Lettieri in the role of Sollozzo.", "The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.": "Of all time. Of. All. Time. To have an accolade such as that isn't just impressive, it's near impossible (especially by today's standards). The consequences of acquiring such an achievement results in expectations being sky high, not just for first time watches but for multiple viewings as well. For me, it's a first time watch...the ultimate question is: Is this really the greatest film ever made? I cannot answer that, not after one viewing. It's an incredible behemoth at 177 minutes. Now I always say \"honesty is the best policy\", so with that in mind...my one and only criticism, the pace stagnates occasionally. The plot sometimes comes across as monotonous, whether that be due to the film's length or the actual substance. However, before you destroy my opinion and cast me out for lack of credibility, The Godfather is truly a phenomenal film. It's aged incredibly well since 1972 and is one of the few films I've seen where every scene is packed with rich characters, traditionalism and sharp dialogue. It's meticulously crafted. Coppola's direction was, dare I say, perfect. Nothing seemed out of place, although there was one fight scene where the punches were so far away from the actor's...but that's an absurdly minor gripe. Marlon Brando was palpable. He exhumed power, control and vulnerability. A patriarchal figure in a family struggling to stay in authoritative control in a time of corruption, deceit and betrayal. The screenplay beautifully captures the balance of the crime world and a hearty Sicilian family where traditional values are considered in both of these different environments. To most people, family is everything. The film really conveys that in a sensitive yet compelling way. Pacino was fantastic. Rita's score was utterly memorable. Puzo's screenplay was full of life. It's so much to take in one viewing that I'm sure my rating will change in the future. But I cannot deny there were moments when I looked at my watch. Some say the sequel is superior, so I have high hopes.", "Why so long ?": "Same story could be filmed much shorter.. Unnrcessarly long. In 3 hours very few things happen actually. Despite very long duration, there are still many disconnections among timelines.", "the godfather": "The Godfather is the best movie ever. No, sorry, is a masterpiece. Great script, great casting, great music, excellent acting and directing. When somebody asks me to explain this movie: \"I... There are no words. Watch it. That's all I can tell you is watch it. Then you will understand why there are no words to how good this is\"\ufeff One of the best scenes in all of cinema. The Don gives no loyalty to country or political party. He has no faith in the government or the courts of law. He is fiercely and violently loyal to his family and friends. He abides by a code of ethics. In many ways he has effectively declared himself independent of the government. He looks for no handouts from the government, and he assumes full responsibility for himself, his family, and his friends. This includes the responsibility to wage war if or when necessary. He is ruthless, but not arbitrary. The punishment must fit the crime. He is loyal to his friends, and he expects his friends to be loyal to him. Those who betray are traitors, and traitors are to be put to death. In his own way, he is a dedicated businessman, a politician, a judge, a soldier, a husband, and a father. He provides. He protects. All he asks is for your respect, your loyalty, and your friendship.\ufeffPhenomenal film.R.I.P Tessio\ufeff", "One of the finest there is": "The Godfather took the world by a storm upon its release and set the golden standard for crime films to follow, especially those of the gangster subgenre. It also continues to define the careers of many of its actors, including Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. And no wonder, the film is truly wonderful in idea, style and execution. It's also interesting to learn that prior to this film, people didn't really know that much about mafia. Apparently the real mafia even contacted the film makers and politely asked for the actual word mafia not to appear in the film. And it doesn't. Furthermore it's only mentioned once in the sequel.The Godfather is an extremely well-made film as can be expected from Francis Ford Coppola, but what I think elevated this film into such a cultural keystone is its style. It makes organized crime look glorious, operated by people of honour and respect. Yet it doesn't really shy away from the murkier aspects of the organization. Starting from Brando's Vito Corleone, the don of the family. He's an aged man, ravaged by years, and more than capable of making poor decisions. Yet he has this unbelievable presence. The same can be said about his children, all capable and controlling unbelievable resources, but each plagued by limitations, vice and corruption. Michael (Pacino) seemingly being the best out of them, but even he has his flaws, though we would have to wait until the sequel to explore them more in depth.The story reflects the same themes as the characters. It introduces an empire and then proceeds to tear it down, showing how fragile it was in the first place. If the fall of one man can take down everything he has ever built, how well had he built that something in the first place. Special mention should also go to Nino Rota's iconic score. The Godfather theme is one of the most well-known pieces of cinema music in the world, and for a reason. It's subtle, fits the style of the movie perfectly and is instantly recognizable. The music overall is fantastic, but it's that score you'll remember.The Godfather is often called the greatest movie of all time. I can see why, even though it's not my personal favourite. But it's still a masterpiece, no matter how you look at it.", "Wouldn't you fall a sleep?": "Now I know this movie is the national pride of America, but I can't help it, it's a blown up, too long, stupid movie. Now you can say oh he's sixteen, he does know anything about movies, well you're wrong!", "Its fame outstrips its strength...": "This is a very good film, with well drawn and engaging characters. It is also impeccably acted which coupled with Coppola's eye for detail really helps the world feel authentic. The script's biting criticism of American capitalism is well done and subtle. It is perhaps too subtle because people tend to miss it upon first viewing.Nonetheless, the notion that is the best that Hollywood has to offer is nonsense. While the film is is structured as a punitive plot Michael only get his just dessert is Part 3 of the saga. Morally, this film is incomplete until Michael dies along. I would not go so far as to say this film makes evil look good. But both does it straddle the line between making characters you can relate too and character you like. Vito, especially, is a bit too charismatic.The film is is actually rather rough in places. The hospital scene has a slapped dash quality to it; the wedding sequence has multiple warts in terms of night for day shooting, continuity, deep focus framing etc. Likewise some of the action (i.e. Sonny's beatdown) is stagy and false. On the whole it is exceedingly well directed but Coppola's inexperience (or studio pressure) shows up in places.This is a very good film. It is not the transcendent experience I was expecting.", "Stellar Cast, Script, Cinematography = Classic": "(Flash Review)From the opening 6+ minute long tracking shot that starts with a close up and ends over the shoulder of Vito Corleone listening to a man, the films is engrossing and much credit goes to Brando's unforgettable portrayal of Don Vito. His voice, demeanor, style and wiseness set the tone for the hefty film. While the story is highly intricate, of shifting power down the family lineage, it is also an majestic look inside the engine of a mobster family and their world which often flows from New York and Sicily. My reviews are too brief to get into plot details but the acting is top notch with a gluttony of famous actors, the pacing while slow is measured appropriately to let scenes and dialog sink in. The violence is effective and raw as well as memorable yet not over the top. This is an ultimate classic of mobsters playing angles trying to get the upper hand. Who will outsmart who and who will survive within the code of honor?", "Stanley Kubrick, \"The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made.\"": "And he wasn't wrong. After recently viewing this masterpiece of American film for the first time it is understood why it has earned such acclaim for so many years. It is hard to put into the words how beautiful and flawless The Godfather really is, all I can say is that it is the most brilliant saga of family, business, and crime ever captured on camera.One of the greatest qualities about The Godfather is its craft. The craft is impeccable in this film. This must be credited to the fantastic cast (from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino to James Caan and even to Abe Vigoda) and to one of the greatest directors of American cinema: Francis Ford Coppola. No other man could have unraveled such a craftily built epic that The Godfather is and remains today. Coppola and co-screenwriter Mario Puzo (who wrote the novel The Godfather) wrote the greatest screenplay Hollywood has seen. And it is due to the genius of both of these two gentlemen that The Godfather came to be.Two scenes in the movie that prove the brilliance of this film are the fateful diner sequence and the fantastic ending. Micheal's emotion is so ever present in that scene it is like you are right there with him holding the gun, focused on killing the man that attempted the murder of his father. You are with Micheal. Brilliant Scene. I also love the ending in which the door closes on Kay who has just watched Clemenza kiss the hand of Don Michael Corleone, her husband. Best final scene I have ever witnessed.In final, I return to my opening remarks and Stanley Kubrick's quote, \"The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made.\" To me, this statement is amazing. This came from Kubrick...KUBRICK!...quite possibly the greatest filmmaker that ever lived. That just goes to show how powerful The Godfather is. I love this movie and all who love the art of film-making are in debt to the men and women who gave us this film.10/10 If you haven't seen it, watch it. And if you have seen it, watch it again.", "Making This Movie an Offer You Can't Refuse": "All puns aside that over in the late Marlon Brando shines as Don Vito Colerone as a huge made man and would not take no for an answer when threats come to him.His younger son Michael a WWII vet hero that is uninterested in taken over the family business there. But it seems Vito has made up his mind and that Michael has a clear head and conscience to be honest.As Sonny is just way too hotheaded and that is what partly got him killed in the first movie.

He presented the story as a fairy tale. Now, every fairy tale must have its prince charming. In the case of The Godfather the prince charming is Michael Corleone. Michael is a cold-blooded mass murderer, woman abuser and cop killer. He physically beats his second wife who is the mother of his two children, kills his brother, and kills his brother-in-law thus making his sister a widow. Even his first wife, who he loved (proof that he is not completely depraved), dies violently because of her close proximity to him. He is a harbinger of death. So how can such a reprehensible and ugly character be a prince charming? Answer: By cloaking Michael in the trappings of middle class costumes and values. Outwardly, Michael is quiet, soft-spoken, well-mannered, self-controlled, well-dressed, and well-educated. He is, outwardly, a loyal citizen, a decorated war veteran, married, a father, a brother, a property owner, a businessman, and an obedient son. He has all the trappings of respectability. That sets him apart from everyone else in the story who, with one exception, are presented as being no more than a bunch of stupid crass thugs, including his two brothers, Freddie who is dumb and Sonny, who in addition to being dumb is hot-tempered. Compared to them Michael is a paragon of virtue. That makes him seem likeable, someone worthy of empathy. The only exception to the array of unsavory figures that populate this story and interact with Michael is Michael's father, Vito Corleone, the first Godfather, whose real name is Andolini. Vito was born in a part of the world still heavily influenced by feudalistic values in which vendatta and revenge-killings were the norm. If Michael is the prince charming, then Vito is the king. Despite being a premeditated murderer himself, Vito is a \"good-guy\" gangster. He resists pressure from the other gangs to get into the drug trade. A gang war ensues. Vito is shot, almost killing him. That makes Vito seem a martyr who is willing to sacrifice his life in defense of his beliefs and family. He is a king with courage and scruples. But with the king incapacitated, the survival of the family is placed at risk. Oldest son Freddie, being dumb, and second oldest son Sonny, being dead, are in no position to defend the family, leaving only Michael to take up the cause. Michael, who reveres his father, tries to conduct himself like his father, who is Michael's role model, but the norms and values that shaped his father's character are woefully out of place in the modern urban setting and applied by Michael come off as phony and contrived. As a result Michael becomes a twisted and sordid facsimile of his father. Whereas Vito was loved, admired and respected, Michael is despised, loathed and feared. Yet, he does the job of protecting the family, who are the \"good guys\" in this story, and by doing so fulfills his role as the prince charming who rescues his family when everything seemed all but lost. Michael is as phony as his family's last name. His pretensions of middle class respectability are a sham. His propensity for violence is driven by a depravity so deeply rooted in his mind and spirit that it gives cause to question whether he is still capable of showing any compassion. Yet he is the modern-day prince charming who is on a mission to protect what is his, even if it no longer exists except in his mind.", "Godacceptable": "While I feel the movie wasn't bad, I also feel like the movie has been given much more praise than it should have gotten.Well, perhaps this movie was glorious in the 1970s, I am rating it from 2013, and feel like if this movie was released now, it wouldn't have gotten as much attention. For 2013, this movie was mediocre to me.While the acting from Al Pacino was great, I feel Marlon Brando's acting was a bit too much with his soft slurred voicing of Vito Corleone. It came off a bit weird to me. If anyone spoke like that in real life to you, you would probably think something is wrong with that person.The first half of the movie was incredibly slow and boring to me.The restaurant scene was definitely good and leaving the Italian dialogue untranslated added a nice touch. The rest of the movie was just decent to me. The ending felt a bit too easy - to me it seemed like it was all done so easy, making it feel like it could have been done better.Overall, I think this movie was good, but not great.", "The Greatest": "One of the greatest movies of all time. The cast & characters were perfect.", "IMPORTANT.": "I can't believe I've lived so long without watching this. It uses every frame of its time to humanize then destroy a family, making their trade and income unimportant, and changing the world of film in the process. One of the best ever, period.", "Best": "There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale.", "it's not historically accurate to the genre or dark and gritty like i expected. slow paced over-hyped family film": "I do not understand the hype, i have tried earlier today on my second attempt to viewing this movie, i made it about 45 minutes until Don Corleone's first assassination attempt until I coulnd't sit through it anymore.I want to say again I don't understand the hype and high 9.2 IMDb score for this movie. I will try to explain for the following reasons: #1) There is a lot of hype involved because it is considered a true crime epic, well it's not even a true story or based upon one has anyone realized that? Yes , there is some elements which are relative to the crime world at the time, but no this does not do justice to the real crime families. It's not based on a true story in any way other than something like Inglorious Bastards would be, it only uses some real names and real ideas in our history.#2) The action and build up is very slow paced and makes it difficult to sit through without getting bored. The action crawls at a snails pace, it does not bother to cover the history behind how Brando's character came to be in the position of power he is in. For something with such a slow build up i am surprised they did not incorporate anything about the don and how he came to be. I am disappointed to be unable to connect with the don on any level, it is only assumed that he worked hard and is a respectable individual.#3) It does not fully capture the real danger and constant rush involved with living a dangerous life every day. It does not feel real. The first shooting scene looked bundled and strange, even unorganized. It did not look professional or scary. And second, they didn't bother to finish him off or plan this effectively it looked like an assassination attempt doomed to fail. Not to mention his bodyguard, might i add this is the DON the GODFATHER his bodyguard looked like a quivering mass of coward. For someone in such an esteemed and established position he should be able to pick more skilled bodyguards. His crony immediately broke down and cried, any true criminal knows that business comes first, avenge your boss, don't sit and cry. If i was his boss and still alive i would get up and shoot my henchmen in the face for being a chicken. Also the scene where Robert Duvall sneaks a horse head into the director's bed? Am i the only that fully can see how ridiculous that is, and the fact that it is also quite impossible? For you that don't know the movie, he gets welcomed into the directors house to discuss business, and like a sneaky petty con artist insults him behind his back and mutilates his prize horse and sticks it on top of his bed while he's sleeping. The reality of that is just crazy. First of all, a person does not become a godfather by employing low integrity sleaze balls into his direct office, that is not how the world works. Criminal organizations have a code of conduct as well, and need skilled and practical criminals to do their work, criminals who often maintain their own standard of rules and principles. If a criminal did that kind of bull he is gonna being embarrassment to his organization.#4)This film does not appeal to me as dark and epic, but family fun inaccurate to the brutality and hustle real gangsters encounter. It is a strange concept it is too long and way too inaccurate to reality.In conclusion, I Want to say as a hardcore fan of crime, and someone who has broken a few rules personally in my time I can say this does not accurately portray the genre. It is far too long and slow paced for me to sit through, i cant say that i have ever finished this from start to finish i tried twice now and don't see my self as being able to.", "Much more than a great movie": "A magnificent work of art! Timeless. Exposes all the strength and human weakness, the true meaning of family in all aspects.", "My Big Fat Sicilian Wedding": "Big shout out to Flashback Cinemas for helping me finally, FINALLY, get this off my list of shame.Of course now I'm left in the precarious position of having seen it and NOT thinking it's the best thing ever. I really wonder how much of that is due to the films own legendary status because it's impossible to go into this for the first time and not know it's supposed to be one of the finest pieces of cinema ever crafted.I mean don't get me wrong, it's good. The performances are... WHAT HAPPENED TO AL PACINO?! I didn't know he could even do this! I think my first exposure to Pacino was The Devil's Advocate and he's been pretty over the top in most things I've seen but in this he's so quiet and understated but you know there's alot beneath the surface. Brando is great. Would have liked subtitles though for him, honestly.\nI think what I most appreciated though was the way it handles the audience. These days it seems like most movies can't do anything without trying to explain everything. We get inundated with exposition but not here. Things are laid out beautifully so that just by paying attention you pick up on what's going on and who people are.There are a LOT of people though. With a lot of very Italian names. Had a bit of trouble keeping the rooster straight in my head. Fortunately this is one I'd definitely enjoy revisiting, which I can only imagine to be a deeply rewarding experience because it feels like there are a lot of layers here to explore and new things to hone in on.It's a great movie. I just don't think any movie could really live up to the massive hype machine of The Godfather. I can only imagine my estimation of it increasing though with future viewing.", "A Masterpiece and film history": "The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to. The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons. \"The Godfather\" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises. Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead. Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so \"The Godfather\" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked.", "Somewhere in my top ten": "What can I say? This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just because the acting and everything is on point, but because Brando pushes it over the edge. There is no argument about it, Marlon Brando is the greatest actor of all time, and not just because of what he does in this film but for nearly every film he has been in. And his later films are all the better because at that point, he more or less mastered his craft. But yeah, The Godfather is an excellent film. The secret behind it, other than Brando's acting is the story. It isn't a crime story but a tale about a family; most people can not wrap their heads around such a concept.", "Maybe 15 Minutes Too Long, But Who Cares?": "After all the hullabaloo I've heard regarding this movie, I came in with fairly high expectations for obvious reasons. That being said, I was still thoroughly impressed but what this one had to offer. The acting in this is top-notch and I wouldn't argue with anyone who tries to claim that this is the best acting and cast in cinema history. Sure, Al Pacino has more screentime than his counterpart Marlon Brando, but Brando's commanding presence permeates through this entire movie, long after he's been in his final season. There's no question who the true star of this one is.Everything in this movie works: from the dimly lit cinematography to the beautifully crafted score. It does get a tad slow in the middle when we're hanging out in Sicily with Michael, but the rest of the movie is so gosh-darn perfect that I have no choice but to give this movie 10 stars.", "Godfather": "All I can say is that after almost fifty years there still is not a better movie showing how the true old school way of the Italian mob at its best could not have been any better Actor or Actresses to play all the parts in this movie.

Marlon Brando received many praises for his performance but there are too many inaccuracies too mention in his accent, never mind his mannerisms.I watched this film with my friend, his Italian wife and her parents who don't speak English, and get this!!! they fell asleep!!! The greatest movie of all time and they fell asleep!!. I managed to stay awake but it was hard but my friend loved it for some weird reason, but he's an oddball so he doesn't count.Certainly does not deserve to be numero one, instead may I suggest the princess bride, a classic tale of love and adventure.", "An all round classic film": "The original and best. Marlon Brando was phenomenal in this role. Great supporting cast from everyone all round. The cinematography makes this the perfect piece of American nostalgia. Classic story perfectly executed.", "Full of iconic scenes, The Godfather is considered one of the best films ever made, influencing many other productions, with a most familiar treatment of the mafia": "In the late 1960s, Francis Ford Coppola was at the beginning of his career when he managed to take over the audacious production of Paramount Pictures' The Godfather. The Godfather tells the first part of the Corleone family saga. Commanded by the respected Don Vito Corleone, the mafia family controls illegal business in New York in the 1940s and 1950s, in constant conflict with other groups. The adaptation was written by the author of the book Mario Puzzo Puzo together with Coppola.We started the projection in an almost absolute darkness. \"I believe in America\", we hear while Bonasera's face, in close up, appears on screen. There is no external sound, only this monologue of the man who asks the Godfather for a favor. Slowly the camera moves away, demonstrating the character's fragility, his \"small size\" inside that dimly lit room. Vito Corleone's back (Marlon Brando) begins to fill the picture and a simple hand movement already transmits an order, making it clear where the power is there. The first cut comes shortly after, and finally, we see Brando's face, full of perfect makeup, which turns a man of forty-eight years old into a man of almost sixty.\nOnly through The Godfather can we truly see why Marlon is considered one of the greatest actors in history, which goes so far as to direct other actors on the scene. His portrayal of Vito is rich in details that guarantee our identification with the character. At the same time that he, the Godfather, is a fearsome man, who uses a subtle movement in order to compose his unshakable figure, he is a family man, devoted to his wife and children and who makes small and almost imperceptible interactions with everyone around you. He is a warm person who attracts anyone and does not need to openly demonstrate his power at any time. This, however, is not the story of Vito, but of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the real protagonist of the work, no matter how many believe the opposite. It is he who goes through the greatest dramatic arc that substantially alters his personality. Mike begins the plot as the least connected member of the family, a war hero who makes clear his shame about his father's business - his willingness towards his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) shows how much he wants to get away from that whole life of crime. As the plot progresses, however, Michael is led, step by step, towards what he most dislikes, being forced to defend his father, kill for him and, in short, succeed him. And how do we see the character change? Not only through the obvious, the script, but also through the nuances of Pacino's performance and the exceptional work of art direction and makeup of the production.The film is, yes, about the Italian mafia, about the nuances that made up New York society in that historic period, but, before that, it is about family relationships and commitments. \"A man who does not dedicate himself to his family will never be a real man,\" says Don Corleone, even at the beginning of the story. This sentence summarizes what The Godfather is: the process of transforming a child into a father. After the attack that Don Vito suffers, we see Michael, the youngest, war hero, favored by his father, passed over by his brothers and the only one who was not involved in the \"business\" of the family, assuming his responsibility. More than avenging the father figure, Michael kicks off the journey that would make him the leader of the family. In a clear reference to the story of biblical patriarch Joseph, Michael faces the martyrdom of distance by hiding in Sicily - which gives us some of the most beautiful sequences in the film - as he matures and sees in the circumstances that happen in New York the need to sacrifice their will to preserve their family.Michael's exile in Italy gives us an obvious shock. Gordon Willis' darkened photograph gives way to warm hues - the yellow of the earth and the green of the vegetation occupies each frame and harmoniously represent Michael's current mood. There he falls in love and there he says goodbye to much of his humanity. The cuts to New York, in this simultaneous narrative, bring us a notable discomfort: the war between the five families broke out and we remain in constant tension. Again Willis' photography comes to the fore, using classic framings, medium shots that do not deviate from the Hollywood standard, but that highlights every element of production design. Nothing is in a picture by chance - from the rose on Don Corleone's chest to the picture above the fireplace we have symbolic elements that reiterate the veiled violence of those conversations and the instability of the countless relationships portrayed.In one of the best scenes in the film, just before Vito's death, Michael talks to his father in the garden of the house and discuss the plans that would develop at the climax of the film. At a specific point, the son looks to the right and the father to the left, illustrating, once and for all, the Corleones' past and future. The sadness in Brando's eyes is placed in contrast to Mike's veiled hatred. And why do I say hate? Palms again to Pacino who shows, in every tone, the shame he still feels about himself, how much he hates being part of that - \"in five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate\" - that is his goal, to escape from the family business, shape it, as if a part of itself begged for the salvation it left behind when it killed Sollozzo (Al Letieri) and Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). This, however, fails to distance the protagonist from his transformation into a kind of villain - something that photography itself makes evident, by making him come out of the shadows in the final moments, just as he did with the various antagonists throughout the projection - from Virgil Sollozzo to Don Barzini - bringing to the fore almost a nightmare logic. Michael is, therefore, a clear antithesis of himself, a lost man, but who nevertheless remains in control of absolutely everything - even sitting Pacino manages to demonstrate the power of his character.\nBut the trajectory of the protagonist and the Corleones in itself is completed with the death of Carlo (Gianni Russo). In the opening minutes of the work we followed the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire) and in the end the same character becoming a widow. The melancholy of the narrative could not be created in a more obvious way and it establishes itself bringing with it a remarkable cohesion of the plot as a whole. We have the distinct feeling that a long period of time has passed since we heard \"I believe in America\" and, in fact, ten years have passed - again, without the need for didacticism.Coppola's direction is consistent and responsive; conducts the tension of the story in such a beautiful way that it completely escapes the common shock proposed by this type of film. Because he admittedly dislikes violence and the plot is, at least at first glance, about gangsters, Coppola redirects the viewer's focus on moments of murder, distracting them with subtle elements - an orange that rolls during a shooting or a foot that leaves through the car window during a hanging, for example - which, in the end, make up the brilliant painting of that violent environment. Likewise, Gordon Willis' photography directly assists the filmmaker in his eagerness to make that fear structure beautiful. The light always coming from above highlights the features on the faces of the actors, further highlighting the threat and mystery behind each character, collaborating decisively in understanding the duality of those people. The contrast of light and dark highlights the paradox that exists between the mobster and the family man; the outlaw who blackmails and scares and the man who at home loves and sacrifices himself. The icing on the cake of this beautiful panic piece, without a doubt, is the unmistakable theme song created by Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola (in diegetic songs). Each melody perfectly reiterates what we see on screen, from Michael's romance in Italy, with intimate tones, to the most remarkable tensions built, such as the unforgettable sequence of the horse's head. The plot's progression, of course, is also well represented by the music, as the theme music heard in the opening seconds gains a tone that highlights the loneliness that is established with the advance of the projection.Counting on iconic scenes, among the most venerated in cinema, it is in acting that The Godfather has one more of his assets, not only Marlon Brando, but Al Pacino gives us a great job in his third film role, experiencing Michael Corleone, his son Don Corleone, we have here the real protagonist of the work, we see the great change that the character expresses when at the beginning we are introduced to a young ex-combatant somewhat embarrassed or indifferent to the Family business, and at the end a great chief of the crime dealing with newly won supremacy. The end result is a grandiose film, richly illustrated in every way. A critical and public success that ended up winning three Oscars - best film, script and actor (Marlon Brando, who refused to receive the award for detesting Hollywood) and found his place among the immortal classics of cinema.There are works in the most varied fields of art that perfectly illustrate interpersonal relationships, to which everyone should have access: in painting, the expressionism of Van Gogh and Munch; in literature, Shakespeare and Dostoevsky; in music, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven. In cinema, The Godfather is one of the examples of this very limited hall. Francis Ford Coppola's film is an epic that has become indispensable for movie fans and anyone with minimal interest in art. The Godfather is considered one of the best films ever made, influencing hundreds of other productions, with elements such as the most familiar treatment of the mafia.", "To the people who hated this movie": "I realize that taste is subjective, but when I read the review of contributors to this site who pan great movies, I wonder about their IQ or their concept of quality. Unless they just love to type their venom on a page or have other emotional problems, it seems difficult for them to understand the quality of a movie Instead of saying: A lot of people like this film. It is the highest rated film in the database. Maybe I am missing something here. Maybe I do not understand what character development is all about. Perhaps I don't know good acting from bad. Maybe I do not like a certain actor and it is coloring my entire view of the movie. Maybe the movie offends my moral sense and therefore I cannot like it without subjecting my soul to hell.Or maybe, I cannot put myself in the context of the time the film was made. Sure, the phrase: 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!' is trite today. But it wasn't when the movie was made! Although the Mafia was not a new concept to most people, the idea that crime families lived like normal people was a revelation, taken one step further with 'The Sopranos.' Similarly, one cannot compare 'The Sands of Iwo Jima'with 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although both had good production values of their times, the technology of the 90's made Ryan seem to be a better picture. To summarize, before you consider yourself another Roger Ebert, read the reviews of the people who liked the movie and try to understand what they saw and why you did not fully appreciate it. Then, sit down at your computer and type, without ranting, a well reasoned critique that may be of use to others.", "fabulous": "The best movie ever, such a talented actor Brando was", "A masterpiece that will stand the test of time...": "It is no wonder why The Godfather is consistently ranked #1 by registered members of the Internet Movie Database.  It is quite simply a great film in every respect.  I won't rehash all the points that affirm why this picture is an undisputed classic that will be as relevant 50 years from now as it was in 1972.  The sequels, Godfather Part II and Part III, complete the story.  Part II got the praise it deserved becoming the first and only sequel ever to win a Best Picture Academy Award. Unfortunately, Part III suffered from too much anticipatory hope that germinated from the 16 years between the two films. In other words, the film was held to a standard that would be impossible to achieve.  It was masterfully told and with the same attention to detail given the earlier films, but a fair assessment was not to be given.  Al Pacino's performance was outstanding, especially in the final scene with his reaction to death of Mary.  It is a stunning and thoroughly heartbreaking expression of grief from a father who has lost a child.  I wrote about Part III because many have dismissed it as a lesser film not up to par with the others, but this is criminally unfair.  One last comment about The Godfather films -- some have suggested that the films are too long.  Well, that's just a stupid thing to say.  It's like the King in Amadeus telling Mozart that his composition has \"too many notes\". Mozart asks, \"which notes would you cut\"?  The Godfather films are too complex to be shortened to accommodate those with a short attention span. \nThe DVD versions of the Godfather Trilogy are supposed to be released in Fall of 2001.

The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and probably some fraction of what makes this film so memorable and beloved to this very day. Every shot is a painting within itself...mundane actions now take on this otherworldly elegance only seen in the finest novels and most stunning works of art. Just staring at this film makes it well worth the three hour length.The performances are also all spectacular, largely because of how fantastic the cast is. We all know about Marlon Brando's Oscar- winning performance, and how breathtaking that beautiful monologue of his towards the end is, as well as the fine acting efforts done by Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and (in a much smaller role) the great Sterling Hayden, not to mention wonderful supporting performances from Abe Vigoda, John Cazale, Richard S. Castellano, and Talia Shire, among plenty others. Nearly every scene is engaging and gripping, and the three hours are quite quick and the overall film flows like a steady stream of neverending goodness...there isn't much else to say about this one.

All of them are incredible.\nmust watch", "The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel": "We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of \"The Godfather,\" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel.

The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although \"The Godfather\" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of \"The Godfather\" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so \"The Godfather\" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish- brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.", "I'm gonna make a movie nobody can refuse.": "The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This has been called the greatest movie of all time by many film buffs. I prefer Star Wars a bit more though, but that doesn't mean I hate this classic. I love this movie and I can see why it has received praise across the globe.A movie that heavily involves family matters and crime of course. I'm not sure whether to call this an action film though some top critics have dubbed the Godfather as a top rate action movie, but it doesn't have the over-the-top action of Michael Bay movies. This one has better action because you can soak it in and understand what's going on, not just watch it and forget it like the action scenes in Transformers 2.\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" When you hear that line, you're in the world of cinema. When will they make another movie like this again? Let's hope it's soon. The Godfather is that kind of movie that deserves all the attention and respect it gets.", "a short comment": "It will not take very long: The Godfather is just...THE MOVIE.

It's poetry in motion, it's tender, wild, violent...again, it's THE MOVIE.", "A Personal Anecdote": "I can't believe with 652 of my unlettered reviews on IMDb, I've never written about The Godfather, the best movie ever made, maybe. What brings me out here on this occasion is my second viewing of the superb TV series The Offer which has done so much to heap even more praise on the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola film, not that it needed it.I remember before I'd even seen the movie, I heard talk of it, especially the horse head scene. I would have been about fifteen years old, and although I can't even remember when I saw the film for the first time. I remember how everyone in the world was reading the novel back then, as people used to do, you know, read. The series also talks a lot about the movie Love Story, another film that came from a novel that EVERYONE was reading back then.I have nothing new to say about The Godfather except to throw in a personal anecdote.This must have been back in about 1989 on a Thursday evening. We were at a friend's house; I think we were three couples. We were having a beer before going out with The Godfather on the TV. We'd all seen it countless times by then, but we found ourselves riveted once again. We weren't in any big hurry to leave with nothing important going on that night, certainly nothing more important than watching this great film for the umpteenth time.We may have already had our coats on when the film approached the pivotal moment when Michael is taken to the Louis Italian-American Restaurant when the screen went blank and a message appeared: To Be Continued Tomorrow Evening. We all let out a gasp. Then we took decisive action.One of us headed out to the video store (remember those?), someone else went out for beer and wine, and someone ordered pizza. We stayed in and watched the second half. Who needs to go out?", "The Godfather is a masterpiece that will hold up for many years, brilliant storytelling and a true classic": "The Godfather is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo and it's based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. Why is this film regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? It's an three hour ride of cinema of some of the finest written, finest acted, finest cinematography, finest editing, the remarkable musical score by Nino Rota and of course the brilliance that is Francis Ford Coppola. He created a masterpiece but bear in mind, though it is a movie everyone should watch, the slow pace and long length might turn some people off but if you bear with the slow pace then you will absolutely love the film. For being released in 1972 it was a very violent film. It's also full of symbolism which makes a second or third viewing so much more fun as there's so many details the director placed into its many scenes.The Godfather is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. Spanning from 1945 to 1955, it chronicles the Corleone Crime Family under patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss. There's a huge cast playing these well written characters, also some big names who're playing them. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Richard Castellano as Peter Clemenza: a caporegime in the Corleone crime family, Sonny's godfather, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen: consigliere, lawyer and unofficial adopted member of the Corleone family, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams: Michael's girlfriend and, later, second wife, Richard Conte as Emilio \"The Wolf\" Barzini: a crime boss of a rival crime family, Al Lettieri as Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo: an adversary who pressures Vito to get into the drug business, backed by the Tattaglia family. As you see, there are a lot of characters and everyone is extremely well written and some even based on real people. The whole portrayal of the mafia is extremely well done and I'm glad they did the research. Each character has a meaning to the story and there's some terrific performances in each scene you watch. Thanks to Coppola's request approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs, using over 120 distinct locations. The remaining portions were filmed in California, or on-site in Sicily. Shooting on authentic locations made everything so much more realistic and immersive, Francis Ford Coppola used that to tell the story he wanted to tell, and I think it helped a lot for the actors and look for the film.Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is truly and I mean this, among the best performances I have ever seen in my life, I didn't really find it to be the best on my first viewing but now... Just wow. He deserved that Oscar, without a doubt. Al Pacino is also great, truly terrific but in comparison to his performance in The Godfather Part 2, it's not as great as it's literally hard to top that. Though Brando and Pacino deliver some of cinema's best performances, there are still a lot of others who does some impressive acting performances, one of them being Robert Duvall who are among my favorite actors. Along with Marlon Brando, he and Duvall wear some serious make-up and prosthetics that make them almost unrecognizable. Everyone in the cast does a great job with showing emotion through the use of the facial expressions and I love that, I can't name everyone but it's an incredible ensemble cast.The film won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director. Since its release, The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. I'll agree fully with that as after rewatching this film for the second time I can only say how beautifully and brilliantly told it is, highest quality of storytelling and visual storytelling. The first time I watched it was in 2015 I believe and I loved it then, and absolute liked it a lot more the second time, it's a mesmerizing and literally breathtaking 3 hours.", "The classic Mafia movie": "It's a fictional look at the Mafia in New York City from 1945 to the early 1950s. In particular, it follows the Corleone family.The Corleone family is made of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), his oldest sons, Santonia \"Sonny\" (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), his daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a just-returned war hero who has not been part of the family business. We don't know the name of Mama Corleone (Morgana King). Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) was taken into the family as a child and is now the lawyer and chief counsel to Vito, and then Sonny, and then Michael. At the film's beginning, Michael's girlfriend is Kay Adams (Diane Keaton).The movie opens with Connie's marriage to Carlo (Gianni Russo) while Vito conducts Godfather business. We meet the family and some of Vito's Mafia associates like Clemenza (Richard Castellano) and Tessio (Abe Vigoda). We then see a war break out among the families because Vito declines to get involved in the illicit drug trade promoted by Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). The violence begins, touching all parts of the family and forcing Michael to hide in Sicily for about a year. When Vito finally dies of natural causes, Michael ends up as the leader of the family; in this position, he seeks to take revenge on all his opponents.This is the classic three-hour Mafia movie. It has a haunting, easily recognizable score. The first time you see it, the storyline is mesmerizing. It flows naturally while incorporating a complex plot. The actors, especially Brando and Pacino, are all first-rate, assisted by good direction. It has great scenes, especially the lengthy opening wedding scene and infant baptism scene at the film's climax. After watching it multiple times, a viewer might question some of the timelines presented in the movie, but no matter, it's still a great movie that I watch at least once a year. And it's forever given us the line, \"I'll make an offer he can't refuse.\"", "Incredible...": "What a truly special movie this is. Despite its violence, heavy content, and length, I could literally watch it every week. This film contains some of the most tragic, well-devoloped characters in the history of American cinema; they are simply unforgettable. Then there are the masterful performances, the beautiful cinematography and art direction, the wonderful script, etc., etc. In short, this is one of the most perfect stretches of celluloid ever.", "Simply extraordinary": "That two word summary captures my bottom line feelings about this film: simply extraordinary.This is, of course, Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film achievement to date. I frankly doubt that he, or anyone else, can surpass this film, although he gave it a pretty good run in \"Godfather II.\" Part of what sets this film apart is that Coppola took one very well known star in Marlon Brando and surrounded him with an ensemble of lesser known actors. The result is that many of those lesser knowns were catapulted into stardom themselves, particularly Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams). John Cazale is perfectly cast is the ignored middle child, Fredo Corleone, and James Caan turns in a memorable performance as the hot-tempered Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone.The subtle undertow of this film is that Coppola and Mario Puzo crafted a brilliant script that draws the viewer into a level of empathy with a family of cold-blooded killers. The Corleones are, after all, a family under siege after the surprise attack on the Don, the abduction of Tom Hagen (Duvall) and the murder of the Don's most trusted assassin, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana). The family draws closer, with the estranged son, Micahel, returning to rescue the family business from chaos. It becomes easy to lose sight of the fact that Coppola has the audience \"rooting\" for one set of ruthless murderers over the other set.The climax of the film occurs when Michael orchestrates the final revenge of the family for the murder attempt against his father, the murder of Sonny, the physical abuse of his sister, the abuse of Fredo and disrespect shown for the Corleone family in Las Vegas, the murder of his Sicilian wife, and against the traitor within the family business. Those scenes are controversial on many levels, not least of which was the juxtaposition of a number of the murders with the baptism of Michael's nephew.This film is a masterpiece of movie-making. You owe it to yourself to see it.", "A work to remember !": "Classic, contemporary, contemporary, fantastic What to say more about a film that perfectly portrays a system that existed and exists until today?! Congratulations on the job. And watch it, a must for any movie lover.", "The best Film": "Very Very Good, This is a Film to if watch everydays", "a movie beyond judgement": "Let me start not with high praise, which is a regular sentence spoken on this movie. It is a motion-picture to discuss and yes there are elements in it that are extremely ambivalent. In the context of acting, directing and all the other formal aspects this is an exceptional achievement. I cannot think of too many others that can claim to have as polished dialogue and yet believable actors. But nevertheless the aspect of presenting a family-tragedy within a mafia-clan is at least to be consumed with your mind switched on. Coppola doesn't bother to present obvious critical points of view, but he presents the members of the Corleone-Clan as business-men. They react on their surroundings in the way it is necessary and to protect their family they don't bother to kill dozens of people. It is the contrast between the loving father and cold-blooded head of the clan, which attracts so many people to Brando's performance. He is so life-like on the one hand and yet manages to mute the  questionable traits of character that would paint Don Vito as a criminal. On the whole it can be said that this is still a movie which should polarize audiences, not least due to the growing influence of mafia like structures in many poor countries.", "I didn't expect this: the synopsis kinda deceived me. Still liked it.": "The fact that it was ranked even above THE DARK KNIGHT and that it was also praised on a widespread scale compelled me to check it out. The film, in short, was too long; the first half was very slow and just one sequence before the beginning of the second half where the film actually picked up pace. The performances of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are the sole reason for watching the film, if for nothing else. But sadly, the film didn't come near THE DARK KNIGHT (though I shouldn't compare them as TDK is an action film) or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. THE GODFATHER was just a different type of gangster film which felt more like a family story, and that's great. Normally, I have seen very less gangster themed movies about family issues. Seeing a film like this seemed good as the film started on a decent note. But as the subplots started crept in, I felt underwhelmed. Moreover, the synopsis written here tricked me because I was waiting for that to happen. Had the film jumped to that thing early, the story could've not been very but still quite different. But fine, let's leave that because it's the mistake of the one who wrote that thing. Even I kept wondering what actually was the actual story of the film for the first 2 hours. Added to that, we had some serious pacing issues as mentioned above. 3 hours is too long for a movie like this. What took almost an hour and a half to happen could've been wrapped up in just half an hour or just even an hour. Performances are the redeeming feature of the film, but not all of them click. The actress who portrays Connie delivers a terrible performance, especially towards the end, when her dialogue delivery turns too laughable to handle. Also, there is some action which kicks in after long. But the fact that the director was more focused on the character development and other aspects shows up in the form of some ridiculous kicks and blows. Even though it's not too much in the film, it's just too funny sometimes that it ends up deviating a bit.It's hard to watch a film like this without taking a break. But what is special is that the film almost didn't bore me at all. One heartwarming sequence involving the godfather and his grandson touched my heart. There were no other such scenes but still the film seemed pretty good to me and the ending, poetic. Marlon Brando's performance was class apart and seemed to drive the film alone.I liked the film because it did grip me and some shootings, twists excited me. But by the time it ended, it left me wanting for more even though in this long duration it had already given way too much. I'll not really say that it's overrated, but as of today's times, it's just a decent watch. Not memorable enough.", "The granddaddy of cinema": "Excellent 1972 movie about an Italian American Mafia family, the Carleones based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo.At 175 minutes long it has always put me off but I would agree it is certainly one of the best films I have ever seen.It explores not only the gangster angle that you would associate with a Mafia film but the family angle that sways the attitude of one of the central characters Michael (Al Pacino) from a fully fledged 'civilian' US war hero to eventual Godfather of the Carleone family.The casting is fantastic and contributed to the Oscar awards and nominations. They include a grainy voiced Marlon Brando (Don Carleone not Gerel from Superman), James Caan as older brother Sonny Carleone, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire as well as the already mentioned Al Pacino as Mike.The cinematography of Sicilly, post war New York and set pieces including a horses head in somebody's bed, Sonny being machine gunned and a sunny wedding with Don indoors listening to requests for help from desperados are all memorable.The whole film helmed skillfully by director Francis Ford Coppulla. Go on make the effort and watch it. Who dislikes this film?I watched with the subtitles it certainly helped overcome some of the hard to understand dialogue. Perhaps twenty minutes could have been minced off the end? My only small criticism. Prego!", "Picture of a dynasty": "The Godfather was one of the great films that I still failed to watch, so lately I took the advantage and gave it a try. There is so much written and said about this movie already that you should probably go far more into the film to really get all the points that make this title as lasting as it has proved to be. But I'll try to sum up what went through my mind as a viewer without further knowledge of the background and making of The Godfather.First I have to say that I am not at all a huge fan of mafia films. Not that there weren't multiple good ones but the topic in general doesn't really catch me most of the time. What makes this one special is that it achieves to make plausible why people act the way they do. It doesn't glorify the mafia or paint a pittoresque picture of it, rather it shows how tired the business can make people and how even they hope for a better future for their children.You can really relate to how exhausting it has to be to be in danger all of the time, not knowing whom to trust or what to expect. Even though I'm quite sure not all the mafiosi were perfect gentlemen like described in the movie and cared first and foremost for the safety of children and innocents.The running time is indeed quite long, but since it could be characterized somehow as kind of a saga, you don't really start to feel bored. To be totally honest, even though some parts could be also told shorter, it didn't bother me at all.What prevents me from giving it a full 10 stars are mainly two aspects. First the characters, or at least some of them appear a bit stiff. Hoe Michael turns from a \"regular\" member of the family to someone that is left with one facial expression only is somehow not really believable. Which leads secondly to some plot points that I think are a bit under-explained. When Michael's wife gets killed in Italy and he returns just to tell Kay he loves her, that development just seems a bit out of the blue to me.But never mind, you see how much work and effort was put into this movie and no-one should regret seeing it. I don't think it is a must-see because after all it's message for me is not that powerful but if you are looking for a well made movie then you should definitely lay back and give it a go.", "I don't LOVE it but I liked it.": "I understand the significance of this movie and what it did for crime/mob movies that came after it. It was definitely well-made and I liked Al Pacino in it for sure. My favorite scene was when he shot Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, very well-done scene and very intense. Other than that it was good enough I suppose but I still like Goodfellas better and the other subsequent movies that The Godfather inspired.", "asombroso": "Cuenta una gran historia, cuenta con un buen elenco muy recomendada", "One of the truly great films ever made": "the Godfather is one of the best films you will ever see. This is an entralling tail of an aging mobster who must choose from his sons a successor to his position. Having only recently seen the film for the first time, and then reading Mario Puzo book, you see how well most characters were transferred to the screen. Sonny, Michael, Freddy, Clemenza, Tom, Tessio, Johnny and Kay to name but a few were all well acted and true to the book (Though Johnny Fontaine's part was cut down severely). The only exceptions were the Don himself (Pure Marlon Brando, De Niro did a much better job of playing Vito Corleone in Godfather II) and Luca Brasi, who was hardly the scary underground hitman of the book.This film is a must see.", "Slow, annoying dribble": "the worst movie by one of the greatest director. I rented this movie because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed with the garbage i wasted my time on. No Plot to hold on to throughout the movie.", "A classic of cinema.": "I like Mafia movies, I think Scarface and Goodfellas, two masterpiece, but The Godfather was never much of my taste, I find the movies very good, but not him and 2 are not movies that would speak that are better than the story , The initial scene of the film is excellent, has heavy moments, excellent dialogues, a very good script, the direction of Coppola is great, the truth is that Coppola is an excellent director, unfortunately he made more bad movies than good, the cast Is great, Al Pacino at the beginning of his movie boom, and Marlon Brando does one of the best performances of all time, from an excellent character that is Don Corleone, I think the film is very big, so the rhythm falls a little , The soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, The Godfather is an excellent film, even if I do not find a masterpiece, its quality and contribution to the cinema is undeniable. Note 8.7", "Awesome, a genuine masterpiece": "The term is far overused, but 'The Godfather' truly is a masterpiece and is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. There is little point going into too much detail with this review as there are already over 2,000 that I'm sure have covered everything that needs to be said.To summarise this film as concisely as possible: it features a brilliantly constructed, deep and absorbing storyline, first-class acting from all involved, outstanding cinematography (especially for its time) and one of the most memorable and iconic characters in film history.'The Godfather' is easily the most absorbing 3 hour film ever made and the fact that this has remained one of the most popular movies over 40 years after its release says it all. To sum it up in a sentence - 'The Godfather' is as close to perfection as any film has ever, or is likely, to come.", "Film making at its finest.": "This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre.

This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance.

There have been many books written on the subject; I recommend \"Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli\" by Mark Seal.The casting was nearly perfect. It's hard to remember that this was Al Pacino's breakout role, and Brando's resurrection. We all know the list of major and minor stars here, all of whom are at the top of their form. Worth noting that an essential part of the film's mystique is its brown-centered color scheme, something insisted on by Coppola. The movie is truly an example of a final result being greater than the sum of its parts.The words \"timeless classic\" is thrown around nowadays. If want an exemplar of the phrase, The Godfather fills the bill.", "Best of the Best": "Watching this classic in a theater only solidifies it's place as my #1 all-time favorite film.Not a false note in the film.

Take Care... Chad Castorina", "A great introduction": "Dom: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse: FAMILYThe trilogy began. It's a story about family, revenge, and heritage in a mafia family in New York. The first half was a bit slow with many scenes that I felt lingered a bit too long. However, I loved Marlon Brando as The Godfather. The way he looked and acted was cool and conveyed a respected boss. I'm not entirely convinced on Al Pacino's character's transition, still in the second half his character became significantly better and more commanding. Of course the ending was awesome and showed the ironic way that Al Pacino's character changed. Overall it's a great first third. 8/10.", "One of the best film ever made.": "The Godfather is known for being one of the best films ever made and i have to agree.The performances in the film are amazing,from the raspy-voiced Marlon Brando to the amazing Al Pacino.And Despite the fact that the film is over three hours long it compels you through the whole thing.The Godfather is about an old Don of the Corleone Mafia Family(Marlon Brando).His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.This film is a work of art that remains to this day one of the the best film ever made.10/10(i wish that i can give it higher)", "\"You never think to protect yourself with real friends.\"": "What needs to be said about Coppola & Puzo's sprawling crime epic? It redefined the language of cinema and permanently altered the pop culture landscape. It is what it is. Rewatching it for the first time as an adult though I found myself suddenly wrapped in these amazingly sharp layers of meaning about crime, the nature of society and the endless back-and-forth of violence and civility. Of course, this was already present, I'd just never seen it properly. I don't necessarily believe that it's dated terribly well, or that every single moment of it is perfectly constructed but that a film this highly lauded and well-trodden is still so gripping and intriguing is testament enough, surely?", "A fairly good mob movie, which delves deep into the murky waters of the crime world.": "When I first went on this site, I was so excited what the top movie was I nearly exploded. When I saw that this prestigious position was taken by the Coppola classic, The Godfather, I was like \"Ah, not what I expected, but it seems deserving.\" When I actually rented it out in the hope that it would be the best movie ever, I was quite shocked. What I'm trying to say people is DO NOT expect it to be the best movie ever made, because it is far from it. It takes SO MUCH out from the original book that you'll wonder if the book and the movie are written by the same person.That's not to say this movie is bad, but rather it misses out on so much from one of the greatest books I've ever read. Where is the Adventures of Johnny and Nino!? Where is the vaginal surgery?? Why isn't Doctor Jules in this movie?! Why the hell did they make Tessio insignificant? Why didn't they let you know more about Paulie Gatto?? The only reason you'll want to see this is if you are a mob movie fanatic or so you will understand the 2nd movie more (which by the way is in every respect better).

The last poignant moment of the movie with Michael Corleone in reflective mood, is in my opinion, one of the classic scenes in cinematic history.

The people who made this movie excelled in every facet.  The writing, direction, and cinemetography are all superb, and there isn't a bad performance in the film.  Coppolla captures the look and feel of New York in the late 1940s, then introduces us to an underworld of his own creation.The opening scene, the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone, is the longest wedding scene I've seen in any movie and not a moment is wasted. Virtually every character and plot twist that appears later in the movie is introduced here.  When the baker mentions to the Don the Italina POW his daughter wants to marry, we never see the boy, yet he shows up at the hospital later in the movie, just before Michael's introduction to McCluskey.Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is so strong, his presence and his character so dominate the picture, that for twenty years it never occurred to me that the title character was not Vito but Michael.  It was not until I was an adult that I realized that the tragic conflicts in the picture were Michael's and not Vito's.  Vito's time and world were fading and it was time for him to leave with it.  Michael subordinates his personal dreams of achievement outside of the family to serve the family when it needs him. Once he's drawn into the family concerns, he is trapped.  As he takes on the responsibilities of family leadership and grows as a man, his options outside the family diminish and he loses the freedom to be the man he had hoped to become.One of the things movies give us are the images that stay with us.  This movie is full of them:  Sonny's beating of Carlo, the mass murder interposed with the baptism at the end, a disconsolate Fredo on the curb, Vito in the garden with his grandson, and of course, the horse's head.\nThis movie gives you something new each time you watch it.  Rent it this weekend.", "Rewatching \"The Godfather\" with my friends for the first time on the Big screen": "I had the pleasure of Rewatching \"The Godfather\" with my friends for the first time on the Big screen, a movie theatre here in morocco offered us this masterpiece in 4K and we couldn't refuse, and man oh man what a Magnificent experience that was.", "The first is always best": "1972's \"The godfather\", or to be more exact \"Mario Puzo's The godfather\", was based on his own book and adapted to screenplay by him and the director, Francis Ford Coppola. The movie stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and many others and it received three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Brando which he infamously rejected as a protest directed against misrepresentation of Native Americans in the movies. It was a fine gesture by Marlon considering that I personally would call his character a supporting one and Pacino's Michael was the true lead but that's up for debate.I'd also add that this movie, in my eyes, marked the final shift from the Old Hollywood to the New Era which can be paralleled with this picture's titular characters. Brando's Vito Corleone is an old patriarch of the family, adored and respected by many and feared by just as many. His son Michael on the other hand is a newcomer, fresh in this world that he has to adjust in and live by its rules. His struggle, his inner battle between what he wants to be and what he has to be in order to protect his family and close ones is the core of the movie and that's why I think of his character as a central, pivotal to the story and plot more than that of Vito's.What is there to say about \"The godfather\" that hasn't been said too many times already? It is one of the best crime dramas ever; the performances here are top notch, outstanding cinematography, little outdated but not less impressive special effects, fantastic music score by Nino Rota and Mr Coppola's masterful direction bring this motion picture to the hall of the greatest cinema pieces in history and put it onto top shelves with ease.", "As others suggested Overrated is the right definition": "I have recently watched Godfather again and my initial opinion did not change. There is a story but characters are superciliously described. In some cases they do not relate to the story completely. The competition among rival gangsters should have been better described to the audience.There are other movies also leaves an uncompleted feeling at the end of it, but this one is different. The main components of a movie is missing,a lacking integrity included at its ending.Ladies and gentleman, I admit it could make a few good entry episodes for a gangsters TV series, which it did in a way in the long run but overall, this movie deserves nothing close to its current position in the IMDb top movies list.", "yeetr": "YeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeetYeet", "One of the greatest movies ever made 9/10": "Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo created one of the greatest movies ever made and that's a fact: the story of Michael Corleone rising to power and becoming the successor of his father. This story is also about family, betrayal, honor, power, and fear of life of others. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are simply the best in their roles. Top of their careers. The cinematography of shadows by Gordon Willis (prince of darkness) is the best cinematography ever seen. How the characters are always in the dark, half of their faces are covered in the dark to show their evil nature and the other half of their faces is in bright light to show they are family and they have weaknesses. My favorite sequence is when Michael's nephew is born and baptized and in the same time all the family headmasters are killed one by one. When Michael is being asked if he renounces the devil and says yes, All the enemies are being killed one by one and Michael is aware of it. Not only he lies but he becomes the only thing he wanted to stay away from... The Godfather.", "One of the greatest movies ever": "After 50 years, this movie is still going strong! The cast produced a superb performance. Ford Coppola made it all possible. I can watch this movie again and again...A Masterpiece for many more years to come.", "review": "This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. As well Marlon Brando was amazing in this movie.This is definitely a masterpiece.", "Just a question!!": "I just need to confirm the name and location of the restaurant in which Michael shoots/kills Solozzo and McCluskey:Is it Louie's Restaurant on Gunhill Road & White Plains Road in the Bronx????I have been in debate about this information with a friend.

Since their debut in the 30s of the Golden age. Classics such as The Public Enemy and White Heat spotlighted the criminal life. Viewed as a true grit crime drama that not only entertained audiences but made one dream of that lifestyle with all the pros and cons. Eventually, mobsters began to faze out in favor of other genres primarily westerns. In 1972 Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Francis Puzo forever changed how gangsters were depicted with the Godfather. It took organized crime and brought it into a realistic depiction not ever seen before. Based on the Novel by Puzo, The Film follows the lives of the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The Godfather most feared, respected, and powerful Criminal in New york. We follow over the years as Vito gets older and begins to lose power, all while through reluctance his youngest Son Michael decided (Al Pacino) slowly comes to power as head of the Family. The reason why the Godfather has the status that it does is because of its tone it gave gangsters more a romanticized sort of Glorifying the Mob. Here you have this family that has all this power and respect. Its cultural impact depicted them as real people as opposed to just cutting out stereotypes. Even though it is a gangster film it is more so about the family than one of the major themes. The way families act. The use of its beautiful soundtrack and the dialogue add more Authentic appeal to Italian culture. The film shook waves with its more realistic dedication Death and the Violence felt more real from being shot to ridden with bullets. Gives a taste of what life in a family like this was like or could be like. The acting is top-notch from everybody in the from James Caan as Sonny, his attitude very traditional wise guy quicker to anger and aggression. Diane Keaton is sort of the naive love interest. Though the two who make the film the most are Brando & Pacino. Overwhelming development Brando's Godfather is iconic everybody has been inspired by this character. This character has been spoofed and parodied in so many things. Like Carmine the Roman Falcone from batman. He comes off as a man of honor, while in the context of this film you really don't know anything about him just more so how he's built up. However, the way Brando speaks and how he carries himself you get the idea that this is a powerful man. He honors his family he understanding the plights of those who come to him on the wedding day he's not a pushover, but he fair in a way. The progress that Al Pacino handles well from the beginning he's more so innocent out of the family business., but as the movie goes on and the events that occur can kinda see how to ends up where he does it doesn't feel like you question why he goes down this path. How his mannerism changes it's is a different person by the end. It's classy, thematic it's. Groundbreaking if not for the godfather there wouldn't be gangster media like there is today.", "Balee": "Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.", "DEFINITELY the most overrated film ever made!!": "Whenever you hear about this film people always put it on a pedestal about how amazing it is and how its the 'best film ever made' etc and its rated on this site at 9.2. I Honestly cannot rack my brain to come up with an answer to why it's rated so highly in peoples opinion! The problem with this film is that so many more films have been made of this genre with similar story lines since The Godfather was made...an unfortunately for The Godfather....the others have done it much better (Casino, Goodfella's etc).It's ridiculously long, I do enjoy a lot of long films, however if it is to be so long then it has to be exciting to keep it going. The Godfather is so so slow paced! And people always go on about Marlon Brando's 'amazing acting' in this...all he done was stick his jaw out a little and mumble all his words! Al Pacino's character is much more interesting. One of the most overrated, boring films I've ever seen...apart from Part II which is even worse! And I've not attempted Part III yet!!!!", "I don't think i could write a title.....": "The Godfather... 3 Oscars... NONONONONONONONONO!!!!!!! This film (And its others) Is THE worst piece of rubbish i have ever endured!I feel that it was an insult to my backside who was forced to grow carbuncles under the weight of such mafia slush. the acting is terrible, the premise is horrible and the time is awful.They made more than 1? yes. were any of them good (and i'm not biased, i always watch things till the end to get a full view... i even watched the others although i hated it) no.. all awful, all too long, need i say more?My view -10/10", "Disappointed": "I was expected a lot from this movie as it is ranked in the second place of IMDb top movies. I know that my opinion is oppose to the majority but here is my opinion. The Godfather movie is quite boring for me. The actions and everything are quite slow and in monotone. The shooting scene in the movie was radiculous and not realistic. The shooting is quite bad as it is an old movie which I understand. The story line is quite simple and quite straight. As I watched this movie, I forced myself to not fall asleep. The only good thing from this movie is the acting and also the music was on point. I would not recommend this movie for those who don't like slow pace movie or even a classic movie.", "No headline can do this film justice.": "First of all there is not a performance in this film that is not excellent from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and the rest of the cast right the way down to the dog running after the child on a bicycle on the suburban street. Al Pacino possibly gives in my opinion one of the greatest performances of all time. Michael Corleone a Man having just finished his service Wants nothing more than to have as normal life as possible despite being from a leading New York organised crime family.The film has seemingly mundane business meetings that just spurt in to violence out of nowhere and usually quite calmly. One scene in particular that stands out is when Clemenza the family muscle organises a garotting out in the sticks with the Statue of Liberty in the background and then in the next scene he's actually cooking meatballs and telling everyone the recipe. All the types of characters you get in any organisations management team are there. From Sonny who is unable to control his emotions. Tom Hagen the Foster son turned family lawyer who plays everything by the company book and Fredo a man who is just out of his depth. They treat everything as if it is normal business but murder is just a routine daily thing that needs to be done.After Vito is nearly gunned down, Michael exacts his revenge by killing the two responsible and then flees to Scicily. We then see him hiding in Scicily and then it is like seeing a coming of age drama interspliced with the aftermath he has left behind. Leading to more murder. After Michael marries a Scicilian woman who is murdered in a car explosion. He returns to New York and a year passes and he gets back with Diane Keaton. He takes over the family business. Then Vito dies. He then becomes Godfather to his Sisters child and during the christening he organises the murder of all of his rivals. Al Pacino starts the film as a man who wants to be clean and have no part in organised crime and ends it as a Man who can organise murder on a mass scale including his brother in law and not even show the slightest emotion.Absolutely incredible film, incredible score and incredible dusty orangey cinematography.", "And Now for Something Completely Different!": "I saw this film (at the theater) as a kid in the 70' upon its initial release. And, of course, was impressed. Marlon Brando is my favorite actor and I like all other actors in the film. Everything in this movie is just great (anybody noticed Gordon Willis' work?).I can understand why all the fine young Americans consider this to be the best movie in the history. It's American (it seems that nobody knows that cinema exist \"also\" outside the USA, in fact a 100 years of great art of film-making), it's \"kill-kill-kill\" (main theme in American movies), it's about family (another main theme), it's entertaining (nothing to think about, let's go to the movies, have fun, popcorn and stuff) and so on.The fact is that The Godfather is a great American movie for Americans. I like very well made films and I like this movie, but it is still \"just\" a MOVIE.If you are among those who consider this movie the best in the history, you should start watching the real great ones, masterpieces that can teach you something about yourself or even change your life.Ever heard of Kurosawa, Bunuel, Tarkovski, Bergman, Fellini? Not to mention American directors (if you hate 'foreign' films, forgot to read subtitles etc.): Welles, Kubrick, Altman, Lumet... And the Japanese (Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinugasa), Chinese, British (Schlesinger, Russell, Parker, Greenaway) and so on and so on.Please, go and educate yourself. Your mind, heart and soul will thank you for that. All you need is to be curious and open-minded.I consider myself lucky to have a chance to see at least 100 'better' films (in every aspect) than The Godfather. And I have still a long way to go. Good luck to you all in your 'search' for the art of cinema.My vote for The Godfather: 9/10.", "Still a brilliant masterpiece 50 years on.": "Based on Mario Puzo's novel, Francis Ford Coppola's epic crime classic The Godfather still stands as one of the finest and influential films of the 20th century. The Godfather features an all star cast with Marlon Brando headlining the movie and also starring Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Diane Keaton.Aging mafia boss Don Vito Corleone (the late Marlon Brando) known as The Godfather is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man and shows kindness to those who give him respect but is ruthless against his enemies. Vito has three sons, Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (the late John Cazale) and a daughter Connie (Talia Shire). Michael is Vito's youngest son and a decorated US Marine who served in World War II. Michael remains adamant that he does not want to be a part of the family business. Sonny is hot headed who sees violence as a solution to all problems and impulsively makes rash decisions. Fredo is the weakest of the family and knows that no matter what he does, he can never live up to the families reputation. Connie is Vito's daughter who gets married as the beginning of the movie Carlo Rizzi (Giani Russo) who would later become abusive towards Connie. Other members of the Corleone family include the consigliere and head lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and street bosses Pete Clemenza (Richard S Castellano) and Tessio (Abe Vigoda). Following a number of fateful events, Michael eventually becomes drawn into the Mafia and eventually takes full control of the Corleone family amidst an outbreak of a mob war which could tear the family apart.The Godfather would be the highest grossing film of 1972 and also received overwhelming critical acclaim. The Godfather would win 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor for Marlon Brando (who declined to accept the award), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo. To be honest, it deserved more Academy Awards and Francis Ford Coppola was robbed of the Best Director Academy Award, losing out to Bob Fosse for Cabaret (1972).The Godfather would be followed by The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990).50 years on, The Godfather is still a brilliant masterpiece. Everything about the movie including the story, the cast and score is still amazing. What more is there to say? It's certainly a movie that will age gracefully over time and will still be as enjoyable as the first time that I watched it.A true classic that earns a well deserved 10/10.", "\"It's not personal, Sonny.

The score is beautifully done and made me want to open a bottle of wine to enjoy while watching this movie.

We are given an insight into the lives of the Siccilian mob in America during the post-ww2 area through the Corelone family, its most notable members being the leads played by Al Pacino and his father Marlon Brando. The Oscars received were of course completely justified, Brando, being at his peak during the 50s and 60s, sells it in this one and gives the performance of a life time. Don Vito Corleone stands as one of the most iconic movie characters of all time.Pacino, though at his height in the sequel, is still fantastic in this one, playing a man who is tragically dragged into a life destined for him that he never wanted.The cinematography is fantastic, and so is the writing - it is a sophisticated, yet very violent and melachonical story that does not shy away from ruthlesness, one of the best scenes being towards the end of the third act, which I will not spoil here.It stands as one of the highest rated movies on IMDb's 250 list of best movies of all time, which is not an overstatement in any way.

The film has gone down in cinematic history, and is lauded as one of the greatest American films ever made. Not only was it the highest grossing film of 1972, but it went on to win three Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Marlon Brando who famously declined the award. Along with Brando the film stars numerous actors who went on to become household names such as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and James Caan among others.The film focuses on the Corleone family who are one of the major mafia families operating in New York City at the time and only one generation removed from their immigration to America from Sicily. While Vito, played by Brando, is the head of the family the film focuses on his youngest son Michael's rise to power after Vito is shot and later passes away. Michael, played by Pacino, understands and appreciates the family business, but starts on the outside as a more straight laced, by the book member of the family rather than the rest of his mafia entrenched siblings. It becomes clear as the story progresses, though, that Michael must transform and take the reins and usher the family into the future, and in doing so he must shed all of his nicety and embrace a more pragmatic and brutal method.There is almost nothing you can say about the 'The Godfather' that is not a superlative from the production itself such as directing, cinematography and music to the story which is broad, sweeping and empathetic yet also intimate and heartfelt. At the time all people thought of gangsters and the mafia were the exploitation films of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. There hadn't been a serious movie about these people to that point. The actors in 'The Godfather' are all operating on another level. It is clear why Brando was so key to cast in the film as it is unimaginable, at this point, to think of anyone else as Vito Corleone, and the film took an unknown, soft spoken Pacino and made him a star. Puzo and Coppola's script is brilliant smashing the idea that an author could not adapt their own work. If there is one criticism I have with the story it is how Michael deals with Kay. She was Michael's girlfriend and when Michael must flee the country after he commits a double homicide she is just cut out of his life. Michael woos a local girl in Sicily, marries her and becomes a widow before returning to America. Once back he waits a year to approach Kay and reestablish a romantic connection. I felt that whole storyline was problematic and in poor taste, but in the grand scheme of the story and production it is really a small complaint. This film is universally praised and deservedly so. It has stood the test of time and has cemented itself for all time as one of the greatest American films of all time.Eric's Grade: A.", "The quintessential film": "\"The Godfather\" is not only the greatest crime drama ever made, it is true perfection in every cinematic aspect. Coppola's directing is flawless, the performances and casting could not have been better, and the story based on Mario Puzo's novel is incredible in its intricate portrayal of a number of years during the twilight reign of an aging mafia Don, as he begins to disassemble his leadership over the family's business affairs and hand them over to his sons in the midst of an all-out war between New York City's Mafia families.The editing is superb as there is not one scene in the film that is over or under done in any way. Indeed, every minute of the film is perfect, and I do not say that lightly. It is an extraordinary achievement and the confidence that Coppola demonstrates here cannot be understated. He masterfully moves the story from America to Sicily, and through the years without any blatant indication. Unlike what was to come in its wake, \"The Godfather\" manages to be violent but never gratuitous, which adds to its beauty and reinforces the point that what we are watching is splendid and perfect film-making. There is so much going on in the story, and plenty to watch out for, that it is a film you can watch and enjoy time and time again. The cinematography is breath-taking, the music strong and poignant, and when the going gets tough, it is very suspenseful and your heart will be beating rapidly. It is not only the quintessential crime film, but it is, as many polls and lists will tell you time and time again, the quintessential film. A riveting crime saga, a powerful family drama, and a nerve-shattering character study as we watch the fall of one Don, and the rise of another.", "The Don of all movies": "It is widely known that 'The Godfather' is one of the five or ten greatest movies ever conceived. About three months ago, it celebrated its 50th anniversary, and was beautifully restored by a group of immensely talented people. I saw the film at a special screening at the Paramount lot theater, and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had watching a movie. Not only was I illuminated and electrified by the masterpiece up there on the screen, but I was also admiring how great the movie both looked and felt. I had always known that the film had become grainy, and even the first time I saw it I could tell. The restoration makes it look just about flawless.It's a flawless movie, a life changing movie, a film changing movie... it's a movie with composure that Coppola hasn't lived up to since, or for that matter, I don't think any director has since. Coppola's direction is so precise, concise, efficient, lean and organized, and has beautifully intertwined pacing. If it's not the best movie I've ever seen, then it's certainly the most beautifully choreographed, wonderfully paced I've ever seen.The beautifully constructed and rich plot follows Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Don of a postwar organized crime family, who's getting older and older. After a series of complicated events, his leadership shifts to the youngest of the family, Michael (Al Pacino). At first, Michael is hesitant to break into such brooding and dark territory, but slowly transforms into somebody that he thought he'd never be. The cast also includes James Caan, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, and Lenny Montana.Every sequence is designed with such passion and craft that it is hard to not be completely sucked in. My favorite scenes are the wedding sequence at the beginning, which Coppola intertwines with meetings with the Don, and the scenes with Capt. McCluskey, a corrupt police captain, eating dinner with Michael. I will not spoil anything. I think this is a film that everybody must see. It is an element of modern art; little has achieved such a high status. It's unquestionably a masterpiece, and a movie that brought American popular entertainment to the ranks of the foreign masters. It was a joy to see it again and absorb so much.It's probably the best movie I've ever seen.The Godfather (1972)4 STARS (OUT OF 4)Directed by Francis Ford CoppolaWritten by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford CoppolaStarring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and Diane KeatonRated R175 minutes.", "A movie about men": "To man: don't remember to hate your opponent, it will make you lose your mind.", "Best movie ever made in Hollywood": "First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely . It is the best movie ever made in Hollywood . Probably the best movie on the previous century . It indicates how important can be a family bond . Vito Corleone's quotes - I gonna make him an offer he can't refuse made him more special to me .", "I liked it": "Liked it a lot. being is a biy slow but it works i guess.", "yeah": "It's considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got tits and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women.It would be obvious how paper-thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didn't propel it into something approaching three- dimensionality. I think I prefer Goodfellas because it deconstructs everything this movie is, and is a much more natural, interesting movie in the process.", "A masterpiece, from the master, Francis Ford Coppolla": "Easily Marlon Brando's best performance. James Caan's best performance, and Al Pacino steals the show. Al Pacino's performance is not as good as the one from Dog Day Afternoon, but still up there as his second best performance. Arguably Robert Duval's best performance ever. Off course we must mention Al Pacino's dear friend (also from Dog Day Afternoon), who plays his older brother Fredo, John Cazale; an amazing performance, that he will top in Godfather II. I also need to mention that Johnny Fontane, played by Al Martino, is most likely based on, or at least inspired by, Frank Sinatra... And we need to mention the iconic music, the only score that ever came close to Ennio Moricone's music. In fact the maestro, Ennio Morricone, performed that tune more then once. Some people call this movie the bible... That might be a bit cynical, but it simply is the most quoted movie ever. \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\"", "Slow,boring but still a good a movie": "Yeah it's a good movie but I can't accept that this is regarded as the greatest film of all time...come on...there are a lot of films which is worth enough to reign the crown of being the greatest film of all time such as Shawshank redemption, Schindler's list and much more...but seriously cannot accept that this one is the best film of all time... whatever.... there's nothing much to say...but I really appreciate Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's performance it was actually great... that's all I wanna say.", "Mario puzzo; unread book but seen movie.": "Italian Mafia who kill and go rich; government takes their money.

However, I only saw it in 2015 for the first time, so my impression of it is different to those who have grown up with it. I thought the film was brilliant, some really powerful performances and many huge stars now in their youth; Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and James Caan. The film has not aged well, but is still gripping and interesting, and in place visceral and emotional. James Caan as the protective older brother was memorable but of course Marlon Brando stands out as the much parodied, copied and admired main character to whom everyone defers. As I said, the film has dated and his prosthesis padded mouth doesn't look so good as I imagine it did when first released, and the make-up on Pacino was also distractingly bad. The film jumps forward in time quickly, and doesn't explain anything, as films are wont to do more latterly, which is refreshing, and the plot is complex enough to require full attention, and whilst it's not a laugh a minute \"enjoyable\" film, or about subject matter which is pleasant, is bloody and violent, it is worth watching and certainly one of cinema's most brilliant masterpieces. I think my impression of this film is lessened by the fact that I didn't see it for until now so didn't have the loyalty to \"The Family\" that longtime watchers have, when they've grown up with it, but it was amazing to finally see the original from which many other films have taken their cue or inspiration.", "Very god movie but to me, not worth a 9 or 10": "Very good movie, no doubt!However, I suspect a nostalgy bonus in the ratings.Despite a 70s movie, you will find a very modern way of story telling, scripting, image recording and actor skills.You won't feel as being watching an \u00ab old \u00bb movie.Actions are held realistic, there is no exaggeration, which makes everything credible.But honestly, there are many modern movies that get worse ratings but that are not less enjoyable.", "\"The Godfather\" needless to say defines what is a classic movie.": "\"The Godfather\" needless to say defines what is a classic movie, not too intense scenes, but the lines the actors' action manner each stamp heart, think of the movie is an excellent work, but to savor found him to be a god, the last time have this feeling of watching the shawshank redemption, \"the shawshank redemption\" is more reflected in terms of plot found, character is also very successful, I am most impressed with is to depict the warden, perfectly. \"The godfather\" is also very successful, but \"the godfather\" mainly depicts a few characters, the old generation of godfather calm, calm, deep eyes, with a vague tone about the dignity of men, \"I will make him an offer he can't refuse\" let me have a deep respect for this role. Another mission portrays sonny, the older godfather's eldest son, who is hot-tempered and bent on revenge after his father is shot. In one role is the godfather's youngest son, the second generation godfather mike Stoic, profound. Compared to his father, the old godfather was a majestic lion, and mike was a lonesome Wolf. Not much was said about the other two because of his admiration for the old godfather. But there is no doubt that their portrayal is extremely successful.", "ILL GIVE YOU AN OFFER YOU CANT REFUSE!!": "For a long time I struggled to watch this film, wasnt a fan, thought it was overrated but decided to give it another go after such a long time and I fully appreciate it now. The writing is fantastic and the characters are portrayed wonderfully. It is a long film but it doesnt feel overly long as everything in it was essential. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were absolutely flawless.", "Wait, films like this used to exist in the 70's?": "I'm gonna be a little too honest here. I only watched The Godfather in peer pressure. I don't even like old Hollywood films. I always start feeling drowsy while watching them. Not only is the camera quality too bleak, but the accent of the time was also very illegible. But this one was fun to watch. I saw it on Prime Video and took multiple sittings to watch this. I finished it 6 months ago but I remember seeing it like it was yesterday. Being from India, I have always thought of 70's films to be very family friendly and musical. But this isn't one of them. This one, in simple words, is metal.The Godfather is probably what has inspired an entire genre of crime films. It is like what Star Wars is to fantasy, or what Superman is to the superhero genre (man, all 70's films have been so revolutionary in Hollywood). The whole idea of two groups of mafia fighting out each other in the most brutal way possible gave rise to Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Gangs of Wasseypur, the Mafia game trilogy, and even this film's two sequels. That is the amount of cultural impact this film has left. Don Corleone has become a household name now.The action scenes, the music, the acting, everything is legendary. I legit screamed at the scene where they put the horse's head in that man's bed. We see many times people learning acting by watching The Godfather films. The only problem I had, however, was what I said in the beginning of the review. The sound is not clear at all. When Vito Corleone speaks he sounds like he is swishing saliva in his mouth like a washing machine. It almost feels like the captions are saying something completely different from what the captions are saying. I finally gave up and switched to Hindi because the English ADR was so bad.I really wish The Godfather was a standalone film. It has one of the most satisfying ending in all the old films. It really didn't need those terrible sequels which don't even have a Hindi dub. Although it has been almost 50 years since it released, it still feels like it would spark outrage among certain sections if a Bollywood adaptation would be made. Definitely way ahead of its time. I would have recommended it to everyone, except everyone I know is either not interested in cinematography or has already seen it.", "Prefer the word \"Overrated\"": "No doubt, it's a good movie or we can say better than many gang star or mafia movies. But, it's really overrated, I give a watch after seeing its viewers review \"the best\" & ranked 2nd in imdb rating.Trust me it will bore you until Micheal take over his family business and excluding some part of DON CORLEONE.This movie remained silent in describing the characters or some incident to viewers. Even the storyline ,tbh it didn't amaze me at all. More, it doesn't even show the business which they tried to show the main motto of the families. Rather,it engaged you with the fighting, sometimes left u to think why is it happening? No proper reaction. After Micheal takes over ,it shows one deal of business in Vegas .So as a whole, the movie gets into track after MIcheal turns in business.Some killings may got more attentions in the movie.Gradually the interest will shift from DON to Micheal. The development Micheal,yeah that really make the movie great. Besides,the acting of Don Corleone is perfect .", "One of the five or best films of all time.": "I'm unusual in that I1) read the Mario Puzo novel in it's entirety prior to seeing the original film in the early 1970s2) I saw the film in first run theatrical release when I was 12 or 13.3) my initial reaction was comparing the film to the book.But time went on, and I rewatched this film many times, and I began to see this film, and indeed, the book, in a very different light, the light of the struggle of ethnic immigrants from Southern Europe to make it in an America that was ostensibly equal to all, but in reality discriminated against Jews, Italians, Greeks, Armenians, et al.Family, Clan, blood feud, take care of your family first, these were themes that resonated with me quite strongly as I rewatched this film.\"A man, to be a man, must have family,\" says Don Corleone in the powerful opening scene. The ritual of being godparents is powerful in the Catholic & Eastern Christian churches in a way not understood well by American Protestants.Ostensibly a movie about the Mafia, but really a show about Family, and loyalty to family.One of my very favorite films.", "10": "If this is not a 10, what film qualifies for a 10?", "Unbelievable - this is Number 1? ?": "A good job I saw it when it was originally released in the cinema.Because it has never been worth watching since. I usually lose interest after the first party sequence.At the time this was a groundbreaking film, with an excellent performance from Marlon Brando, it's easy to see why they paid him his astronomical fee despite his short time on screen, and it could well have been a momentous flop without him.But this film definitely does not stand the test of time, unlike say 'Goodfellas' 'African Queen' Spartacus etc, very few films do. How it got to number one is beyond comprehension, a very minor classic at best, which has since been done to death by the even more inferior clones, nowadays all very dreary and boring. 'Lawrence of Arabia' now there's a film really worthy of the number 1 spot.", "Greatest Movie of all Time": "Yes. It's that good.This is one of the only films that I can watch, and still notice that detail more with each viewing. This is one of the only films I've watched that hasn't got one flaw. This is movie was the greatest film experience i've probably ever had (This and Scorsese's Goodfellas, Taxi Driver & Raging Bull). These reasons alone should get everyone who hasn't seen it, to see it. - Because you haven't lived until you've seen this film. Al Pacino is absolutely amazing. The greatest thing about the trilogy however, is Michael's eyes. Oh my god, especially in part II. It is amazing. WATCH IT.10/10", "Man's bible": "I did n't understand when I was young, but I was not mature enough at the time. Now it seems that it can indeed be said that it is a man 's Bible.In the United States in the 1940s, the mafia represented by the godfather Corleone fought openly for the benefit of their families, full of men's scams and conspiracies.The godfather Corleone is one of the mafia leaders with political resources. Because he refused to expand the drug business with other mafia, he was excluded by other gangs. People in the family were killed one after another. Corleone was almost killed, but he Always keep to the bottom line of non-drug trafficking. After the death of Corleone, his youngest son, Mike, took over his father's class. He was calm, cold, and even cold-blooded, and he was vicious, gradually letting the family grow stronger and become the godfather of the new generation.In the film, the director showed the image of a man who is a godfather. He has good insight and sensitivity. He is concealed, knows to adapt to the current situation, knows the good and evil, and also has a bottom line to take care of the family. It has excellent educational significance for men in troubled times or in today's peaceful age.Baunasala 's opening request for help reflects that in the United States in that era, the law and the police did not fully represent justice, and people had to seek the Mafia to provide so-called justice. Even in the face of investigations by federal detectives, the Corleone family did not take them into consideration, because the good relationship between Corleone and politicians made the government not good for them.Corleone has three sons, a daughter, son-in-law, and an adopted son. The eldest son Sonny is a typical son-in-law, and he doesn't understand politics and power. Because of his unfriendly attitude towards his sister-in-law, Carlo leads to collusion with the killing of outsiders. The second son, Fredo, was cowardly and became a playboy because of his involvement in the family's casino business in Las Vegas, but he was still timid. The daughter-in-law had not been planned into the family business, but Carloine killed Sonny and was also killed by his younger son Mike. Mike is Corleone's favorite son. Through Mike's composure to deal with the murder of his father in the hospital, the courage to enter the Tiger's Cave, and the later performance of taking over the family business, it should be most like Corleone. Corleone should be the earliest to see Mike's potential And he loves him the most, but Corleone did not want Mike to be involved in the family business. Because of the conflict with the drug lord Sorozo's business, there were too many accidents, and Mike had to take over the family business. Adopted son Tom is also a good player in politics, calm and calm in the event, and is loyal to the business of the Corleone family. The arrangement of \"being out\" after Mike took over the family business is estimated to let Carlo show the original shape.After his gunshot wounds improved, even after his son Sonny was killed, Corleone did not concentrate on revenge and did not have full emotional affection. Instead, in exchange for a solution to the conflict, he promised to escort the drug business. This is really not easy. It is not what ordinary politicians can do.Mike takes good care of his beloved woman, and although he will also find another couple, he will never get rid of flowers. Sometimes she used good faith lies in exchange for her wife 's trust, so that she would not fall into the fear of gangsters.Movies and books are called men's bibles, and there are indeed many places that I should study and learn from. However, after all, it is still the Western \"Bible\". Our ancestors also have a lot to teach us, which is more worthy of all of us to understand and learn.", "Light and darkness": "Besides being one of the first films to sympathize with the bad guys, \"The Godfather\" is not particularly mind-blowing or innovative. However, it's hands down one of the finest examples of a tastefully produced Hollywood blockbuster, one of those films that manage to meet the needs of all kinds of viewers.I expected the whole movie to be centered on Vito Corleone, and was surprised to find Michael as the real protagonist. I didn't like him at first, but his captivating transformation from an honest war hero into a cold-blooded mafia boss makes is what made this film so captivating.The production and cinematography are top-level: Coppola's subtle camerawork and the cast performances allow us to be naturally sucked in and get lost in the narration despite the demanding running time. The exotic atmosphere of post-war American Mafia is carefully recreated with an elegant touch, with unusually dark shots and shadows on the characters' faces to represent their duality. It's impossible not to notice how the shadows are taking on Michael's face as he gets more and more involved in the family business.The ending has been praised as one of the most intense ever, but I actually thought it was a bit underwhelming. The way the executions are put in contrast with the baptism of Connie's child definitely has its impact, but I thought Michael had it a bit too easy there, especially if we think about how slow the buildup to Sollozzo's murder was. His marriage in Sicily felt a bit rushed as well, even though it served as one more way to show how different Michael is compared to the man of honor and family values that his father used to be.", "Good, but not THAT good": "This is a good movie but not as great as everyone seems to think.Certaintly not the number one movie in the top 250. Heat, in fact,was much better than The Godfather. Pachino's acting was not sovery good and the plot was slightly sluggish. The whole timewhere Pachino is 'away' is a blind alley of a plot line and onlyserves to kill off his first wife that has no bearing on the plot really.7/10", "Cinema from which it is impossible to refuse.": "The Godfather. Cinema from which it is impossible to refuse. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo have created a truly iconic gangster movie! The Godfather is a story about how a person changes his views and becomes what he might have been destined to be. I would especially like to cancel the excellent cast and especially Marlon Brando, who played the boss of the criminal clan Corleone stern and at the same time smart, intelligent and able to think ahead.", "The best Gangster film EVER": "I know everybody says the same thing but this truly is a masterpiece. There are so many truths in the film to real gansterism. like the raspy voice of don Vito is like that of Frank Costello's voice. The wedding at the start of the film is like the Bill Bonanno wedding and even the plot to kill the heads of the five main families at the end of thefilm is taken from Joe Bonanno so i think Mario Puzo knew a lot more about the mob than maybe we all first thought. But still an outstanding piece of film and the book is superb as well.", "One if the best film ever.": "I'n not the great critic, I'm just a person, who loves cinema. If you are like me, you must watch this film. All features in it are on their place. Firstly, the story is based on Mario Puso's book, I really recommend to read it, and this film used almost all book, expect the storyline about young Vito (director used it in sequel). Secondly, all actors did the amazing performance: Brando, Al Pachino, Duvall and others created great film. Thirdly, music and costumes made the atmosphere of late 40s.\nSo, it's really one of the greatest film ever.\nSo,", "They don't make films like these anymore.": "I'll be honest, when I watched this film as a 16 year old I had given it a 5 on IMDb. Back then I found it long, slow and boring and wondered why it had such high ratings. What can I say? I was really dumb and stupid at that time. Now at 22, I feel so ashamed for my thoughts about this film in the past. This is a fricking Perfect film. Release in1972, I can only imagine what waves it must have created around the world back then. The characters, their development, the story, acting and everything are solid! Yes it is long and may feel slow paced, but I don't know how 3 hours passed by. An absolute Masterpiece!", "I don't understand...": "What I don't understand is why so many think this is such a great film. The actors did great, but the whole story to me was boring. I like to see the bad guys get whats coming to them. I think a lot of the guys who watch this kind of idolize them and that's just sad to me. At least it seems that way. Maybe I just like my crime movies to have a more definitive hero. Someone I can root for to come out on top. There are mob/crime family movies I really like so I know its not just the genre I don't care for. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 10 is because the actors were good, otherwise I'd have given it a 1. This is just my opinion of course. I often disagree with critics and ratings so you should watch it and judge for yourself.", "The one film I would bring to a desert island": "A unparalleled statement in cinema on almost all fronts.\"The Godfather\" (1972) is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and co-written with and based on the novel by Mario Puzo. It tells the tale of The Godfather, alias Don Corleone, and originally born Vito Andolini, he is the leader of the Corleone mafia family. As an ageing patriarch, Don Corleone wants his youngest son Michael to take over the family affairs, but he seems uninterested. From then on, the film centres on the increasing tensions between the Corleone and its rival mafia families in the search for power, integrity and honour.I first saw \"The Godfather\" when I was around 14 or 15 years old, and that was truly when I fell in love with films. As a young boy, I could not attribute it to anything specific, but as I grew older, I realised that its grandeur was to be attributed to the numerous levels that Francis Ford Coppola excels at making the perfect film. From the formidable screenplay, to the precise direction, beautiful integration of the awesomely impressive cast (will there ever again be so much acting talent in one film), the perfect score by Nino Rota, the masterful cinematography by Gordon Willis, and the flawless editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner.To focus on perhaps the film's most impressive element, Brando. His pure artful talent shines through in an ever-immersive performance, where he inspired all of his juniors, including Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. His performance in \"The Godfather\" perfectly exemplifies, why they and so many others of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Martin Sheen, the list goes on) hail Marlon Brando as the greatest in the history of the acting craft. He exemplifies how he was capable at portraying all human emotions with such depth and range, and he contributes to making this perfect film shining even more.The very definition of a seminal work and a masterpiece in cinema!", "Greatest film ever": "I finally understand why this film is said to be one of the greatest or the greatest film, it's writing is just top notch and really keeps u hooked the entire time. The godfather deserves to be in imdbs top ten. What I'm sad about is that we will never get a movie this well written ever again, cuz writers today don't want to think wen they write, they just rehash and remake. I really wish we could just switch the writers of this time and the amazing writers from back then with amazing originality, making films that made ppl think instead of spoon feeding them. A masterpiece, 10 out of 10, I will never forget this movie it's just that goof", "The Transformation": "The movie starts with a wedding ceremony where the father of the bride is the boss of an organized crime syndicate. His elder son takes the whole control of his place when he was attacked to near death. The situation forced the younger son to take the whole control while he was not interested in his family business. Thus, the movie deals with how the youngest son transforms from a good guy to a ruthless mafia kingpin.Umm, I don't have to tell more about this movie, as thousands of people in the world who are great in movie reviewing, are already reviewed it. So, nothing new to tell more.The thing is, this movie is considered an all-time masterpiece in history. I would like to focus which I liked in this movie.Marlon Brando, is the aging father, The Godfather in this movie. Whose performance is one of the things which made this movie great.Al Pacino, is the youngest son, also did great performance which nominates him the Best Supporting Actor Academic Award. But he refused to attend it as he thought he deserved a nomination for Best Actor category. Since this movie centered him. And also he had the most screen time. Whereas, Marlon Brando got the Best Actor award for his almost brief role. I think, it is justified, as the first impression is the last impression. Marlon Brando is the first impression of this movie. He is the life of this movie and Al Pacino is one of the parts of the body. But in fact, Al Pacino is the hero of this movie.I liked the music, which was also nominated for the Best Score award but cancelled its nomination at the last moment when it was discovered that the score was originally used in another movie first, which is Charlie Chaplin's Limelight.The director of this movie is Francis Ford Coppola. I wonder, how he directs the movie? He was just 32-33 year old when the movie was made. A 31-32 year old young man directs this masterpiece movie. And finished it in 62 days of shooting. This is amazing. Being a 33 year one now, I really wonder how he directs the movie in this small age? Such a matured movie. Though, it was first offered to director, one of my favorite directors, the director of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, Sergio Leone. Later he regrets his decision.This movie is the finest example of an ideal writing and editing. Without these, this movie is nothing, despite having good casts and direction.I enjoyed the movie a lot. I believe almost everyone will enjoy it. Despite a long movie, long 3 hours.Don't watch it with the family.Recommended 95%.", "Looks good, has good acting... but number 1? Pfft.": "Number one movie of all time?  Come on there isn't much goingon here.  It's strictly a movie for fans of \"actors\" and \"great casts,\"as evidenced by the many user reviews that fail to find anythingelse to say about it.The story's long and dull, unless you happen to be obsessed withmafioso and the little details of Italain Americana of the period,which I must admit it captures well.  But there isn't really any soulor mystery to this movie.  It doesn't really even try to grapple withany issues.  (See Casablanca, or even Empire Strikes Back, andyou'll know what I mean.  You wanna see Brando acting?  \"On theWaterfront.\" Now that's a movie with heart!)I think the real reason it stays ranked so high is that even peoplethat don't like it very much (like me) can't give it much lower than a7 or 8, because it is so strong in its acting, cinematography, andmise en scene.  Whereas the (few) people who don't getCasablanca find it so antique and alien that they feel free to vote itdown with 1s and 2s.  A real shame, that I think even Coppolawould admit.Oh, I'd even recommend Apocalypse Now over Godfather.  There'sjust so much more mystery and human story going on. Godfather's just about some violent stereotypes rehashed with a\"redeeming\" sense of \"Family Honor.\"", "The Greatest Gangster Film": "Easily the best gangster movie I've ever seen. Basically, a young son's rise to power (or descent into evil, depending on the POV) as the leader of a mob family. It's hard to critique a movie like this, which is so highly regarded across the board. All the things you would expect to be phenomenal are; the score, the camerawork, the dialogue, the acting, the scenery, the plot, the pacing. Even though all these people in this movie are evil, murderous men, I still root for them as a viewer. And for some reason, this movie still isn't a 10/10 for me. I think it's something to do with the pacing; aside from Michael, Tom Hagen, and maybe Vito, it doesn't feel like we spend enough time with any characters. They're all so good that I want more of them on screen, but there are a lot of them, and it's a sprawling epic with a limited amount of time. That's a nitpicky critique (this is a fantastic film), but it's my only one.", "Alltime classic": "One of the best Mafia movies ever made; great actors and characters, costly production, awesome plot.\nI agree that Brando's portrait of Don Corleone sometimes appears slightly comical but you also have to see that his character is getting old and weak, hence the raspingly low volume voice and he isn't a purely bad Don and very sincere with his family (especially own blood) members and I think Brando was the right man to portrait these kinds of character traits. Also, every time I saw myself thinking it's comical, I also got bad thoughts like 'You can't think like this of the Don', hence this shows, it is a good performance if he makes me scared as a viewer having these kind of thoughts.\nThere are quite a few people in this movie who only get introduced to the audience on the surface, but play a bigger role towards the end but me as a viewer, I don't feel any bonding to them since I only saw them for 5 minutes before. I think they should've gave them more screen time, so the viewer remembers them better.\nOverall, this is a milestone in the history of movie, you have to watch it at one point. Some scenes - You won't forget. 9/10", "Gangster #1": "Being a bit of a novice when it comes to gangster movies I watched the Godfather for the first time in over 35 years, I recall the lovely scene with the use of \"speak softly love\" when Michael is in hiding in Sicily, but apart from that very little. What a wonderful film, love the sense of family and loyalty that is present throughout. Al Pacino is breathtaking and carries an underlying sense of menace, it is his film. Brando may get the top billing but his role his merely a cameo to Pacino. The clinical dispatch of the families is a wonder to see and a lovely climax to the movie.\nApart from the careless continuity flaws. Michael Corleone's ever changing bruised cheek being the main one. This film is a masterpiece.", "If saw this, and thought that isn't good, see it again, cause you saw wrong.": "The first time I had seen \"The Goofather\" I thought that was just \"ok\" and \"good\", I think that my main issue was that the movie was \"too long\". Well, I passed the last 5 years thinking: \"Man, we saw that movie in the wrong way, this isn't possible\". And, yes, I was wrong, and yes, I had seen it wrong.The thing here is, I saw the movie a couple of days now, and I can't thing in a bad thing about it. Really, that isn't one think that seems misplaced or something. The script is fantastic, the movie had a lot time jumps, but you don't get confused, the actors are great (Marlon Brando and Al Pacino mainly), the photography is beautiful, and a lot other things.

Maybe like yourself I was not totally sweeped in by just the high review and I always had a feeling it might just be dissappointing. Like I never got into some other mega hyped movies.BUT this movie is genuinely a gem. Everything is done so exceptionally well.Literally just finished watching it and it much better then de Goodfellas which is already a good movie.Going to stop writing this review so I can starting watching PT2.", "Overrated..": "I have never been able to watch this movie to the end, tried to watch it couple of times and fell asleep everytime. I think this film is just too long and boring. I can't understand how can someone think it's the best movie ever.", "G. O. A. T Godfather!": "I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience.MASTERPIECE!", "One Of The Greatest Movies Ever": "the godfather is a timeless classic most ages can appreciate. the godfather is one of very few movies that have standed the test of time. the godfather is the best of the trilogy but the godfather pt II is very close but not just  the main reason for this is because Marlon Brando isn't in the second part  he is truely amazing in the godfather if he hadn't of won best actor oscar for it there would be alot of questions to ask.  this was Al Pacinos third movie the previous two not getting him any recognition he changed all this by giving the performance of his life, and if you think hes good in this see part II and even though most reviewers say that  part III is terrible i assure you it is not!  true it is not as good as the previous 2 but Al Pacino should be enough of a reason to watch part III  as he is, as always, amazing. so if you have seen the first Godfather but not the others then just buy the Godfather trilogy on d.v.d  thats what i did.", "Good for its time": "I didn't grow up then but in the modern era having now watched this film it's no 10. The acting is overdone and the multiple characters dropping like flies makes it hard to keep up.", "Good ideas from the novel presented in an average way": "Another oddity in my collection, it is an overrated piece similar to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Schindler's List' although much more watchable I have to say. In the end there are too many ridiculous scenes and poor acting that undersells the overall arching plot.Some strange things I have to ask within the first hour. Why does Don Corleone buy fruit in some craphole edge of the road stall? Why two oranges and a pepper? When the hitmen run towards him he does nothing to defend himself, yet he knows they are gunning for him. They shoot over 6 rounds into him and he, as an old man, survives and is placed into intrusive care?What the hell writing is this? Or perhaps this is more a failing in direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Michael Corleone finds out his father was shot by walking around the street and finding a newspaper with something on it? What? Not a phone call or something that makes sense?This is then followed by Sonny Corleone getting a phone call of the shooting. Why not Michael? What is going on there? Then Sonny writes a note with a pen on the kitchen cabinet door? What the hell? Not a piece of paper or just remember the facts, but he writes on the cabinet door?This is awful. The script is nonsensical and the attention to irrelevant details is what boggles my mind. I think simple minded people think that is fascinating or something but it doesn't hold up the suspension of disbelief for me.What I like from this film is the slow pace and burn. The conflict from the family turf war is gritty and well done. I love that David Chase, like many, took some inspiration from this movie and put a lot of details into 'The Sopranos'. But this movie itself is above average, well made, but full of plot holes and useless tat that could have been cut down to a tight film. The movie 'Goodfellas' has served more inspiration to filmmakers and popular culture than this title did.Scenes such as the \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\" one aren't as great as people claim. In this film it is just an afterthought that was captured on film. Nothing special in the way scenes like that were shot or presented, just bog average really.The best part of this film is the transformation of Michael Corleone, it is good writing. But of course that came from the book, didn't it. This starts to get interesting at just before the hour mark. The murder scene is good but something is off about it. The wine cork pop is a joke, surely? The hit itself was well done, and showed at least how a hit should be done. But the bit of fanfare music is over the top and then a strange piano solo music to accompany the scenes thereafter? They use the garbage spinning newspaper montage like 'Citizen Kane' did, and it is lazy in my opinion.Then plot then send Micahel off to Italy, which is ridiculous. The about turn in tone is off putting and thereafter I always lose interest. Somehow he gets married to an Italian girl and then becomes boss so suddenly. This is bad writing and happens too fast. Don Corleone in Italy running around with a small child in the tomatoes was ridiculous and over the top; stomping through the tomatoes like Goddzilla, then dies.The end 30 minutes with Michael running things is again, over the top and ridiculous. He spent his whole life in school and the military, he knows jack diddly about the family and now they show him running everything on his own.Whatever people say is great about this film, I question with more thought. It is not awful but it is certainly not a masterpiece. For gangster movies I prefer 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', and of course 'The Sopranos' is the best written title ever created.7/10 a good movie though nonsensical at times with above average filming.", "My Heart!!!": "This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on.", "No Words Can Describe How Good This Movie Is (Except for \"Flat-Out Amazing\")": "When I first went into this movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Sure, it often was on the top of lists of the Greatest Films Ever Made, but that was likely to create nearly-impossible hype. (Which had previously caused disappointment upon my first viewing of \"Citizen Kane\") I had previously found the movie in an article called \"Movies You Hate the First Time but Love the Second.\" And it was also three hours long, so it would definitely have its slow scenes. (I was only able to make through the first 90 minutes of \"Lawrence of Arabia\") Cautiously, I turned the movie on. And within minutes, all my doubts disappeared.For those of you who haven't seen it, \"The Godfather\" is the story of Michael Corleone, the son of Vito Corleone, a powerful Mafia boss. He initially tries to distance himself from the family business as much as possible, but he slowly gets drawn in, until his father passes control of the family down to him. So what is it about this movie that makes it such a classic? (\"Everything\" would be too obvious and brief, so I'll try to go into more detail.)The best part of this movie is, of course, the acting. Marlon Brando is fantastic as Don Vito, so obviously he really deserved his win of the Best Actor Oscar. (Although he infamously refused the award as a protest against Native Americans' portrayals in film) He really sells the fact that he is a powerful man, but also isn't as bad as one would think, and just cares about the family. Al Pacino as Michael is excellent in all his subtlety, as he goes through his transformation from a really nice guy into the ruthless head of the family. (Although from what I've heard, he goes even further in Part II, which I have yet to see) Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's girlfriend really manages to stand out in her supporting role despite being surrounded by amazing screen legends in the main roles. James Caan as Sonny is fantastic, Robert Duvall as Tom is great, Richard S. Castellano as Clemenza is just as good, I could go on forever, but I need to finish this up.Another great part of the movie is the script, (Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo) which wisely knows to focus on and develop the characters, which are very well aided by the fine performances of the cast. The film lets us spend a lot of time with these characters until we feel we know them as well as our own family. (Okay, not QUITE that far, but you get the idea) The way the script handles these characters is brilliant: Despite the fact that they are in the Mafia, they are not necessarily evil. The movie spends a lot of time with them, and they seem like really nice people. (Well, except for the other families) And whenever the characters tell a story, because of how interesting the script makes the characters and their stories, all you have in your head is that story, and it even feels like its own movie.The film has a really memorable score by Nino Rota; it doesn't have to be big or bombastic, it doesn't need to have a bunch of choir members singing frantically, it is more relaxed and melancholy. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is really beautiful, with plenty of shades of orange that perfectly complement the violence and gore of the different murders throughout the film. (Which aren't terribly brutal, but definitely for ages 14 and up) And the film is pretty well edited as well: Despite its long length, it rarely feels like it is three hours long, and when it occasionally slows down, those moments are really far between, and fairly brief. The only real complaint I have about the movie is that some things happen that I felt could have been explained a little more, but that's just me nitpicking.So overall, \"The Godfather\" is flat out amazing, I can't compliment this movie enough. Nearly everything about it is perfect, I give it a 10/10.(But seriously, this only won 3 Oscars? Are you kidding me?)", "Finally after 48 years !": "I finally watch it after 48 years ! What an excellent movie , performance wise each and every character shine in their own way , the twist and turns were amazing !", "The Greatest Movie I have ever seen": "The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever.", "Nothing Compares": "A 1972 thriller encapsulating the slow destruction of a valuable family. The crime film, based on Mario Puzo's best selling 1969 novel of the same name - saw Puzo also co-write the screenplay alongside Coppola. Despite many debates over casting, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino portrayed their roles with excellence, not to mention James Caan and the evergreen Diane Keaton. A big hit in its day, the movie was the highest grossing in 1972, between $246 and $287, worth the $80,000 paramount paid to have license to Puzo's book. Spanning from 1945 to 1955, the film endures suffering, passion, tension and love, exploring the ruthless and dark profession in the mafia. In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone listens to requests in his role as don of the Corleone crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion, showing that the Corleone's mean business. Brando's character is presented as conservative, worshipped and extremely authoritative, his work is his priority and his peculiar yet sinister speech reinforces his power. Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozo backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garrotted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone's first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men. Michael (Al Pacino) having just returned from the war, initially wants little or no involvement in the Corleone's business, yet is almost manipulated into performing such a consequential crime. His characterisation is relaxed and the individual is often happy to take a back seat, but, as he is embroiled further in the family business, he creates unprecedented distance between himself and Kay. Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life. We as viewers slowly see the descending reputation of the Corleone family - with Michael forced to keep a low profile, many attempted murders on Vito and the brutal death of Sonny. Devastated by Sonny's death and realising that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family. We see a transition in Michael's overall attitude, far more assertive and much less reluctant. His loyalties are now firm with the Corleone family, contrasting to his commitments returning from his work as a marine. The protagonist shows no signs of grief following the death of his short-term lover Apollonia, seeing it instead as an excuse to leave Sicily and take full control back in New York. In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrottes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her. In all its beauty, we are privileged to visualise such a spectacle. As one 'Godfather' falls, another rises. Once Michael was in the business, he couldn't bring himself to leave, Al Pacino convincingly creates the innocence of the character from the outside, contrasting to his cunning nature inside. The cinematography is well-ahead of its times, most notably in the wedding scene. In the peculiar cyclical structure, the film began at Connie and Carlo's wedding with Vito as the head don. Since then the family quite literally crumbled; Carlo's abuse towards Connie fuelled anger inside of Sonny, who was brutally murdered on his way to protect her. Fredo Corleone preferred life away from the family, Michael initially disregarded the occupation, but, he was tempted by the power and authority that accommodates. His role as 'head' in the family saw his relationship with Kay deteriorate, something that he wasn't aware he was doing. Grabbing a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Possessing an ultimate calmness and collectedness, Brando portrays Vito's commanding jurisdictions and intimidation's. Most impressively, the American actor perfects the distinctive, soft-spoken tone of voice, reinforcing the brilliance of 'The Godfather'.", "It's Fine": "Finish watching it today, I expect too much because of the reviews they say that this is the best and greatest movie ever but when i watch it it's good and watchable maybe it's just not my type of movie.\nBut still It's fine to me, not too bad and not too good, the action and killings is brutal.\nFOR ME not the best movie but not the worst.", "A man.": "Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.", "The Epic Trilogy": "In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse\" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a \"real life\" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie. There is no evidence of this custom being mentioned prior to the movie.", "It's great and all that but...": "This is a legendary film and I don't think I have to sing it's praises. However...From my experience, two things that nobody seems to have an issue with is the scene where Caan beats the crap out of his sister's abuser. It looked terrible. He clearly hit the air. It was embarrassing. And the scene where Brando is shot in the back about ten times. HE SHOULD BE DEAD!!!! And how lucky for him that they didn't shoot him in the head, considering all Italian hitmen do that! Maybe it's a matter of not caring because of how good everything else is, but for me personally, these things are incredibly distracting, especially when something could've been fixed so easily, i.e. the beating.", "My favourite": "This is awesome movie I enjoyed watching\nAnd it's the best movie ever\nGreat job", "The weight of the inheritance.": "I could find several parts what the mafia philosophy and the manly sentiments are.\nThe words become like a wet blanket in the face of these great images. I always felt what a romantic life of the man is every time I touch in such great masculinity.Although the Corleone family is a criminal organization, they have their own rules and behave themselves coherently. This is the reason I feel they are awesome.\nThey act cool-headed, but I feel the charity and the warmth of humanity at the same time. The man with the coherence is absolutely cool.The god father's back told us their philosophy and the manly sentiments were. Michael was gradually piling himself on his father's back.\nThe dignity of mafia should reflect to 'the brand image.'I got a goosebumps with the change in Michael's appearance he got more and more distinctive as Don Corleone. When I saw the beggining of the movie again, I was so surprised! Who was he? So I'm thrilled to think each of his just action.", "A Story about Family and Murder": "The Godfather is a masterpiece that is almost so beloved that people have forgotten why. This movie has some of the best written dialogue ever put to screen. This movie is also unmatched in its acting, still being one of the greatest casts ever. On top of all of this there is a great story of someone becoming a family man even though that goes against what he previously thought moral. Micheal Corleone has one of the biggest character arcs of any character ever, he is a totally different man by the end of this movie. The Godfather is a timeless movie and inspired a generation of film.", "Honestly, I think the 1st one is just good!": "Im not a huge fan of mafia movies and especially the ones that last 3 hours and more. I will admit that for its time 1972, The first installment of Godfather is fine with a good performance from Corleones. Took me a while to recognise Al Pacino there ... I liked the light part with the wedding and then the exact opposite that will provoke whats coming next. Nice directing with some realistic mafia thinking. I believe though that the next two might be better. It would be better if it lasted 2 20 minutes.", "Very Little To Offer": "Here's how the arguments go for liking this movie go: The Godfather is a great movie because it's a hallmark of the genre. While gangster movies before this had been wall-to-wall violence and only loosely strung together by a plot, The Godfather was able to move away from that tradition by having a plot-heavy mobster movie. The performances were all superb and the characters all felt real.However, what this argument fails to recognize is that the plot moves at such a slow pace that it's difficult to give a damn about it. This is quite honestly the slowest paced movie I've ever seen, and it would have been improved a thousand-fold if an hour or so had been cut. It's not that I hate slow movies--a slow pacing can work brilliantly--but The Godfather? No, it doesn't do it.As for the cast and performances, they're really not all they're cracked up to be. If indecipherable mumbling is your thing, so be it, and in that case, this movie is the best thing ever. In reality, though, half-mumbled lines don't really do anything for me, and because of that; all the characters seemed to be fairly one-dimensional as a result.I can see how you could like this movie. On a technical level, it did move away from the traditional three-point lighting which was common in earlier films, and the plot was definitely something other than what had been dealt with in mobster movies before then. But the content of the plot was somewhat devoid of any real interest--or at least it was for me--and the characters came off as being one-dimensional as a result.", "Hmm... nevermind the headline": "I love The Godfather. Sitting here with my overexpensive, 4K box, which tells me in big letters that this is the 50th anniversary for the greatest movie ever made, make me feel old. It was made the year before I was born, and I first saw it in... 1982, 9 years old, with my dad. I didn't get much of the story, but got hypnotized by the awesome beginning with Brando's speech and the wedding. My lifelong obsession as a film geek was truly lit. There's something really special about it, that other movies lacks. Some critics says it glamorishes the mafia. Don't agree at all. It's a movie about family, and in glimpses we see the power and violence Vito Corleone possesses. And if anyone thinks it glamorises the mob, they are beyond stupid. It anything, the trilogy tells about the corruption of the human soul, when Michael Corleone goes full in to be the next Don, with some incredible violent scenes edited into the bapthism of Michael's own godson. He sold his soul, but he doesnt care. It's beautiful told, because Coppolla happens to be a great director, with incredible actors around. Seems I'm in minority thinking the 1st is the best. Mostly because it's \"my precious favorite\", but Part II has a bit to much politics that doesnt involve The Corleone's directly, so I will always find it \"inferiour\". It's a great, great movie, none the less. Now I'm looking forward to finally see the revised The Godfather Part III in full 4K.

It was only over time when I was reminded by it, such as the visual look of Don Vito Corleone, or the iconic quotes such as \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\", that I began to realise that I had witnessed a masterpiece. The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in history, that has truly influenced our society. There's good story telling, distinct memorable characters, and a very good ending.

I believe strongly that, this movie has a special place for everyone.

I mean this is not the film that completely fit the life. The all characters of the movie are extraordinary. And therefore it is very hard to create these heroes behind the camera. That is why Marlon Brando (Don Vito Corleone), Al Pacino(Michael Corleone) or James Caan (Santino 'Sonny' Corleone) made their life job.

He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending.

The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars.", "No Where Near The Master Piece As Shown": "I like to say that this movie was so fine that the violence and sexual references spoiled it all and the message was so deep. The Godfather is by far one of those movies that adults say even 16 year old kids like me can't watch it because it's very hard for even them to watch. It was rated R originally but they changed it to MA probably they think it's too offensive for viewers to say it's a masterpiece and doesn't deserve to be so highly rated. The Shawshank Redemption in the other hand was a perfect movie with the deepest message known as hope and was surprisingly rated MA in Australia and on the TV rating is Rated M which is more fair enough. The Godfather was just horrible and I really thought that Part 2 would be better but it really isn't and for once in my life I'm going to confirm that The Godfather shouldn't deserve to be known as a masterpiece", "Acting Masterclass": "The Lebron of movies, (2nd only to MJ - Godfather Part II) the original Godfather still holds up, excelling in every area of film making. The support cast is A grade across the board, particularly Duvall and Caan. Brando created an icon, while Coppolla managed to assemble all the pieces to create a masterpiece. But it is Pacino who delivers the performance of a lifetime, only to better it two years later. The Sollozzo scene in the restaurant is an acting masterclass. 10/10.", "beyond": "I find this movie compelling and though crime is present in it, you can feel it is not an obscene ... scene. because it is art. i lked Duvall and Brando more. I like it lets us be smart and ,,see,, the traitors. the senes from Italy are amazing.", "A classic that drags its heals": "There is no doubt what so ever that the godfather is a classic film. Hell, some even say its the best film ever made. I on the other hand, think its a great film with some flaws.Being at the tender age of 23, i watched the godfather in its entirety for the first time today. Having seen the complete film, but only in segments, watching it from beginning to end, i found myself enjoying this classic film, but often getting board at the same time.The problem with the film, (if you could call it a problem) is that, its mostly talk. Sure, there's the ocasional gun play, or graphic scene (the horse head is classic) but, compared to scarface, goodfellas, and even the sopranos, it lags by comparison. People want to have a good story and godfather delivers up an offer you cant refuse (im sorry i had to say it), but, its just dull in spots compared to other gangster classics.Overall i found godfather to be a prime example of storytelling and acting, and it deserves every award and honor its receved, but in my book, it fails to over throw the don of gansta films, Scarface (1983)", "reality": "Separating the \"Godfather\", each of the small clips is actually bland, but when these bland clips are combined, they produce such a huge magic, the essence, because all this Real emotions are the foundation, without any contrition, without any exaggeration. Just like our real life, people are actually very sensitive to reality.", "Story Or Poem": "In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gunfire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Tom should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, Peter Clemenza, garrotes Carlo with a wire. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.", "A true landmark in cinema!": "This is the one of the greatest and best crafted gangster films I've ever seen in my life.", "Simply ........ The Greatest Picture Ever Made.": "This movie is a great honor for all American cinema. Really It's nice an great I've watched this movie 23 times (until now) and I am planing to watch it more. I would like to thank Marlon Brando and Al pacino for this and of course the great director \"Copola\"", "Wonderful": "I think this is a great movie. The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.", "i hated it": "i hated it. the movie was so long and it was hard to follow. the sequels were OK. i feel that this movie was over rated way too much. so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just don't understand how that is possible. Marlon Brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront, A streetcar named desire, and don Juan Marco just to name a few. Pacino wasn't even that good. i much preferred him in Carlitos way and Donnie bras-co and who could forget Scarface. Pacino is getting typecast. i think the only reason he did Simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal. i have to say i can't blame him. Pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come on", "Legend \u0130n The World": "he Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film \"auteur.\" Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and \"legitimate\" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding \"favor,\" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune,\" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: \"for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.\"Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: \"My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.\"\"Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now.\" \"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.\" And most famously of all: \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, \"Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!\" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). \"Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,\" he relates, \"and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me.\" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as \"Senator Corleone\" or \"Governor Corleone\" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten- year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (\"prince of darkness\") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes \u2013 especially in the Don's home office \u2013 with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that \"crime did not pay.\" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.", "One of the best film ever made": "Godfather is one of the rare films that I watch over and over and every time I enjoy it the same as first time. It is true masterpiece in many ways from directing and acting to mesmerizing quotes and music. To me it has layers that every time I watch I find something new in it. Its interesting approach to the world of women that overshadowed under Muscular games of men mirrored the social issues of 50s in its hidden layers. The color theme in dark brown scenes reminded the Gothic era and architecture works perfectly. Men in dark rooms and covered windows taking care of their mostly illegal business.

The amazing part of this movie is after Marlon Brando's is almost killed and Michael makes the decision to take out Sollozo and and the captain for what tried to do to his father, after that scene Michael is never the same he realizes what he has to become and has to do to take care of his family.

Therefore, he can casually interact with high-level political figures, from the lowest level to the highest level of society, he can also weave a large and intangible net.

This line of \"Sheep in wolf skin\" is the truth conveyed by The Godfather:\"A man who doesn't take time to stay with his family is not a real man.\"\"Women and children can be careless, but men can't.\"\"Don't let outsiders know what you're thinking.\"His playing time is actually not much, but every action and every sentence is the essence. Without him, The Godfather would not become the \"Man's Bible\".How could this great man be \"tragedy\"?He is not personally tragedy, at least he is \"good end\", which is related to the principle he has always adhered to. In his opinion, career should not be an excuse for delaying the family.

The film starts with a wedding sequence of half an hour, all in which we are introduced into the world of the characters, and their respective business. We see Don Vito Corleone ( Marlon Brando ) calmly doubting the sincerity of an undertaker's request, we see Santino Corleone ( James Caan ) breaking a camera of a journalist, we see Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino ) being the one soul that seems to be absent from most of the family at that part, telling us the story of the characters and personalities wonderfully. Due to this extended opening sequence, we also get a feel for the brotherhood and warmth that the mob can also possess. It is, of course, a sad cover for what is to come afterwards, as The Godfather is also somewhat of a study on the self destructive nature of man, as nearly every character in the end pays for price for immorality.The Godfather is one of the best acted films of all-time. Most of this is of course because of Marlon Brando, who is deliberately made up like a 'bulldog' to fit his personality. The mannerisms & voice are somehow exactly what one would think when thinking of the founder of a gigantic mob empire. There is not really a weak spot in the acting throughout the entire picture, but other standouts are James Caan & Robert Duvall. Of course Al Pacino also set himself on the map with this performance as the good hearted war hero transforms into the stoic and calculated don of the family. As stated before, the film is near perfectly structured, with events always coinciding with character ( Take the final scene of Michael in Italy for example, with his wife getting killed in the car bomb. This scene is only there to further disconnect Michael emotionally between his work and his life, further sending him down the dark path to becoming the Don ), being the result of one of the greatest screenplays of all-time.The Godfather features cinematography befitting its subject, as a lot of shots are very scarcely lit. In particular the scenes indoors where the mob business is being discussed, the darkness makes sure that only the faces and the white parts of the outfit are shown, as they are mostly wearing black during these scenes. This was to emphasize how 'shady' the dealings of the mob were, and this darkness enhances this feeling in the audience.The original score by Nino Rota is also one worthy of mention, as it perfectly encapsulates what this movie is about; friendship, family, beauty & tragedy. Being an Italian composer who has previously composed other (Italian) masterpieces such as The Leopard (1963) & Rocco and his Brothers (1960), he also manages to give the Godfather this italian atmosphere, further enhancing the immersion into the roots of this family.In the end, The Godfather is mainly about Michael's slow ascent to the top of the ladder in the family. He doesn't want to have anything to do with the business of the family at first, but he feels compelled to act when assassins try to assassinate his father, feeling that he is the only one who can get close enough to his enemies to eliminate them, and after he has done so, the events he witnesses in italy cause him to develop an even more emotionally disconnected personality that makes him feel compelled to take his family's throne. By the end, there is a sequence which contrasts the baptism of Michael's new nephew with the simultaneous murder of all of his competition ( Other mob bosses ), in a stunning sequence of moral duality. While Bach's satanic score plays, and enhances in sound significantly when Michael is asked if he renounces Satan. One of the masterful scenes in a masterful film, it perfectly shows us his final personal descent into immorality & emotional disconnection.The Godfather is an epic family ballad of themes and tragedies, while also being exceptionally well made. It features some of the best acting & writing of all-time, superbly darkly lit sets to enhance atmosphere and a fantastic original score while being near perfectly structured. All of which cements this as one of the world's greats of mob & rise to power movies.", "Pretty good, not the best of all time!": "The Godfather! Known as the best movie of all time. That's about as high as the bar can be set, I think something like this will always disappoint when the bar is that high. Was it a great movie? Yes. Was it the best movie I've ever seen? No. Thankfully it reminded me that movies cannot actually provide as any sense of true purpose, real meaning, or long lasting satisfaction. They're an escape. This movie helped me to remember that movies alone cannot show me who I really am. It can educate and show new perspectives, and show part of who we are, or we can feel happy for a while, but this never lasts. If the best movie ever made couldn't do it then surely no movie can. I'd held out so long for watching this movie, always seeing it at the top of IMDB lists and imagining how good it must be, when it easily beats some of my all time favourites. But at the end of the day its just another movie. Worth watching. Not worth putting all your hope into of being the pincale of movie making. Great acting, great story though. It felt so authentic, very fresh and unlike movies that are made today.

The Godfather is not only the Don of all Mafia melodrama, but it is also the standard grade of superiority for critics and filmmakers alike.Based on Mario Puzo's bestseller of the same name, the story begins in 1945 at the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire), the daughter of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Even on his daughter's day of celebration, Don Vito still manages to take care of \"business.\" After a few men grace his presence and ask for a few favors \u0096 revenge, a leading role, etc. \u0096 the Don unites with his family for the ceremony. His youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who has recently returned home from war a hero, brings his new love Kay (Diane Keaton), and the Don's two older sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), along with his \"adopted\" son and confidant Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), also come to celebrate their sister's special occasion.With each of the five major mob families straining to gain ground on one another, the budding industry of narcotics presents a forum for a few to achieve a competitive advantage. However, it is Don Vito who declines Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), the drug supplier, of his offer to commence an involvement in narcotics trafficking. His son and heir apparent, Sonny, obviously disagrees with his father's choice \u0096 seeing that drugs are the wave of the future \u0096 but the Godfather does not concede. Don Vito understands that the drug industry is a cutthroat business where friends are few and far between. It is this rejection that spirals the Corleone family down a brutal one-way street that will both cost the five families many lives, and allow a new Don to emerge.Al Pacino plays the supporting role of Michael with fire in his eyes. His transformation, from a civilian to a Godfather in both senses of the term, is the film's main and most dynamic storyline. In almost every sense, Pacino steals the thunder out from under Brando; nonetheless, Brando's role is perhaps the most iconic role in all of cinema. His character, styled after real life mobster Frank Costello, is one of the films many highlights.Despite an unmistakable missed punch, a few continuity issues, and an abundance of character roles to keep straight, The Godfather remains one of the most influential films in cinematic history. Not only will Brando's husky whisper continue to be copied for generations to come, but also the only fruit that shares its name with its color will always signify an impending death or violent incident.Aside from all of the orange metaphors, The Godfather's resounding themes on the duality of man \u0096 love and hate, good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, and family and violence \u0096 allow it to emit an atmosphere like no other film. The Godfather is the utter embodiment of the ultimate \"guy film\", yet whether you are a male or female or a frequent or infrequent moviegoer is not dependent on how much appeal you will hold towards this first-rate pulp crime drama. Regardless of your status, you will be taken aback by its magnificence.On The Internet Movie Database's website, The Godfather is listed as the number one favorite movie of all time, and on The American Film Institute's chart of the \"100 Years\u0085100 Movies,\" it is listed as the number three greatest film. First or third, there is no question why The Godfather holds a spot on a myriad of Top 10 lists, mine included. It is a seminal classic that will only continue to steamroll sovereignty, praise, and admiration.", "Exquisite": "The Godfather is considered by most to be one of the finest films ever made, with good reason. It's unforgettable.It's beautiful. The cinematography is legendary, from the dark hallways of the family home in New York to the bright, sunny skies of Sicily, this movie is a feast for the eyes. And the soundtrack, mostly written by Nino Rota, perfectly accompanies the visuals to complete the atmosphere.It's an acting clinic. There has arguably never been a better cast for a movie. No fewer than four actors - Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall - received acting nominations. It's likely that having three characters nominated for best supporting actor cost Pacino the much deserved Oscar (which went to Joel Gray for Cabaret). Al Pacino has gone on to a celebrated, illustrious career, but he was never better than he was here. But James Caan as Santino and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen were also terrific. And then there was Marlon Brando's performance, which dominates the screen whenever he's on.It's a study in dichotomy. These characters were mobsters, stone cold killers who chilled to the bone. And yet they were devoted to their family and absolutely loyal.It's also a study in character development. We see Michael begin as a man of principle and character who rejects the family business, but at a time of need he joins his family to defend his father's life. From that point we watch him descend, little by little, until at the end he's a monster himself. No other movie shows so artfully a man lose his soul.And apart from all that, it's quite entertaining. I can recommend no other movie more highly.", "I finally saw the whole thing! Great movie!": "It took me a while to get this movie watched from beginning to end, as it seems I would always catch it a half hour or so in. I'd never want to watch a movie that's supposed to be as great as this after missing the first \u00bd hour. Then there were the times I'd catch it on HBO, TMC or Showtime late at night and fall asleep (admit it, it does get off to a slow star). Finally i stole my brother's set of all three Godfather movies and watched front to back. Damn good cast. I liked Marlon Brando a lot and Al Pacino is already one of my favorite actors ('Scarface' I still like better than Godfather). Then you got your James Caan and Robert Duvall was at his best.Cool story about family and gangster life, loved the horse's head.9/10", "Godfather: LET DOWN": "I am a 14 year old film buff and have just set up my account on IMDb if i had set this up earlier i would have commented on this film before now. I watched the Godfather when i got it as a Christmas present 3 years ago, when i watched it i immediately thought wow what a let down!! everyone who i spoke to had said it was one of the best films they had ever seen. But i disagree, there is no denying that the acting and direction in the Godfather is sublime but it is the fact that it is so monotonous, many people will say that it is because i am 14 but i have seen many films including other Coppela films such as The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, which is my favourite film so i definitely am not saying that Coppela cannot direct but what i am saying is that he could have done so much better with the script, the talent and the locations. So overall I am saying this: The Godfather is not a Bad film just very poor and it is definitely not all it is cracked up to be. Thankyou for reading my review.", "BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME": "The Godfather is one of the best movies ever. It has an excellent story with an excellent mafia atmosphere, and since I love the mafia theme, I fell in love with this film. It's unbelievable how well the film is made, and it's a 1972 film. The actor Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone, performed a perfect job, and the godfather himself is definitely worth mentioning. Overall, all the actors did an excellent performance here. There are a lot of legendary scenes. The scene in Italy is one of the best and maybe the best scene of all the movies ever. There is also a soundtrack, which is masterful and it is one of the best soundtracks ever. Also maybe the best ever. The Godfather is MASTERPIECE and it's a MUST-SEE movie.", "It's Marlon Brando for me": "This film hits all the marks without resulting to cheap gore and over the top performances. One really does feel as if they are a part of the Corleone family. Coppola managed to take a concept as dark and dangerous as the mob and humanize it, creating a full-circle story that makes the viewer feel pain, joy, familial bonds, anger, justice and injustice, throughout. Paired with his incredible storytelling are the performances of everyone in the cast; so strong and believable. (Marlon Brando being my favorite) This film should be a part of everyone's repertoire. What more could I say about a film that has been glorified since its creation?", "Greatest film of all time.": "Many who have viewed this film consider it one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever made. The performance by Marlon Brando is legendary and iconic. The plot development and character development by far is heads above any other film that I have have had the pleasure of seeing. What in my opinion stands out above all in this film and perhaps the most understated and unappreciated film performances ever.Al Pacino played what I believe to be the most believable and powerful performance in film history. The complexity of Michael Corleone and his slow and uncontrolled spiral into the dark side of power and influence.Never before have I seen a more complete and developed performance; it is as if you see this idealistic young man forced into a life he rejected, only to become the most ruthless and feared crime figure of all time,all the while maintaining a realism and not going over the top much like the Tony Montana Character Pacino Played in Scarface. Displaying power and intimidation with minimal effort or any threatening physical attributes Pacino is able to let us as the viewers delve deep in to the soul of this tortured young man and see the birth of power hungry perverse monster who carries himself like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was a crime that this stellar performance was not awarded with the academy award. The first two films of this trilogy allows us to see Al Pacino reach the pinnacle of acting, closing out what might be considered the best overall character performance in a film series with a truly under appreciated and powerful performance in the Godfather Part III. Pacino's performance in the Godfather in my opinion is the single best performance in film history, and the Godfather is the greatest American film ever made.", "an offer you can't refuse": "This is, undoubtedly, THE classic movie of all time, and seems to set a standard for lines, effects, acting, action, and all other basic elements connected with any movie. With all due respects to the outstanding and late actor Marlon Brando, it was more than just he who made the movie an outstanding success, though he was convincing as the usually-calm yet almost-always cold, controlling don Vito Corleone The nostalgia effects were superb: it was not the least bit difficult to imagine what NYC was like between 1945 and 1955. (1971 NYC was \"turned into\" the NYC of the time setting of the story.) James Caan was as mean as mean could be in his role as the godfather Vito Corleone's son Santino, (Sonny) and Al Pacino, as the don's youngest and favorite son Michael Corleone, had his career launched in just this movie. Of course, Diane Keaton proved to be a promising future star in her role as Kay Adams at her young age of about twenty-five. The story came across as a story of, in my personal opinion, how NOT to live. (Of course, some would disagree with me one hundred per cent on that.) This in-depth study of the Mafia (though the word \"mafia\", as the case was supposed to be, was never used) was definitely a convincing view of the underworld with, among other things, the \"eye-for-eye\" mindset. To recapitulate, the nostalgia, the action, the acting, and the story itself made it THE great feat for Hollywood for all time. Paramount Studios, the director Francis Ford Coppola, and the producer Albert S. Ruddy should be proud.", "It is Legendary": "It is hard to explain how great a great movie with Great Actors along with excellent story and direction.Godfather belongs to that type of movies which in any generation it is new and will be new and in one world it is forever is best film ever. Francis Ford Coppola successfully could shows mafia world to world in one movie!Godfather was a signature on Marlon Brando's career and an approval signature on Al Pacino's career.I am sure any one enjoys of watching this really great movie. Thank you so much Francis Ford Coppola Thank you... thank you. Any way I give 10/10 stars for this excellent movie so do not hesitate to watch it.", "Story Rhyme": "In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone listens to requests in his role as don of the Corleone crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men.Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.", "Must watch": "Must watch together with all the 3 parts The Godfather series is widely regarded as the greatest films in world cinema and is seen as one of the most influential films of all time, especially in the gangster genre. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering. Some critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's appeal (\"You can act like a man!\", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane)", "Words Are Not Enough": "Cinema lovers all over the world consider this movie as the best movie ever. And to some extent I agree . The plot of the movie has been repeated and copied by so many movies coming after this, that it will be of no use of me explaining it.The characters of this movie have become legends especially of Don Vito Corleone played by the great Marlon Brando. Many other actors in different movie industries tried to emulate this character in their own way but failed to create an impact as huge as Brando created. But the character who keeps his own amongst the geniusness around is Michael Corleone which gave a first glimpse of the acting prowess of one of the greatest actors of this generation Al Pacino . Another actor who impressed is the great Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) who played the supporting part to perfection. The movie is almost 3 hours long but nowhere the movie loses its grip on the audience .Coppola has made sure that the audiences are craving for what is going to be the next twist in the movie .The best scene in the movie according to me is the Baptism and the enemy killings scene which showcased the great capabilities of the director. \"I will make him an offer he can't refuse\" can be called as one of the best dialogues of the cinema history. This is one movie any cinema lover cannot afford to missRating : 9/10", "A must see...": "This is perhaps my favorite film of all time. No other picture of its kind is even comparable. It's such a great film that I almost find it difficult to write about. From the cast to the cinematography to the music, this movie leaves you absolutely mesmerized throughout.The Godfather is not just another \"Mob\" picture, it is a portrayal of family, life, love & loss. It has just the right elements to captivate any audience. I was probably 12 or 13 years old the first time I viewed this film, and I never grow tired of watching it. The cast really, really made this picture. This movie has perhaps the best cast of characters and acting of any film ever made.I would love to review each character individually, but I can't. The entire cast no matter how large or small the part, is amazing. This movie is both a classic, and has aged well in the process. I would recommend this film to everyone, no matter what your movie genera preference is.", "joining the underworld": "The Godfather is a great film made with gusto. Most of the participants are at their career best. Nina Rota's magnificent score and Francis Ford Coppola's direction tie things together very well. Al Pacino is the greatest performer of a top-shelf cast. The decision to cast him as Michael is a stroke of cinematic genius. (Supposedly, Marlon Brando threatened to quit if Pacino wasn't cast, and this tipped the scales in Pacino's favor.)Another diminutive actor playing Michael might have emulated James Cagney a bit, with bounce and swagger in his step. Pacino never seems worried about his physical stature; instead, his Michael is very articulate. Pacino and Brando are putting on a Method acting show; and their chemistry together is sublime.The Godfather foreshadows Michael's destiny exquisitely. For example, consider the hospital sequence. Michael enters a room looking for the detectives protecting his father and we hear the musical soundtrack repeating the number \"two.\" Michael opens the hospital door to his father's room--and it is clearly marked with the number two. The association of the number two with Vito when Michael is present foreshadows the rise of Michael in the family business. (That is, Michael is #1.) In addition, the actor playing Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei) has a strong resemblance to Pacino. When Michael throws Enzo's carnations away (on the steps outside the hospital) this is another clue that Michael is destined to chuck away the lover boy side of him and rise in the underworld.Marlon Brando's performance is a lightning rod for criticism, praise and satire. It is difficult to imagine any other actor of his time portraying Don Vito with all the knowing looks and gestures that Brando makes. It is another brave portrayal from Brando.The conflict between brothers Sonny (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is well explored. Sonny is all testosterone and action while Tom Hagen is cautious and inexperienced in underworld affairs. Since Hagen is adopted, he is both an insider and an outsider. The audience needs him to help understand the Sicilian logic at play.Having seen The Godfather dozens of times, it is fun pointing out the implausibility with the story. For example, it seems very hard to believe that a brother-in-law, already having been savagely smacked around in public for hitting his wife, would beat her again knowing that his wife's hot-headed brother would chase after him without his bodyguards. How much could Carlo have been paid to willingly absorb the risk that his brother-in-law exercises usual caution?Another implausible is that Barzini is doing something in public the day of the Baptism. Forgetting that Baptisms usually occur on a Sunday, what happens to Michael if Barzini is staying at home that day?The Godfather has us rooting for Michael even as he descends into evil. The transformation that Michael makes is shared by the viewer; we are also joining a criminal conspiracy. It is a uniquely memorable and pleasurable ride.", "One of the three best movies ever made": "The Godfather is one of the two or three best movies ever made, A skillfully crafted movie that looks into the heart of a mob family. Micheal is a war hero wanting to stay out of the family business untill his father is shot, After that all bets are off, Al Pacino gives a calm yet chilling preformance as Mike. Well written the movie zips along with no dull parts. 10 out of 10", "Vastly Over-rated": "The Godfather is an engaging and compelling story to say the least, but as a movie- so what?  Just because something makes for a great story or play doesn't mean it can automatically translate onto the big screen.  There has to be some point of making it into a movie, and quite frankly, The Godfather works just as effectively as a book.  The characters, the dialogue, the plot twists- yeah, they're all okay, but where are the shots, the angles, the editing techniques, the sound effects that make this into a number one film???  The conventions of film are all used pretty simply according to the Hollywood format- ie, make the camera invisible.  There are few scenes anywhere in The Godfather Trilogy that stand out in the history of cinema. If you want an entertaining movie, you will certainly like the Godfather. But you may just as well read the book (unless, like so many today, you haven't the time).  But if you want a film that stretches the genre or that will blow you away with an element OTHER than storyline and dialogue, you can do a lot better.", "After the success of a new Top Gun movie and a new American Gigolo show, Paramount should think of a new Godfather movie or show!": "Is it even possible to still contribute something to the many glorious reviews that are already available?! I just do not know... This movie is perfect in so many aspects that it is ridiculous to say anything other than what everyone is already saying.But wait... Maybe I can still contribute something! I personally loved the amazing performance of Marlon Brando in the role of Vito Corleone, a godfather in his 70's or 80's. To even realize that Marlon Brando was as old as I currently am, just makes me appreciate what a difficult task he was faced with.The cool thing that I learnt is that the dentist of Marlon Brando even had a special mouthpiece made that brought his chin forward. Together with the very recognizable voice of Vito Corleone, it is this combination that contributes to making this movie iconic. Who hasn't ever tried to mimic the voice of the godfather?!This 50-year old movie still stands at the top of the list of \"best movies ever made\". And rightfully so! I have watched this movie already several times in my life, and each time I enjoyed watching it.And of course it isn't too surprising that I give this movie a 10-star rating. Anything less than a perfect score would be an insult!It is remarkable that after 50 years - I write this in 2022 - Paramount still hasn't decided to make other movies that fit the \"Godfather\"-franchise. I can think only of the 3 movies that were released. But who knows... Seeing that Paramount just released a show based on the 1980's movie \"American Gigolo\" and another movie based on \"Top Gun\" makes me think that we may possibly see another Godfather show or movie! The question will then be how close it can come to the quality of the original Godfather trilogy.", "It is a fairly good Mafia Movie !!!": "Marlon Brando was a great actor, who could amply improve a given role by his own imagination and Method based on his raw, visceral and natural acting style. He could add many dimensions to a given character /role by his own charismatic personality, demeanor and voice. People will never forget Stanley Kowalski of \"A street Car Named Desire\", Napoleon Bonaparte of \"Desiree\" and Christian Fletcher of \"The Mutiny on the Bounty\". He was definitely a living legend of his time, a towering personality over other contemporary actors.Mario Puso's Godfather owes a lot to Marlon Brando, who was shown as an aging patriarch (Don Vito Corleone) teaching tricks of the underworld ominous trade to his young cub,(Michael Corleone) portrayed by Al-Pacino. As the young role demanded, Al-Pacino's innocent face and if not simple, straight acting style was appropriate while the old man's (Brando's ) visage bore the complexities of life's bitter machinations that were required of him to get to the top rung of the clandestine Mafia Empire.It is beautifully directed while punctuating the cinematic sequence with retrospective details of the elder Corleone's youth. It takes the audience to the old times with a pensive setting that approaches the status quo/wealth and waste of American Underworld.Howsoever great the title and story of this movie as well the acting skills of Marlon Brando, but it cannot be regarded as the all time great movie EVER MADE. There is more to the Mafia and Underworld than meets the eye after watching this movie. The human intellect is endowed with exploring and implementing even more innovative ways of the negative side as one can imagine.Nevertheless, it is a good effort at revealing the gory and ruthless side of the criminal dark world.", "Still the Classic Mob Movie": "This movie really is at or near \"perfect\" level filmmaking. The writing, directing and especially acting are all superb. What a great cast, what a great story (based on a great novel by Puzo)... no matter how many times I watch it, I never get tired of The Godfather.", "After Thoughts": "What can I say that hasn't already been said about the Godfather. It's a masterpiece that is perfect in every way. The casting is perfect, the score is perfect, the story is perfect! It's a perfect movie! This was the first mafia/organized crime film I ever saw. I was 10 and was completely stary eyed when I finished it for the first time. Being from a long line of Italians, the personal mannerism they use in thier day to day life is perfect and authentic. And every actor in this movie acted so so good. If I could I would give an Oscar to every person in this film. If you are not convinced to watch and love the Godfather by all the other reviews I don't know what else I can say to change your mind.", "Excellent film...not number 1 though...": "This movie is said to be the number one movie of all time on here, IMDb's top 250 movies of all time.I disagree. In my humble opinion that spot is reserved for Citizen Kain, Casablanca, or perhaps even Akira Kurosawa's classic, The Seven Samurai.With that said, this movie is an excellent film. This movie shows us the intricacies of the mafia. Instead of being a film about the mafia concerned with killing and drug dealing and such, we see the family waiting for the next hit or planning a deal or whatever it may be. It is a movie about family and what happens on the inside of the mafia.The film draws you in and makes you feel as if you are part of the family. Al Pacino is incredible and his character arc is done so well, I don't know if anyone else could have pulled it off. Marlon Brando is great as Don Vito Corleone.This is an amazing film. I give it a 10 out of 10. A must see. But again, I don't agree that it is the number one film of all time. Everyone has their opinion though.", "An Offer One Can't Refuse": "In the spring of 1968, Paramount Pictures bought Mario Puzo's novel treatment \"The Godfather\" for $12,500 against $75,000 if it became a finished book. When filming of it began three years later, the relatively unknown Francis Ford Coppola was hired to direct. Coppola had just made the box-office failure \"The Rain People\", so Paramount counted on him to be malleable and work for a fairly low salary.The movie opens in New York City in the late 1940s. The youngest son of a powerful Mafia boss returns from service in the war to find himself slowly being drawn into the family's brutal business.Unfortunately Coppola and Paramount fell out with each other immediately. The director wanted Marlon Brando as the Mafia boss, but the movie company firmly opposed that choice. They meant that the actor was hopelessly pass\u00e9 and that he also was extremely difficult to work with. But, after being threatened with dismissal several times, Coppola finally got his way and was able to hire Brando.The row flared up again when Coppola explained that he intended to travel to Sicily to shoot the scenes where Michael Corleone is in Italy. Paramount Pictures responded by contacting veteran director Elia Kazan, asking him to take over the film. The situation didn't calm down until Coppola showed the executives at Paramount some of his beautiful and exciting rushes from the Mediterranean island.The movie opened in five theaters in the New York area before moving to over 300 theaters nationwide. And it was breaking records everywhere. Later the same year the film overtook the previous all-time box office champion, \"Gone With the Wind\". In 1998, the American Film Institute then named \"The Godfather\" one of the greatest American movies ever made, testifying to its enduring artistic legacy. Francis Ford Coppola's triumph was complete.", "This is literally the perfect film, there is no other way someone logical can put it.": "One of cinema's greatest achievements. Trimming the fat of the source novel while keeping the mature spirit, The Godfather is an essential watch for anyone who claims to love movies.", "Almost a perfect story of the Sicilian family crime syndicate in the early 20th Century in America": "The movie is based on Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and tells a story of an organized crime family that has moved to America to create a fortune and gather the ultimate respect of the surrounding world.Francis Ford Coppola has directed a masterpiece that lives in its own time and can easily be watched as many times as possible without losing its touch. The movie is quite long and has couple of scenes that are at the same time very violent and very beautiful. Cruel murders are committed and the beautiful music that is played in the background creates an enormous mix of color and sound that has very powerful affect on the viewer who will follow the storyline dazed and amazed. The classic horse head scene, the wedding, murder of NY Police Captain, watching a young war hero to become a ruler of cruel gangster syndicate is just must see scenes", "Cinematic Storytelling at Its Best": "It's among the most famous, celebrated, parodied and influential films ever made. Adapted from the book by Mario Puzo, this is a clear demonstration of the fact that film adaptations do not have to be the poor relation of the original novel. For the few who may not have seen it, the film is centred around two characters: firstly, there's Don Corleone, a man of power and influence who exists in the penumbra of crime and respectability. He is ruthless but also humane, powerful yet vulnerable, wise and simultaneously stubborn. He is charged with taking care of his \"family\", including blood relations and his wider organisation, which is built on the Sicilian model of organised crime. In order to maintain his position of influence in a shifting and complicated political landscape, he must be judicious in his decision-making, picking his battles as appropriate and channelling his resources as prudent. Then there is his youngest son: Michael Corleone. Initially he wishes to have no involvement in the family business; he wants to be a fully-fledged American and to let go of the murky ties to his Sicilian heritage and its connection with clandestine murder and violence. He serves in the army during WW2 and is decorated for his service. But, as his father starts to lose his grip on power and the Corleone family find themselves thrust into severe peril, the duty falls to him to step into the centre of events. He demonstrated his heroism for his country, now he must do the same for his family. The question is, at what cost to himself and the wholesome American life that he had been on the verge of building?This film is an absolute marvel in story-telling. In Michael Corleone, it essentially takes the mold of the hero's journey with a character beginning in inauspicious circumstances, from the perspective of the mafia world in which he finds himself embroiled, to facing test after test which will prove his valour, strength, will and determination. His fate is partially foreshadowed by his father, however. Uneasy is the head that wears a crown, there is great responsibility and sacrifice which comes with power and influence and the trajectory of both central characters' journeys are demonstrations of this. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is gloriously atmospheric, the supporting cast are all exceptional and make the film a rich, profoundly engaging spectacle. The acting by two of the greatest film actors there ever were: Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, is sheer magic to behold and Coppola pulls the strings of Puzo's narrative beautifully, creating an epic that is one of the films which defines cinema to this day.", "One of the greatest gangster movies in movie history": "The movie tells a romantic gangster epic in a cool and gloomy style. It is one of the greatest gangster movies in the history of film, known as the man's Bible. After 48 years of dramatic changes in the film market, it can still live in everyone's heart. This film not only has made great success in comment, art and box office, but also set a good example for later generations. It is a classic film praised by many people. In this film, the main purpose is not only to tell the story, but also to establish a correct value orientation for the audience.", "Quite simply, the finest story ever put on film.": "Watch any other film and tell me it is better... The only legitimate argument is the sequel. The story,  the photography, the casting,  an artistic statement of the first degree.", "Number 1 on IMDB for MANY reasons": "This movie is a true classic.  EVERYTHING about this movie is good.  The directing, the acting, the sets, the screenplay, etc.....  My favorite character was of course Michael.  But, the rest of the cast is also worth note.  Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is one of my favorites, as is Diane Keaton as Kay.  The story itself is not just a underworld crime drama.  It is also about a simple immigrant family who is just trying to get along in the world.  It is also about the relationship between Michael and Kay.  It is also about the changing relationship between Michael and Tom.  This movie had two sequels including Part II which also won the Best Picture Oscar when it came out.  This is something that hadn't been done before and hasn't been done since.  The sequel to any movie is not supposed to be as good as the original.  However, Part II was as good if not better than Part I.  Bravo!", "My second favorite movie": "Behind Schindler's List, this is my second all-time favorite movie.  It is so rich in detail, and style, and acting.  EVERYTHING that is on the screen has a purpose, and EVERY bit of dialog is important.  If not at the moment, then a few frames later.  It is without a doubt the best movie in the mob genre.  If it wasn't for this movie, movies like Goodfellas, and Casino could NEVER have been made.  One comment on The Godfather Part II.  While it is great and most certainly deserved every award it got (including best pic), it is simply not as good as this one.", "Great once its got going": "The film is an all round great.It really starts to shine however about half way through, after that it never looks back and neither can you.From that moment on your eyes are fixed on the screen.Its a must see movie so if you haven't had the honour of seeing it yet then i advise you do so.Probably one of the best gangster films ever to be created.Marlon Brando places himself above the bar with his performance as thee Godfather.You basically can't go wrong with Marlone Brando and Al Pacino in the same film on top form throughout.After watching your'll probably never look at a horses head in the same way though, or fall out with anyone who knows you have a horse.A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!", "\"The Godfather\" of all movies.": "\"The Godfather\" is much, much more than a great film - it's a legendary film, regarded by thousands as the greatest ever made. And its continual reign at the top of the IMDb.com top 250 proves this. There have been so many reviews written about this movie and its subsequent sequels, so much written about it - not only here on this website but in magazines, books, universities, the whole caboodle - that someone like me has to be careful that their review doesn't go over too much old ground and become boring. Unfortunately, to a large extent, \"The Godfather\" is famous for people being unanimous about what makes it so good and so I will probably have to repeat what countless others have said.Certainly one can not fault the story itself - a magnificent tale of life in the Mafia and, in particular, of the development of the youngest son of Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino). The screenplay, adapted by Mario Puzo and Coppola from Puzo's own novel, is a breathtaking affair of first-class writing and suspense, and is a fine example of what is sadly missing in many of today's films. The fact that we, as an audience, are drawn into this world by the way in which it takes its time to unravel its many different layers is something that a lot of filmmakers don't consider today.Take, for example, the scenes after the attempted murder on Corleone. The audience are told exactly what is going to happen with Michael's revenge, so that everything will seem plausible when the time comes. Think about it; if we had cut straight to the scene in the restaurant after Michael's announcement that he is going to kill Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) then the fact that Michael finds a gun in the bathroom would seem ridiculous and we would not believe it. It is like this throughout all the film - everything is explained to us, every last piece of information needed to tell us why this thing happens later on in the film, why he dies at this moment. It means that the movie takes its time - the DVD version I have is aprox. 164 minutes long - but in a sense you lose track of time because you are so engrossed in the story.The acting is superb, not just Pacino or Brando, though these two do stand out, but the whole cast, even the extras in Sicily. Again, like every nook of the script, Coppola uses and manipulates every actor's potential to get the performance we deserve as an audience. There's a wonderful scene before the one mentioned earlier where the sons and Tom are discussing what to do next and they're all talking over each other. Utterly believable and excellent.The film is shot beautifully. I'm no expert on this area and I do try to steer clear of it in reviews, but there's no doubt at how gorgeous the whole film looks. The colour is vibrant, and yet the shadows play such an important part in the key scenes. I believe it really reaches its full potential in the scenes in Sicily, truly capturing the beauty of the country, which in turn is transposed to the beauty of Appollina.There are one or two flaws - after all, there has never been and never will be an utterly perfect film, despite what some people say - which are also, ironically, perfectly plausible. The female characters are weak and although this is obviously demonstrating the role of the woman in the Mafian society, Diane Keaton's character could have been stronger. Also, although wonderfully written, the script does need paying attention to, otherwise you are going to find yourself lost in a maze of Italian names.What you cannot argue against, however, is the violence. Yes, \"The Godfather\" is a violent film, but the great thing about this violence is that Coppola only uses it WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. Unlike many films today, the violence in this movie is essential to the plot, to keep it driving on and also to give us a fantastic character study of Michael, particularly towards the end of the movie.Enough's being said; if you haven't seen this movie you HAVE to see it, just to see what all the fuss is about. That's what I did, and it turned out all right for me. I mean, I haven't found a horse's head in my bed....yet.9/10", "Camera": "A musician lives with his wife in a small house in Dallas, Texas. They are looking for a new home and planning their move. She tells him that before she moves away from a place, she likes to hide a note for herself there, in case she ever returns. They occasionally hear strange noises in the house; one night they hear a loud bang in their living room, which contains a piano that came with the house. They cannot find the source of the noise.The next morning, the husband is killed in a car accident in front of their house. At the hospital, his wife views his body before covering it with a sheet. The man awakens as a ghost, still covered in the sheet, and wanders through the hospital, invisible to others. A door of light opens before him, but he makes no attempt to approach it, and it closes. He walks home and watches his wife grieve. The seasons change. Through a window, he sees another sheet-covered ghost inside the house next door; the two ghosts wave to one another.One night the wife arrives home with a man, whom she kisses. The ghost makes lights flicker and knocks books from a shelf. Later, as the wife listens to a song by her late husband, she recalls listening to it with him. She eventually decides to move out. Before she leaves, she writes a short note and hides it in a gap in a wall. The ghost picks at the gap but cannot retrieve the note.", "The classic tale of a Mafia family. Not for kids.": "Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo bring the famed-mafia novel to life. The Godfather is an excellent portrayal of power, betrayal and family. Beautifully written and stunningly executed, the film is a landmark motion picture with stunning performances (Brando, Pacino, Caan) that is still held up to this day as a timeless classic.\nSpectacular. Every time I see it, it gets better. From its flawless direction, to its exceptional score, to its (near-)flawless script, I have no doubt \"The Godfather\" is one of the best movies ever made.", "A Masterpiece, One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made": "The Godfather had many in awe during its prime, and it still does today. One of the greatest organized crime films ever created, let alone one of the greatest movies ever created, it shows that anything goes as a mobster in the Itlian mafia. Al Pacino became world famous for his role as Micheal Corleon, son of Don Vito Corleon (Marlon Brando), as he prepares to take the family business from his father. As an Italian myself, I can greatly appreciate what this film is trying to do... show what life is really like as a mobster, and what they practically do. Forget the mobster movie flops, or the Sopranos, this movie shows it all. And to follow it up with an even greater sequel is incredible. It's a masterpiece, a must-see by far.", "THis movie is almost as long and boring as Titanic": "I guess i can see why some people like this movie, a boring film will attract boring people, But i am an adventurist, and if it takes more than 3 hours to tell a story, then i dont want to hear it. This movie put me to sleep, and i can honestly say i had a wonderful NAP while this movie took place. The story is slow, not very eventful, just has the sparatic havic scenes like the bad al pacino movie HEAT. Anyways, if you like pacino, fine, be my guest, But this film is far from number 1 in my opinion", "No other movie can touch it.": "Hmmmm... well... I spent some time thinking about what I would write about this movie. First off, I am very disappointed I can\u00b4t give this movie a 11. Because you see... it is that good. It is nothing more and nothing less than perfection- if they cut a part of the moive, I would miss it. If they add anything to it, I would discard it. Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?I am very sad a lot of people that voted for American Beauty made it look like as good as this one. I mean... we cannot compare both movies, can we? If this one drops one rank because of pityful American Beauty, i will be very sad. And I just can imagine anyone giving this one a 1. 7 at least. Not 1 or 2 or 3. People who give ratings like this to a movie such as The Godfaher must only like unimaginative amateur movies such as American Beauty. Sorry I am talking about another movie, but I just can\u00b4t imagine The Godfather loosing one rank to American Beauty.", "One of the best and most memorable film experiences.": "The Godfather is without a doubt, one of cinema's most adored pieces of celluloid in history and is loved by universally everyone. Without question, it is indeed fantastic in every sense of the word and with this one, it may be completely justified to believe all the hype. The story centers on a young Al Pacino as the youngest son of an Italian-American mafia family headed by the great Marlon Brando in arguably his most iconic role. As things take a nasty turn for the family in relation to other competing mafia families, Michael (Al Pacino) gradually plummets his way into the dark and unforgiving world of crime. While the film is an adaptation of the book by the same name written by Mario Puzo, rest assured this picture has a flare entirely of its own. Thanks for Francis Ford Coppola, we're treated to a perfectly crafted story with incredible characters, breathtaking performances, and beautiful story-telling.First thing to note about the performances: every member of this fully-loaded cast of talent is on top of their game and if you've seen any of these actors at the peak of their powers, prepare to see it all at once. What makes the atmosphere so immersive besides brilliant performing is also an iconic musical score that you'll remember for years. Much like the bleak yet humanizing tone of the film, the score portrays a somber and harrowing theme of crime, revenge, murder, yet contrasted with very human emotions like regret, grief, and genuine sorrow. The Godfather has also become famous for it's unique cinematography provided by Gordon Willis. Every shot feels like a beautiful and dark painting that speaks volumes to the characters and their tragic journeys to the point of no return. Cinematically, The Godfather is outstanding and quite frankly, perfect. Any gripes with the film would find some minor plot details that felt irrelevant to the story or any major character arcs. Minor flaws aside, this film is truly one of the greatest movies ever made and personally the most memorable modern tragedy. It's one everyone should see no matter who you are because it's an unforgettable experience.", "Timeless cinematic excellence": "As long as movies exist, The Godfather will always be relevant and stand out as one of the all time best.  When most people think of a perfect movie, this one comes to mind, and for good reason. Every single aspect of filmmaking is executed down to the finest detail with flawless results, most notably the violence, which is graphic but never gratuitous. The ensemble acting is arguably the best ever, with every performance being beliveable and memorable. The story of a mafia family trying to survive amidst a crumbling empire is very compelling, but it's much more than a mafia movie. It's a story about family and the importance of staying together.\nOver the years, The Godfather has become nothing less than an American institution, inspiring several imitations as well as parodies and creating many phrases and expressions that have made their way into pop culture. There is something in The Godfather that appeals to everyone and every generation. For this, it will always find favor with the masses and truly remain a timeless classic of cinema.", "This will live forever": "When you feel. That's it nothing more.

It's late and I have to get up a little early tomorrow. But it is not early enough to delay writing these lines. Now that I've seen it three times, the opportunity to share my thoughts and refreshed insights is too much of a good offer to sit down. Hang on with me.", "The Definition Of A Movie (The Godfather)": "There is only one movie, one movie that stands out in my mind when I think cinema. It Is...The Godfather. Its The Movie you can watch many times and still find something new you didin't notice your previous viewings. Its the movie where you can learn more about the characters every moment of the film. Its the movie that shows the true 1940's mafia. It is the definition of a movie.Whether its the astonishing script, the incredible cast, and the amazing acting, you'll find something you'll like in this movie. Even if you hated this movie and disposes it, you can always say 1 thing you liked about it, at least 1 thing. As for the acting, Marlon Brando does one of the most memorable performances in the history of film-making. He plays the role of Vito Corleone, the head of one of the five families in New York City. He has 3 influential and historical actors as his son's. Michael being Al Pacino's part, plays his son, a young boy who just returned from world war II, not wanting anything to do with the family. Second, being the infamous James Caan, playing the hot headed Sonny, wanting to take over the family business when vito passes. Then There is Fredo, the poor, dimwitted, fredo, played by John Cazale.Along with the cast is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the adopted son into the family, with irish blood at heart. Diane Keaton also does a fantastic job as a young woman dating Michael, not knowing what to expect.The Movie provides something everyone will enjoy, if its the violence you like, you have a lot of it. If its intriguing storyline, bada bing...you have it. Or if you just want to see a nice cast, and one of the best movies ever made....You have it. There is no doubt that this movie will remain in your head after you see it, and its spawned many fans from all over the world. Its a tearjerker, a noir, a love story, and a movie about the mafia. As I have said before, It is the definition of a Movie.A 12/10 rating A++++", "the god father!!!": "I think this the best movie after shawshank rademption\nthis movie has marlon brando and al pacino and There is nothing left to say!!!", "\"...wherever he goes, death follows...\" F.F. Coppola on Michael Corleone": "The Great Contribution to Cinema and American History itself... because, let's face it: If you're not part of any religious or ethnic minority in the good-ol' US-of-A (and we all came from another country; American Indians being the only true Natives), then the Godfather franchise means nothing to you except slickly-packed violence.  A masterpiece of American filmmaking; less derivative and more seminal than other films previous and since.  Novelist-screenwriter Mario Puzo and screenwriter/director Francis Ford Coppola care for the characters they wrought here, and the two sequels. Maybe not all of their individual efforts work for us, but they are still products of meticulous filmmaking, and each Godfather film deserves a serious examination in this esthetic sense.Godfather lays down the groundwork, introducing us to Don Corleone and his sons, each of which have their own tragic destinies.  The Don's youngest son, Michael, prooves to be the wisest and most formidable, and takes over the Family Seat.Godfather Part II gives us the Don's family history in Sicily, and Michael's transformation into a paranoid 'monster.'Godfather Part III examines Michael's pain, panic and remorse, for having gone this far (1979) and not having become \"legitimate.\"\nActors Al Pacino and Talia Shire each grew and became better, thespian-wise, through these three aforementioned Godfather installments, and deserve recognition for their efforts.", "Classic movie": "This classic has lasted the test of time. Always great to watch.", "Blurring morality": "This breathtaking masterpiece tells the story of a crime family through it's rich script and dilemmas. The film has you the minute it starts with the profoundly sympathetic character at the start with his monologue about his daughters circumstances. From start to finish it blurs the lines between good and bad, black and white and begs the question of loyalty, family and power. The crime family with so much power and control cannot control their own family and it's affairs, ironic isn't it? Marlon Brando's performance is the epitome of flawless acting and Al Pacino's acting is seamless and sharp. The film does drag in some parts in my opinion but every film has its flaws and cannot be perfect because perfection is subjective. This film took the books version and perfectly puts it onto film, some say and even in my opinion is better than the book itself.", "really Godfather of all movies": "I re-watch this movie after almost 2 year. While at first time i watch i feel little bored bcz of its slowly build up story. But when plot move forward it became more interesting. Not only me others my friends also felt same.

And i alos gonna rewatch its 2nd and 3rd part .", "Well this is called a film.......but i hope": "The Godfather is a good script by Mario Puzo to be cast into a motion picture but its Francis Ford Coppola who really drilled the task. This movie marks a landmark in the history of films.Just to be short, i must say that such kind of cinematography, execution, acting, and atmosphere is unique in these series that is rare to be found anywhere else. A great story and amazingly huge drama sets off the viewer out of his movie making knowledge and put him into a different world of gangsters and revenge but still there is something that shines for comfort in their families.So well this is called a film.......but i hope such great films instead of showing what they showed, should show others love and life. I am saying this just because there is a huge amount of potential in such movies to do what they want to do.", "Incredible is an understatement...": "The Godfather is an absolutely fantastic movie.

Marlon Brando, with cotton stuffed in his mouth, gives yet another ridiculous scenery chewing performance as Don Corleone-the cat sitting in his lap was more interesting. The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better. This is one boring-assed movie. A lot of hand kissing, '40s automobiles, \"family values\", and the most lazy and repetitive score I've ever heard. This is a classic? Audiences must have been seriously desperate back in 1972.", "Perfect balance": "Considered by many as \"the best film in history\", 'The Godfather' has earned a prestige and respect over the years, something fully deserved.\nTo speak of 'The Godfather' is to speak of a perfect balance, a masterful balance between an epic Gangsters story, a powerful family drama and a man's personal conflict. All these themes are carried by Coppola in such a fluid way that nothing ends up feeling forced within the story. And although it is true, there are a large number of plots, characters and relationships, the aforementioned fluidity of the narrative, added to a technical perfection to tell the story, causes all these elements to have an impact on the narrative, which is pretty intuitive. Each factor is decisive and influences history, something that every filmmaker aspires to achieve, but that no one can say has achieved as Coppola.\nIt is difficult to define cinematographic perfection, but if this were a conflict that encompasses all its characters and that all the factors play in order to tell the story in the best possible way, then we can consider that 'The Godfather' is a perfect work.", "The best movie of all time": "Probably the best movie of all time. Everything is so good that an almost perfect work has emerged. It is a movie that will shine like a star in the world of cinema for years.

The Writing is \"dead-on\" brilliant and comes from a best-seller masterpiece. The Cinematography is a very good visual presentation and the Set Design is very true to the '40s time period.The director Coppola makes due with all the right elements despite having a history of not making as many good book-to-movie adaptations like \"The Outsiders\" and \"Apocalypse Now.\"This is both one of the films movie-lovers should see before they die and simply because it inspired tons of movies in this genre that were nothing compared to this masterpiece.", "Worthy of its Oscar": "This was a classic that won best picture, and it was a long movie. This length was actually a necessary evil, however, as a lot went on during the course of the film and it's multiple reversals as well as requiring the time to not only introduce a myriad of characters, but fill them out to be real people.It took about 45 minutes for this film to pick up some steam and start going due to getting everyone introduced, but being a drama based on a book, the direction changed a few times during the course of the film. This slow start is at once alleviated on a second viewing, however, since knowing the characters the second time around, you \"get\" everything a lot more clearly and the momentum is obvious from the get-go.Vito Corleone is the Godfather, not only of the Corleone clan, but of many of the people he has come into contact with over the years, particularly in the Italian community. He creates many give and take relationship with a lot of people, and follows through on them. The first part of the film focuses on Vito and his reign as Don, then the focus shifts to between his sons, Michael and Sonny when the Don runs into a bit of trouble. Once Michael is placed center stage as the main character, and even on a first viewing, this was the point where the film really got into its groove and took off.It got a little slow while Michael ran off to Sicily, and that all seemed like a big side story we could deal without, but it allowed Sonny's reign to come and go, which was not necessarily a pleasant thing.The characters, as I said, were numerous and well-rounded, and it's just astounding how well they were drawn throughout the film. Granted, the length of the film allowed this luxury and a shorter film likely would have dropped all those little moments which make these fictional characters seem real, but it worked so well.It ended up being a solid film and certainly worthy of its Oscar. However, this movie should only be approached if you're in the mood to be thought-provoked.", "One of the best movies ever made": "Widely viewed around the world as one of the best American films ever made, the opening movie from the crime saga The Godfather is a milestone of cinema history. The Godfather, together with Star Wars, from 1972 has become one of the most parodied movies ever. Director Francis Ford Coppola paints an amazing portrait of the Corleone clan's rise and near fall from power in the US as well as in Italy. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully manages to balance the story between the Corleone's family life and the vast crime business in which they are engaged.The story views the Mafia from the inside as Francis Ford Coppola saw it, and as Mario Puzo did when he originally wrote the book in which he portrayed the story presented here. This movie is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon, capicce.", "Flawless, just flawless.": "The Godfather is one of those movies, that will take a straight up evil and bad man and make him look human.

Although I prefer \"Psycho\" (1960), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994), there isn't much to argue against The Godfather.\nIt is the pinnacle of flawless storytelling. Seeing how Michael evolves from an innocent young man into the role of the cities biggest Mafia boss, is both gripping and in some ways even fascinating.The acting, oh boy. Marlon Brando is perfect. Al Pacino is perfect. Everybody else is perfect. What is there to say about The Godfather that has not been said. Great cinematography, perfect editing, perfect acting, perfectly structured, brilliant storytelling and some of the most iconic shots and scenes of all time.10/10", "It was... OK": "look i understand how many people love this film; good acting, pretty solid storyline, etc... but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward. i am a teenager, and while i do love guns, killing, and all that good \"teenage stuff\" that is in this movie, many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers. i feel that they are a thing of the past, and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest, and basically, don't love it as much as many people seem to. Having said this, i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather, not because of the mafia ties, but the struggles that the man character underwent; struggles that i can identify with. this was something \"The Godfather\" lacked.again, its not bad... its just... OK", "A Classic That Almost Wasn't": "There is no praise I can make that has not yet been said here, except that after having read the book in a single sitting I was enraptured by this film. There is no flaw in any frame. The period detail is beautiful and atmospheric, the tension between the actors in preparation for the violent conflicts is contagious, and the intensity of the performances pulls the viewer right into the characters' world. It is easy to understand how the characters in THE SOPRANOS fall in love with this film and want to see themselves in it.Few films are as loyal to its source material as this one, and simultaneously become the stuff of legends. THE GODFATHER has as many casting legends about it as GONE WITH THE WIND, which is appropriate, as this has been called the GWTW of the 70s.We must give special praise to Francis Ford Coppola for refusing to cave in to studio pressure to cast Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford as Michael. While that would have brought people to the box office, none of them would want to see this film again and the video version would be in the bargain bin, never to be re-released. Al Pacino IS Michael Corleone; no one else could have done this character nearly as well.Because this integrity is all but gone, this may be one of the last classics of American film.", "Unquestioned masterpiece of 70's cinema": "I am not going to get into extensive detail on how great this film is, hundreds if not thousands before me have already done so and to good credit. As a Hollywood director has once previously stated on another non-Godfather film commentary track, watching the film is a cinema class in of its self... if you are going to watch only one film in your life, it is this one. I must agree, I watch this film repeatedly, not only to be entertained but also to study as a filmmaker myself. \nObviously the many directors who turned down the assignment to direct this adapted script had a strong moral objection to glorify the mafia, and I agree, there is absolutely \"nothing\" glamorous about real life gangsters in organized crime. But this is a fictional tale and Coppola used his own strong Italian American heritage to infuse the film with far greater themes and family bonding than any of the other directors originally approached would have done. He raised this film from the exploitative gangster flick that it was slotted to be by the studio, even wanting to change the novel's 1940's setting to modern day to save money on the budget, to that of Shakespearian levels and the best example of film art in Hollywood films. Coppola well deserved the Oscar, fame and the money that followed the film's release, in my opinion anyway.\nPerhaps it is because I saw this film as a youngster and accepted the film as is, as many others I watched, good and cheesy, but watching it even now there doesn't seem to be a single bad shot or angle in the entire film, except one.... Diane Keaton's false \"double-take\" reaction to the exploded vehicle in the back ground when she is confronted by Tom as she returns to the Mall to see Michael. It always takes me out of the film.", "Simply a masterpiece.": "The Godfather is written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall and Richard Conte.The ageing patriarch of an organised crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.Whenever you get into a discussion with someone about filmmaking or ask about their favourite movies of all time, at some point they will mention The Godfather. There's a very simple explanation for this, and it's something to be discovered when experiencing the movie for yourself.It's very clear how incredibly well written this movie is, from the first scene, to the last. Not only the writing, but the magnetic performances throughout are consistently showcased against a backdrop of New York from 1945-1955. One of the reasons this movie is so beautiful is because of how realistic it is. Although we can't say we've been a part of an empire like featured in the movie, we can all relate to the characters. It's a dark and tragic story.The acting as aforementioned is phenomenal. Brando is vitally important in his convincing portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. As is Al Pacino as he gradually becomes the front-man during the movie's running-length. Caan has a heart-breaking turn in his character's arc, and he performs wonderfully. The same for Duvall, Conte and everyone else not mentioned. The list is too long to name each individual, but they don't go unnoticed.Although this is a long movie, there's so much going on and in such intricate detail that the time effortlessly drifts by. Every character has a chance to transform within the time-frame. Don't be put off by the duration. Many filmmakers these days are afraid of making their work too long, but if done correctly, it can be a tremendous piece of art. This movie is a fine example of that fact.The original score by Nino Rota is one of the most recognised soundtracks of all time, and respectfully so. There are moments where his music is used greatly, and moments where it isn't used at all. While this happens the music is changing also. It's the perfect sound for such a story, and pairs with the picture brilliantly.Verdict; The Godfather is widely regarded as a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of our time. I can fully agree with these statements and add that in its many years since release, it hasn't aged a bit. If you haven't yet experienced The Godfather, please do yourself a favour. With so much greatness in front of you, it's an offer you can't refuse.The Godfather, 10/10.", "Fabulous movie": "I absolutely appreciate all the artists of this movie, And character of Michael is superb.", "Still a masterpiece!": "It's true, this is still a masterpiece! But you didn't need me to tell you that.", "Almost nothing": "A film about post war US life. Maybe I was tired while watching it but anyway I was disappointed. Nothing more than gangster movie at all. Marlon Brando is excellent though... I`m not going to say that it`s chicken-feed but from my point view it has artificially created reputation. La Piovra - italian tv-series is much better in every point.", "One of the Greatest Films I've ever watched": "This movie was fantastic. I see why people call GodFather one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of those movies that just feel so real. I see a lot of other mafia films trying to use this kinda of style but GodFather is on another level. I applaud\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b", "nice movie": "Really i love this movie,and i love all the characters,i appreciating this film.", "I want to rate it 10 million stars, but i only have 10...": "The greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. Unbelievable acting by all actors specially by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Brilliant script, story and the plot. This movie is perfect from every spot. You can't find a single flaw in the whole film. This film will be remembered for centuries and is gonna take some effort to beat even after all these years!", "Great movie but overrated": "Watching a 3 hour long movie it's not a easy task unless you really enjoy the story and every single moment of it, but I really had to give this a try to find by myself if it really lives up to his hype.\nNeedless to say, the acting is by far the best thing in this movie especially Marlon Brando in his unforgettable Don Corleone role. The cinematography is very good too and the only critics I have is some flaws in shooting scenes were the gun is fired but the body doesn't get marked and some fighting scenes were they were literally punching the air but I would let that slip because they didn't had much of the technology that we have nowadays.\nMy biggest problem regarding this movie is pacing, like I've said in the beginning it's hard to watch a 3 hour long movie unless everything works perfectly and in this movie there were a lot of scenes way to bigger than the necessary, things that could be summoned in a shorter way and still with good cinematography were too long, and there are some unnecessary shots. The movie also advance years and it could've been done better, in a scene you are in the present and in the next you are some years later without no mention to how many time passed or even that the time passed you only understand that by the action, which if you aren't really concentrated will become confusing and It's hard to see a 3 hour long movie with long boring shots and confusing timeline.\nThe acting is the only top-notch thing here, everything else is just good.", "Fantastic!": "One of the best movie of all time!\nEveryone should watch this movie.", "Brilliance.": "The greatest American movie of all time, the Godfather marked a new era of film making much closer to the old studio system style. It was also an early example of a new appraoach to film-making ushered in by new wave of directing talent. Known as the Movie Brats, an including The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola and the likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, they were directors emerging through the study of the film medium in the 1960's and here it definitely shows. Coopla brings in a new innovative, stately style and substance to the production.Coppola takes the classic gangster genre and, complete with an all star cast and a brilliant, perfectly judged and written screenplay, turns the film into an epic work of beauty. Every scene is beautifully and perfectly composed, with the composition owing much to the classic Italian Reniassance era, in particular the of Caravaggio. The dark, warm colours make the film look a painting; a work of art to be more precise. Coppola direction is masterful, evoking classic Hollywood film-making elements, such as the close-up up and shot-reverse-shot, as well as new innovative forms of film-making including tracking shots coupled with the delicate use of sound and precise cross-cutting editing. He is helped by a wonderful script, co-written with Mario Puza, a lush score by Nino Rota and a masterclass in acting from everyone involved, particularly Brando and Pacino. A brilliant, visceral riveting, flawless masterpiece, quite possibly the greatest film ever made.10/10", "What's First or Second...?": "Well, When first time I watched The movie it was not so cool to me I mean not so well, I don't know my mind try to say go and watch that again well I watched again but this time 'not bad',Again third time my mind say go and watch again,Third time when I watched, It Was Masterpiece for AllTime!", "This *might* be the best picture in movie history.": "When Francis Ford Coppola is on, he is absolutely on. The Godfather, in all of its noirish glory, is brilliant in virtually every respect. It's hard to criticize it, so I'll just honor it some more.In The Grapes of Wrath (the novel), Ma Joad asks Tom if being in prison has made him \"mean-mad.\" She knew Pretty Boy Floyd's mother, and she recalls how Floyd started out as a nice boy who kept getting hurt time and again, and who eventually became a monstrous killer. Michael Corleone is the epitome of that concept. As soon as Vito says that Michael is not to enter the \"family business,\" you know that he will be damned. The movie is his struggle to overcome every single hurt that comes his way, especially when they involve the ones he loves most. You can watch him lose his soul as the movie progresses, and your heart breaks. Coppola and Pacino make you wonder if you should pity Michael, hate him, love him, admire him, condemn him, worship him. That's the difference between a film that skulks around the bottom of the Top 100 films ever made and a film that is always in the top three.", "The Rise of Michael Corleone": "The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time and I know this sounds very clich\u00e9 and predictable as it's been often repeated over the decades but there's truth to it. I remember watching this back in 2011 for the first time and my dumbass didnt like it and thought it was both boring and overratedFast Forward to 2022 and I love this movie, it is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen and you can damn well sure bet this is a masterpiece. Everything about this movie is so damn perfect from the beautiful soundtrack to the cinematography to the characters and the cast. This truly didnt feel like a movie to me, this felt like it was real life and there was no acting involved. It felt like we were apart of the Corleone family both personally and professionally along with the other mafia families.The character of Michael Corleone and seeing him go from war veteran who wanted no part of his father's mob family to literally taking in the reigns and becoming the Don himself is so badass. Al Pacino does a phenomenal job showing the evolution of Michael's story in this movie. What stands out to me most about Michael at least for now is the Baptism scene where he is being Baptised along with being Godfather to his little nephew while having the heads of the five families and associates murdered screamed pure evil and that Michael himself was like a Devil in disguise with his stone cold expression at the Church before cutting back to the more violent deathsThe violence was pretty brutal and as well as it should be as it's the Mafia afterall and there were some uncomfortable moments like the sub plot with a scene involving domestic abuse in the form of Michael's sister being abused by her partner but thankfully he gets what is coming to him in the endLoved this movie and Im so looking forward to watching part two and three in the next two days I can only imagine things get bigger and better from here on out.", "Best movie ever!": "The Godfather show us that a good movie remains forever a good movie. We should see all the little parts and all the sub-meanings that this movie brings. The cast is exceptional and Marlon Brando (may God have mercy of his soul) plays in a way that words can't describe it. Just watch the movie and enjoy it. It's the best movie ever! The Godfather II and III were only good, not exceptional like the first part. This is a once in a lifetime movie and it must be understood. I've read all sorts of articles and declarations of the actors, i know all the story of making the movie and that information, beside watching the movie convinced me that The Godfather will remain one of the best movies of the history. It should get more Oscars.", "The Family of the 20th Century": "From Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather, to me, was the movie of the 20th century. It had the perfect cast, screenplay, story, characters, set design, ect. It deserved every single Oscar that it was nominated for. The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family and their life of living in the Mafia territory. It tells how Don Vito (Marlon Brando) struggles to keep up with his business and how he will pass it on to his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino). The movie also tells about the life of Vito's oldest son Sonny (James Caan), the famous Fredo (John Cazele), and Vito's daughter Connie (Talia Shire).Produced by Mario Puzo (Superman) and directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Outsiders, Dracula). The Godfather is the greatest movie ever.Cast includes: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazele, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden.", "As no one can show light to the Sun as you wouldn't dare write a review for this masterpiece!": "Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. The Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances.", "Not bad but very overrated": "Film isn't bad, but there are film much better with less ratings. There's no way this is a 9.2. Goodfellas was way better than this.", "very nice": "Very good film...nice hold..actors are performed very good", "Fantastic.": "Its the godfather, what could go wrong. Only had problem with the little Italy part. Great editing. Mafia family told in a poetic way.", "Still resonates after all these years": "Wow, this is a great film. Repeated (and I do mean repeated) viewings have not changed its power to fascinate and enthrall after all these years. Like the great Greek tragedies, Godfathers I and II just speak the essential truth about humanity and familial relationships in a way that everyone can relate to and can use to understand their own lives. Great art has the power to do that. All of the elements - screenplay, cinematography, acting, music - come together just about perfectly. Perhaps it is because of an accident of time and place and circumstance, like Casablanca, but it is hard to imagine this film being done any other way, or being remade by anyone else, with another cast. Truly one of the essential movies in the cinematic canon.", "Just amazing": "This movie is a masterpiece from start to finish. The acting, music and directing is unbelievable. The greatest movie of all time.", "Celebration of organized crime": "The 3 movies represent over 9 hours of celebrating a mass murderer and a corporate criminal who is too street-smart always gets away with it.Good actors, excellent director, but the script is abominable.", "Award-winner lives up to reputation": "I was reluctant to watch The Godfather, as I heard it was gory and shrouded in symbolism, but my boyfriend talked me into seeing it.  I was pleasantly surprised, although I supposed I shouldn't have been since both The Godfather and its sequel won Oscars and a spot on AFI's Top 100 list.It's an artfully made movie, and Al Pacino's fall from grace was the highlight of the movie for me.  Marlin Brando's very believable don Corleone was not a hateful character--we do not see him held responsible for any civilian deaths or anyone completely innocent.  You get to like him, despite his less-than-honorable job.It helps to know a little about the movie before you watch it.  The symbolism is indeed thick here, and knowing such things like oranges=death makes it a more acessible film.  Also, Brando's attention to detail led him to stuff his cheeks with...was it cotton?--well, something, to achieve that \"bulldog look.\"  That strict dedication to the character on the actors' part, as well as Copolla's taut directing style and Puzo's terrific story line make The Godfather a worthy recipient of every prize it has earned.", "as a director": "I think if you want to learn story board of drama movie you must see this film.and break down the shots - its awesome movie for watching - the lighting is weak.", "The Story of Michael Corleone": "Al Pacino has played many great characters in motion pictures, including Serpico, Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Bobby Deerfield, Tony Montana, Frank Slade, Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno, and Jimmy Hoffa. The role for which he will be remembered is Michael Corleone. Pacino carries the entire trilogy, surfacing as the main protagonist in the first film opposite Marlon Brando. Brando got people into the theaters, but Pacino was the reason they kept coming back. Regarded as one of the best films in cinematic history, The Godfather is a classic story about the struggle of immigrants to America and the means one family pursues in order to rise from poverty. In addition to Pacino and Brando, John Cazale delivers an outstanding performance.", "This is one of these films which needs to seen before you die": "It is probably 7 or 8 years since I last saw this film but some films you never forget and this is a one of them. The subject matter is effectively an American family and the people who associate with them. Of course very few families are like the one that this film portrays. This film has a running time of nearly three hours and I have never met anyone who has had a negative comment to say about it. Anybody watching The Godfather for the first time may well have heard a certain amount of hype about it and in the case of this film the positive hype is all fully deserved. Like all great films you can look at it and say to yourself how could this film have been improved and in my opinion it could not have been improved. I had read the book first but this film brought the book to life in spectacular fashion. I have never been particularly interested in the numerous different elements in a film or all the politics surrounding it, I am more interested in the whole and this film does not disappoint on any level. Please watch this film at least once before you die you will not be disappointed.", "Short and clear": "This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.", "Its fine. But I am little dissappointed": "This is second highest rated movie of all the time. I had a lot expectations but its not upto the mark. First half of the movie is not that interesting. I am sorry if this makes an offense to the fans. In second half, when Mike takes over, things get interesting but story ends suddenly. Hopefully, for the next part of the movie.Current days, other Don movies like El Chapo are more interesting and thrilling as compared. I have rated it provided the time of its release and for the story.", "to that handsome old fellow": "When I was young, I thought it was exciting, my heart beat, and my male hormones burst into flames. now when I am older, I feel regretful.", "Amazing!": "Very amazing movie. This movie show you the what real Mafia is doing. It's not about the killing mostly. Must-watch movie. I recommend to everyone. An original.", "An important event in the history of American cinema": "Made in the last era of great Hollywood movies - the \u009170s - \"The Godfather\" today is as relevant, fresh and even groundbreaking as it was some thirty years ago. Jewels handcrafted with this much care are seldom made anymore. But even if they still were the order of the day, it would be truly hard to recapture something this revolutionary.Perfect movie in pretty much every way, \"Godfather\" starts off in celebratory atmosphere as the aging Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) receives \u0091clients' asking for favours while his daughter Connie (Talia Shire) is getting married outside. It's 1946, and through the events at the wedding we're getting a stylish introduction to the patriarchal mafia family - reasonable and wise old Don Vito with his three sons: hothead philanderer Sonny (James Caan), inadequate Fredo (John Cazale) and strong willed WW2 veteran Michael (Al Pacino) who's reluctant to enter the family business. From the shocking introductory vignette involving a horse's head and a Hollywood studio head (Copolla's not-so-subtle dig at the movie business) memorable scenes follow one another: attempt at Don Vito's life, a visit to his wounded father at the hospital which for young Michael ends up being the watershed event that pushes him over to 'the dark side', Sollazzo-McCluskey killings in the Bronx restaurant, Michael's subsequent exile in Sicily with tragic marriage to beautiful Apollonia, Sonny's assassination and the final sequence intertwining scenes of Michael attending his nephew's baptism as his capos are eliminating competing mafia heads and traitors within the family....It all takes place within a closed world where not being loyal is the only crime and everything functions according to those rules so that audience can understand, even sympathize with characters when they're exhibiting truly monstrous behaviour.There's no doubt in my mind this is a highly romanticized version of mafia business, but who cares \u0096 this movie is so much more. A true epic, that works on so many levels.", "A wonderful movie": "The best actors and screenwriters. I've seen the movie three times before. Worth seeing at least once.", "AN AMERCAN MASTERPIECE": "Francis Ford Coppola's classic landmark crime epic is one of the finest most riveting American films ever made. It is based upon Mario Puzo's best selling novel of the same name. Set in 1945 on Long Island it tells the tale of the most powerful Mafia family dynasty in America, which is led by the aging Don Vito Corleone, sensationally played by the late great Marlon Brando, who made a phenomenal career comeback with this brilliant Oscar winning performance. His youngest son Michael, played marvelously by Al Pacino in his breakout Oscar nominated performance, has just returned from serving with the Marines in World War II, and is attending the wedding of his beloved sister Connie, played wonderfully by Talia Shire. The joyful family occasion is short lived because of a ruthless drug dealer named Virgil Sollozzo, impressively played by the late great character actor Al Lettieri, who is looking for financial support as well as protection from the Corleone family. But when Don Vito refuses and turns down Sollozzo's request, he tries to have Don Vito assassinated by two hit men who gun him down outside a fruit stand, but Don survives the hit barely. This will set in motion a series of deadly events into play and a full scale Mob war will begin. Magnificent direction by Coppola, with impeccable supporting performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, and Abe Vigoda. Breathtakingly filmed with beautiful on location sequences shot in Sicily by the late great master cinematographer Gordon Willis, Nino Rota's unforgettable musical score is powerfully haunting. This is one of the few rare times where the film is better than the book. \"The Godfather\" is a history-making cinematic masterpiece that is the winner of three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor: Marlon Brando, and Screenplay: Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo.", "Pulp novel = movie masterpiece": "Back in 1972 I was much too intellectual to be interested in a movie based on a pulp novel. Then I was dragged to see \"The Godfather\" and my outlook on popular entertainment changed forever. If \"The Godfather\" was outstanding, how could \"Godfather II\" be better? I dunno, but it is. The movies spin a tale of family, and they illustrate how the sins of the fathers, even loving fathers, will cast tragedy across the generations. Steer clear of part III, a redundant tale that begged never to be made.", "The Best of the Mafia films": "When I first tried watching this movie, it was 3 AM and I could barely pay attention, and it seemed too long for me to watch. And then I watched Scarface, another very long Pacino movie, and I loved it. That movie helped me get used to long movies, and Pacino movies (it made me a huge fan of Pacino) so I tried The Godfather again, this time renting the newer THX Remastered version (which has great Stereo Sound, by the way) and I watched the whole thing, paying attention all the way through, and I loved it. The key to surviving parts of movies that aren't \"action-packed\" is to pay attention to the background. Soak it all up, the area, the surroundings, sometimes beautiful scenery (in which there is alot of in another great long movie, The Deer Hunter) If you haven't seen this movie, you should, don't be distracted by the \"hype\" the movie recieved which might make you think that's all it is, because all of the hype and spoofs it recieved were due to the magnificence of the film.", "A true classic in which you forget you're watching a movie": "What makes this movie so great is that the characters seem to leap off the screen, often after only a few minutes. I've never quite figured it out, but it's as if you already know these guys, their habits, their mannerisms, their strengths and faults. Like Clemenza, a guy you hate to love - he'd just as easily kill you as he would pick a weed off his lawn, yet you can't help but respect him. Respect him? What am I saying? But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary. Oddly enough, the only person who seems an ill fit is Michael, at the start that is. How can anyone so clean cut be related? But Pacino makes it work (unbelievable acting) and nothing is more engaging that watching the 'transformation' he goes through as he becomes the Don.", "my favorite gangster movie ever.": "THIS HAS A SPOILER IN IT!!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN IT!!!!!!I just saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, and i loved it. I had heard so much hype about it, and that it was the greatest movie ever, so I was skeptical. I was not disappointed; except when Sonny died, that just ruined my day. He was my favorite. This movie has everything that a good drama needs.Actors: Everyone that had a role of significance, played it to a tee. I never noticed any moments of \"I can't believe he just said that. This is like CSI:Miami.\" Characters: This movie got you to root for basically the \"bad guys\". It portrays them in a way that makes you feel that they are just like your family, they just happen to kill people for a living. They were all dynamic and interesting, and you couldn't really just classify them as the good or bad guy. Filming/technicalities: Their lighting was the one thing that I actually noticed about the technical aspect. They always had innocent events out in broad daylight, but when a bad guy came on, or something dark was going on, it was almost always concealed in the shadows. Normally I don't really care about those types of things, but it gave the movie a nice effect.", "Absolutely Powetful !! but not the best of all-time": "I'm not a big fan of this masterpiece but I liked almost everything in it, I starting to love it though .. 1st time I've seen it I didn't really like it then re-watched it twice then really released how great this movie is .. one of the problems I had before seeing it that people told me almost daily how great it is and they speak with details sometimes which I believe is a big mistake because they really made feel that like if a miracle is going to happen and change the world as we know while I'm watching it!! besides, the biggest pleasure is to discover all the great things yourself so you can actually feel the greatness instead of faking it or something even if it takes you more than five times to watch it.. just be patient and try to see it as q movie and while you are watching someday you will know for sure how and why it is so great. In my opinion it is great because of Marlon Brando who gave one of the best performances in history of cinema .. the rest of the cast especially Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire did a great job .. Coppola did a great job directing and writing it with Mario Puzo and the music couldn't just be better .. the movie is great but it has also its down points .. so, I doubt it is the best movie of all-time. Enjoy it.", "Didn\u00b4t like very much": "A bad movie, just lots of conversation for 3 hours, and little action.", "Beautiful colors, script, character chemistry, and acting": "\"The Godfather\" is one of those movies that everyone has heard of, everyone knows scenes of, and is quoted, parodied, and paralleled in everything from major movies to children's cartoons.  There's the raspy voice of Don Corleone, the bloody horse's head in bed, and the actors for which the film defined their careers (Robert Duvall, Al Pacino that make this film).  All of these things make this film a unique addition to American cinema and a classic to remember for years.  The plot follows the trail of the Corleone family for several years after the assassination attempt of the family patriarch, Don Corleone (Marlon Brando).  After the Don is unsuccessfully gunned down by five shots from rival's gang, his son Michael (Al Pacino) is forced to take over through a series of unfortunate events.  One of the beautifully tragic events in this movie is Michael's transition from naive to a mob leader in his father's name.  This movie has it all-action, drama, love, beauty, and politics.  It is a must-see of American Film and a institution for mafia films and will be for years to come.", "Extremely overrated film": "I watched this film when I was a kid, then as a teenager, then twice as an adult. I watch a lot of classic films, foreign and domestic (US), and I am very open minded in my movie selection. Apart from the music score and somber and tragic mood in the film, I find tp be it very unappealing. The cinematography is wonderful, no doubt, but the story telling, script, and acting as mediocre. Marlon Brando's acting has always been overrated, I always heard Marlon Brando, this, Marlon Brando that, I saw 5 of his films and I never watched others. HE's got to be one of the worst actors that ever set foot on a set. Al Pacino acts like he is running on a 2 volt battery in this movie, and they're supposed to be Italians right? Mafia or otherwise Italians do not behave as they do in this movie, and this causes the film to lose credibility. Al Pacino is an amazing actor, my favorite, but in this movie he is mediocre. The Godfather is a great story but the film fails to glue me to the TV. Huge cast, wonderful music and cinematography, what a waste of talent.", "One of the most touching movies of all time": "I must say that I did not like Godfather when i saw it for the first time. This may have something to do with the fact that i was 10 years old and loved Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies. I watched it again when i was 17 and i was blown away by the beauty (and tragedy) of the movie.I can understand why everyone does not enjoy Godfather. It is quite slow paced and does not necessarily appeal to a viewer who is used to gangster movies with lot of action in them, movies with 'dramatic' Hollywood soundtrack and movies that have quick 'dramatic' plot twists.First of all, you must remember that this is is not a gangster movie. This is a movie about family. This is movie about responsibilities. So if you are waiting to see Scarface then you are in for a big disappointment.Best part of the movie is the story. Movie tells us tale of the youngest son of the American-Sicilian mafia family. Tale of the son who has decided to live his life by the laws of the united states and not have anything to do with businesses of his family. But through the tragedy that brings the whole family together, son is little by little drawn back to illegal side of family. Finally son becomes what he did not want to be. What he despised. Because of the responsibilities to the family he forgets his ambitions and plans and becomes the Godfather.Coppola has really got the best performance out of the actors in this movie. Every emotion of Michael and other characters is forwarded to viewer. Special mention to the cast of this movie. I have not seen a movie with better casting. Cinematography of the movie may be a little out of date but it still is really really beautiful. Especially beautiful sets in Sicily deserve a mention. Nino Rota's soundtrack supports the drama of the movie in a way that I can hardly think of the soundtrack that does this better.All in all, i love this movie. If you combine first two films, you get the classical story of man changing to what he does not want to be. Classical story about rise and the fall of the man who turns from kind and loving person to ambitious, greedy and paranoid leader who pushes all his loved ones away. Story not too far from another one of the greatest movies of all time. Story not too far from Citizen Kane.And oh yes. I will dance Speak softly love in my wedding next august.", "One Of The Best Films Of All Time": "When one thinks of film masterpiece, \"The Godfather\" is certainly high on the list. I wish my review could have been written in 1972, but today will have to do. Rightly labeled, \"Godfather\" is in the top ten ultimate guy movies of all time. In many circles it is required viewing before labeling yourself a man.Mario Puzo and Coppola have crafted Americana organized crime mythology. The Godfather story has weaved it's way into society slang, catch phrases and the average person's basic knowledge of the mafia. No matter the other roles the actors in this film bring to life in other great movies, they are never praised so much or remembered so deeply as for \"The Godfather.\"Names of acting royalty such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and more are involved in the \"Godfather\" franchise. The movie, the dialogue, the cinematography are as fresh today as in 1972. Pacino's portrayal of the character of Michael Corleone is film school homework. The appearance of Brando as Don Corleone not only revamped his career but is now a staple for what the head of a mafia family must be like.Voted in the top ten films of all time by the American Film Institute, \"The Godfather\" is a must see film. Lucky for new film goers and fans alike, the movie is so popular you can catch it on television about once a week. The entire \"Godfather\" trilogy fills the cable airwaves keeping the movie very much in the public eye. If you haven't seen it, but like movies then by all means check your listings.

I really like the wedding scene that takes place in the first 25 minutes. This sequence took a week to shoot and involved 750 extras!Marlon Brando plays Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family. No one plays this role better than he does. He gives a powerful performance. Al Pacino is Michael, who takes over after Sonny(James Caan) is gunned down at a toll booth. Sonny was in line to be the next don.Overall, this film is a good film-but how can it be no. 1 in the top 250 list? This list is determined by the votes people give, but it's not the best movie ever made. Citizen Kane is IMHO.This film is part of the \"Godfather\" DVD collection. There is also a bonus disc with bonus materials. On it it tells you more than you ever wanted to know about all three films. It took me about 4-5 hours to watch all this including looking at the photo galleries.It's my understanding that all 3 movies will be released separately-but the only feature that they will contain is the commentaries by the director. Get the DVD collection if you want other bonus stuff.", "good movie": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.", "This is an offer you cant refuse!": "I loved this movie.

I honestly cannot say who does better in this movie Brando's character is one for the ages, Pacino is so convincing it gives me chills, Cahn's character is played so well you cant even explain why you like the guy so much, and Duvall is magnificent as the cool under fire lawyer.

There are the obvious reasons for liking this film - firstly the plot is wonderful - how one thing leads on to another.Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were electrifying as Vito and Michael but in my opinion the star of the show was James Caan as Sonny - he is probably the most memorably brilliant character ever, also turning excellent performances were the superb but terribly underrated John Cazale as Fredo - The disregarded brother (he would shine trough in part 2) and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.The most memorable scene in my mind if where Sonny gives his brother in law Carlo a slight beating with a dustbin lid.;A true classic and JUST better than the sequel", "Classic film, immortal work": "The film tells the story of how Michael, the youngest son of Godfather Don Corleone, became the new godfather, and portrays the fictional New York Mafia in the novel as a family struggle to realize the American dream.

I concede that The Godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls I'm not so sure. And when I say not sure I mean Definitely not! I also admit that I'm not a Brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldn't matter if I like Brando or not, I should still like the film right?, and I just don't. My dad is the biggest Brando fan and even he doesn't reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon. In my opinion Carlito's Way or The Untouchables are far superior 'films'of the genre. I think the main problem I have with The Godfather other then the never ending dullness of it, is that it always seems to be saying 'oh look isn't cool to be in the mob, we should all do it'. Of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met, rather then being the message of the film. Not my cup of tea at all I'm afraid.", "What it means to be a man": "Probably one of the most masculine films ever made, at times perhaps dull for today's standards but an absolute masterpiece nonetheless.

It treats it as necessary evil, but also shows that even the good people in society can easily be corrupted by its power (this is more relevant in the film's fantastic sequel).\nIf you haven't seen this film yet then watch it. You'll either love it or think it's overrated but you still won't regret the experience", "A true Hollywood classic!!!": "Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" is an excellent, epic story in the life of an organized crime family.  Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, the head of the family, with such brilliance that we forget \"it is Brando who is portraying Vito!\"  As the film progresses, Vito is critically wounded in a mob hit. Eventually, his son, Michael (Al Pacino), assumes control of the family business.  The movie is so authentic in how it relates to the mafia that we, as the viewer, feel as if we are eavesdropping into the lives of a \"real\" mob family.  The film made stars of Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan. Francis Coppola directs magnificently and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece.", "THE GODFATHER (1972) - 16/10/2019": "From it's stellar opening wedding scene to it's bittersweet conclusion, The Godfather is a groundbreaking and brilliantly made film that deals with themes of power, corruption and family with subtly and finesse. Easily one of the greatest movies ever made.Mitchell Bulfin", "One Of The Best Masterpiece": "One realizes the importance of movies after watching this movie.Though paced slow , yet misses nothing. The movie tells the story not just of a mafioso but also of one of the strongest and most stable characters created -The GODFATHER. One of the most remarkable part of the movie is Al Pacino's acting. In the beginning he is a very cute person and you don't see any vice in him.Now, when things go bad for him ,you see him changing ,his eyes becoming dangerous.By the end of the movie he is entirely somebody else -The next GODFATHER. The theme music has a touch of negativity in it to depict the dark side of the Godfather but the Sicilian part has very soothing music also. The only drawback(if at all it is) is the pace of the movie which might seem slow compared to these days movie with so many cuts and pacing music,but if you have the patience to watch it, only then will you realize how great the movie is.", "BORING AND SLOW": "I can't understand how people can enjoy this movie when it's so slow and still. I couldn't even stand the first 20 minutes. The atmosphere is all too quiet and it's all just people talking. A lot of people would rate this movie 10/10 and think they're intelligent or something.", "Tad too violent. Not my taste.": "This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance.Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself.The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made but too violent and not enough of the evil of man in it.", "a gem of film history": "this is one of the greatest films ever made. Hands down. If you like movies and have yet to see this film. See it you will not be disappointed. The film has a little something for everyone in it. It follows the book The Godfather by Mario Puzzo. Basically, it is about Don Vito Corelone retiring as head of the family business and handing it to his son Michael. This movie is definitely at the top of my list. It is my favorite of the trilogy with Part 3 in a close second. Every part of this film is perfect. From the acting to the technical aspect. The AFI ranked this movie somewhere in the top five or ten films ever made.

Anyone seeing them for the first time should introduce themselves to the theatrical versions (Part III is good - the Vatican sequences are brilliant - but it's just not in the same league; many scenes were just recaps of what we saw [better] in I & II) ( PART II also recaps some scenes from the original, but they were presented on the \"flipside\" - and it worked).Now a very positive gripe: \"The Godfather: A Novel for Television\" was first broadcast in 1977, it has recently resurfaced on some cable channels (covers I & II in chronological order and retitled The Godfather Saga). What's frustrating is that now, no matter what version I see, I can't help feeling I'm watching an abridged film. For 99.9% of all films, who would care; but this is storytelling at its finest. PART II was innovative for its prequel/sequel presentation that shows (SUBTLE SPOILERS) the irony of the rise and fall of a powerful crime dynasty. But now (I know I'm not alone) after seeing the outakes inserted where they should be, this has made the viewing so much more enriching, especially if you've read Mario Puzo's novel. The problem is that not only is the saga censored (reasonable enough for TV fare), but they've trimmed some lines of dialogue from the theatrical version (I'm not talking about lines containing profanity) apparently for time constraint. What makes the theatrical version more difficult to enjoy now is that the outakes are better pieces of filmaking than 90% of the movies out there (I knew this gripe would turn into a compliment). And in putting it in chronological order, the irony is lessened, but in no way is it lost. The viewer is allowed to see an American tragedy unfold.I did tape a local broadcast of the \"saga\" in 1988 and again on AMC recently and both versions of THOSE have little scenes that the other doesn't have. EXAMPLE: At the end of Godfather, the scene fades to black (1955), then fades up to show Michael Corleone (now in 1958) walking along his Nevada lakeside estate in the wee hours of the morning of his son's communion/celebration. It's a well done transition scene that's in the 88' telecast, but not in the recent ones (from a fade to black, it almost jump cuts to the party and Fredo's entrance with wife Deanna). Even the bonus disc of the DVD that contains deleted scenes (separate from the films) don't contain all of them. Just one example is (from Godfather I), the first scene that introduces Don Corleone, after the undertaker Bonasera exits the Don's study, Sonny is sternly chastised by the Don for not paying attention (that was worth seeing just to hear Marlon Brando whistle). It's duration is only about 10 seconds long, but it cements the fact that Sonny is the intended Don in training who still needs tweaking by his father.This is damn fine filmmaking that captures the texture and atmosphere of the time told in the story; be it early 1900's, mid 40's thru the late 50's and Coppola successfully borrowed from the styles of moviemaking, styles lifted from the 20's, 40's and 50's. Movies over 50 years ago didn't have fancy subjective camera moves and Coppola's decision to film using old fashion techniques makes you feel you're watching a film from that time era (I realize this was early 70's, but new wave style and zip zooms had been around for 10 years[?] ).I'm confident that hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of movie lovers would immerse themselves in a longer UNCUT version that is no longer constrained by theatrical time factors. 7 hours and 15 minutes (not including end credits and no Part III) would be impossible in a theater, but this is the age of home entertainment (still can't beat watching a movie in the theater) that allows freedom AND a stop button (2 or 3 well placed intermissions would be better). That means you're saddled with more footage of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...ect giving us some of the finest performances in their careers. Any complaints about that?? Special mention to all but especially James Caan who lost so much footage to the cutting room floor. During the 2nd act of the Godfather, James Caan and Al Pacino are the stars of the movie as the story flips back and forth between the two; after all Sonny is the heir apparent. To show how instrumental he was to the family by exposing his leadership ability and softer side made what follows that much more shocking.No, I didn't buy the DVD (I did rent the bonus disc) for these reasons. I'll wait till they reconstruct the saga on a new DVD edition(if rumors are true) but please...no Part III.(Subtle Spoiler) Note: Never was comfortable when Godfather PART II changed Vito's birthday from April 28,1887 (The Godfather -cemetery monument) to 1892 (from the opening \"In 1901 the godfather was born Vito...he was nine years old!) Marlon Brando's closing scenes led you to believe the 1887 birthdate.Francis Coppola is an artistic genius, he's never made up his mind to stop tinkering with editing the saga. Even the Godfather Epic 1902-1959 contained only some deleted scene and excised 2 or 3 scenes from the theatrical version.

Opportunists may triumph, but we will preserve HIS spirit in our minds, amen.If you go through the list of reviewers who love this movie and, if you listen to your friends who rave about its greatness, you'll find a not so astonishing leitmotif. They are almost all men. These men see \"The Godfather\" as symbolic of something. It's something sort of mystical, just like the rituals of the Catholic Church\u0096gun smoke and incense. It has to do with the right of fatherly place, something which is being lost as time has marched on, ever onwards towards an oblivion of irrelevance for patriarchy, the family, private property and the State itself! We mourn the loss. We are nostalgic for these good old days. This is a tragedy. But, buck up, me buckos. It's also reality. You know that. That's what's so good about \"The Godfather\". It's REAL, baby! Don Vito Corleone is right to recognize that the potential violence embodied in HIM, the patriarch of the ruling family and his/its gang of servant/employees gives him the power to dispense justice. Kiss his hand. Lick it. He is Papa, you guinea. Justice\u0096what an abstraction, all filled with nicety-nice images of doing good unto others as you would have them do unto you. Pure crapola!

Michael: So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1000. Kay: How'd he do that? Michael: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay: What was that? Luca Brasi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his brains, or his signature, would be on the contract. That's a true story. That's my family, Kay, it's not me. It's only the women-units, like Kay Adams who are confused and who need to be reminded, every once in a while. Kay ventures to open her mouth about politics and her naive liberalism is met with a quick back fist of REALITY by Michael Corleone, (who art her husband and budding patriarch in his own right, amen).MC: My father is no different than any other powerful man -- any man who's responsible for other people, like a senator or president. KAY: You know how naive you sound...senators and presidents don't have men killed. MC: Oh, who's being naive, Kay? That's it girls and the rest of you liberals and socialists. The richest one percent of the families in the USA own more of the well, no, I mean wealth, than the other ninety-percent of American families. For this, they get the best government money can buy. And, if someone stands in their way with some left-leaning line, well we know what happens to them.As Barzini says to the other Dons about sharing the spoils from the well of exploitation: Certainly, he can present a bill for such services. After all, we're not Communists. But he must let us draw the water from the well. Get it you softies? This is social darwinism in action, reduced to its simplest formula and ground down to its final solution. This is reality of THE GAME : dominance and submission, master and servant, the Godfather and you.Meanwhile, true women can talk about the kids, especially about the up and coming males. She can cook and clean. This is her place. She knows nothing about the realities of politics. It is a dog-eat-dog world outside of her properly protected areas of concern : with the kids, in the kitchen and at church.Don't get me wrong. This is a great flick. The acting was the best that most of these men ever did or would do. Of course, the women were a bit hollow. But that role fit the script. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was masterful as was his collaboration with Mario Puzo on the screenplay. The cinematography by Gordon Willis was appropriately brown, dark and conservative. The casting by Louis DiGiamio, Andrea Eastman and Fred Roos was near perfect.Brando's last scene in \"The Godfather\" was really the classic moment. But then, there were so many. Anyway, remember? He and his grandson playing in the garden. First Vito sprays the bugs. He pushes the device. Out comes the death spray. Down go the bugs. Then, he gives the push-spray gun to little Michael's son. The cute thing chases his grandfather around spraying insect killer at him like it was some kind of Tommy Gun until, boom, the old ticker gives out and Brando collapses. The kid doesn't know he's dead yet and so steps up to the body and sprays it some more. Rather like the last moments in Sonny's untimely death, no?

The direction is top shelf as was the screenplay. The word that describes it best is \"authentic.\" The entire movie - setting, plot and especially the characters are very authentic feeling.The problem I have with The Godfather is the plot; specifically the ending. Novel readers and movie watchers know that you don't just give the protagonist what he or she wants unopposed. Michael orders a hit on the heads of all five families and Mo Greene at the end while his child is being baptized to get them before they get him? This is not rewarding, I'm sorry.Also, there needs to be more of a twist than simple betrayal by a minor character (Tessio). A betrayal should hit the reader / watcher like a gut punch. What if Kay betrayed her husband? Would he kill her or forgive the mother of his children? What about letting the head of one of the families live so they could fight another day?The most common negative comments I read are about the film being boring, however I don't agree. Godfather isn't boring but the ending, even though dramatic with all the killings, is boringand unsatisfying from a plot perspective.Lastly, structurally it is best to have the protagonist duel it out with the antagonist at the end. Instead, Michael doesn't get his pinky dirty while everyone else gets bloody.So there you have it. Very good film but not excellent. The ending is lazy.Note, I agree with Copolla about the book.

The problem was, the first time I watched it, I had to asked my dad half the time what the hec these guys were talking about or who was killing who'. But the second time I watched it, I understood every word and really got into it. Cause, it's a classic and I'm that kind of person who loves to watch some of those great old films like On the Waterfront or the French Connection. And the The Godfather wasn't like any of them. The story was amazing and god forbid the fantastic dialogue but I think that the film's strong point is the acting. Well, when you've got Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall attached to a movie then you kind of already know it's gonna be amazing. And it was. Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for playing the extremely iconic role of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan all deserved there nominations as well.

Least he won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay with Mario Puzo. I own the book The Godfather by Mario Puzo and I read some of it and it is good. This movie is one of the best movies ever made well maybe the exception of Pulp Fiction.", "When Capitalism Beckoned Communism With a Dash of Olive Oil!": "This movie could easily be pitched as the most landmark creation in cinematographic history for setting the tone of Social Education in the coming years, given serious cosmetic evolution was just on the cards and more than ever, money just had to sit in the right hands to make social sense. While the thirst for bona-fide business ventures has been ripe within mankind for the longest time, it is just a badly kept secret that suckers for reputation almost always fall back on triads and godfathers to save their skin from the vengeance of their hitherto ignorant audience suddenly awaken from their poverty induced deep sleep when outsiders take notice of their insouciance and insiders take notice of their pride. Made at the dawn of the fall of the family as a mega-institution, it insinuates that the appeal in gangsters never lay in the fashion or the thrust but in the starkly bare realisation imperative in their context that money finds you only when have people around you to call family, for what needs to find you needs a road to find you, and the homeless never ever had it easy in times of war and in times of peace! If that's too much of a lesson, Marlon Brando's otherworldly performance is just pure, uncorrupted education in theatre.", "best movie": "This is best movie in my life. Acting and Actrors amazing. I wish I am in this movie . Marlon Brando my favorite actor", "Legend": "Best Movie Ever i ever seen al pacino so much talnted", "Most accomplished US film": "This epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day America's\u00a0 most accomplished feature film. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the storyline's elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time. What makes it so enormously appealing and deeply satisfying is Copolla's masterful direction. Every frame is constructed in such an ingenious manner, that if taken out of context and hung up on a wall as a painting, it would take up another value, becoming as work of art in and of itself. Indeed, it is tempting to compare the dark indoor compositions (the mise-en-scenes' arrangement especially) to Rembrandt and other Dutch masters, without exaggeration. The staging of each scene is handled with the kind of technical and spiritual balance advocated only in Eastern religions: no extreme close-ups, no jittery or stale camera movements. On a visual level, \"The Godfather\" possesses an ethereal beauty regardless of content. The picture's other aspects reveal an astounding proximity to irrefutable perfection: an immortal original score with at least three distinguished motifs; the superlative acting by all of the Corleone Mafia clan and their enemies; the compelling plot which swiftly unfolds before us through, among other things, the most riveting montage since \"Battleship Potemkin\", no less. Even its minute details are widely quoted today: what comes most easily to mind is the shot-by-shot parody of Brando's botched assassination in '99's \"Analyze This\", and the more obscure slang term : \"to pull a Fredo\", coined\u00a0 in \"Swingers\" (one of the 90's hippest comedies). Just to decipher the later (decidedly dirty) reference should be a good excuse to watch \"The Godfather\" yet again.", "Perfect Movie": "In \"The Godfather,\" we have the New York-New Jersey world, ruled by five \"families,\" one of them headed by Brando. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short.In makeup and physical movement instantly evocative of Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane in \"Citizen Kane,\" Brando does an admirable job as the lord of his domain. He is not on screen for much of the film, though his presence hovers over all of it.It is Pacino, last seen (by too few) in \"Panic In Needle Park,\" who makes the smash impression here. Initially seen as the son whom Brando wanted to go more or less straight (while son James Caan was to become part of the organization), Pacino matures under the trauma of an assassination attempt on Brando, his own double-murder revenge for that on corrupt cop Sterling Hayden and rival gangster Al Lettieri, the counter-vengeance murder of his Sicilian bride, and a series of other personnel readjustments which at fade out find him king of his own mob.In a lengthy novel filled with many characters interacting over a period of time, readers may digest the passing parade in convenient sittings. But in a film, the audience is forced to get it all at one time. Thus it is incumbent on filmmakers to isolate, heighten and emphasize for clarity the handful of key characters; some of that has been done here, and some of it hasn't. The biggest achievement here is the establishment of mood and time.Among the notable performances are Robert Duvall as Hagen, the non- Italian number-two man finally stripped of authority after long years of service; Richard Castellano as a loyal follower; John Marley as a Hollywood film mogul pressured into giving a comeback film role in a war film to Al Martino, an aging teenage idol; Richard Conte as one of Brando's malevolent rivals; Diane Keaton as Pacino's early sweetheart, later second wife; Abe Vigoda as an eventual traitor to Pacino; Talia Shire as Brando's daughter, married to a weak and traitorous husband Gianni Russo; John Cazale, another son who moved to Las Vegas when that area attracted the mob, including Alex Rocco as another recognizable character; Morgana King as Brando's wife; and Lenny Montana as a mobster.Nino Rota's fine score, plus several familiar pop tunes of the period, further enhance the mood, and all the numerous technical production credits are excellent. So, at the bottom line, the film has a lot of terrific mood, one great performance by Pacino, an excellent character segue by Brando, and a strong supporting cast. That will be enough for some, only half the job for others.Murf.", "An unparalleled masterpiece": "Many reviews talk about the genius evidenced in this masterpiece of \"gangster\" movies. Of course, it really is a family movie, with a story set in the gangster world. What can I add that has not been said already? The simple fact that this classic captures the family dynamic that is practically gone from movies of the last 20 years.The movie does not drown in schmaltz or sappy emotion. The love of the sons for the Godfather is natural and understandable. We can all identify with loving someone so much that we would be willing to die for them, or worse. The togetherness as well as the personal prejudices of the Corleone family (esp. Sonny) make the dynamic totally believable.I loved this movie, and I can watch it over and over. In fact, I think I will!", "best film": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.", "top 5!": "This is the definitive film! One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece.", "Breathtaking although not the greatest mob film": "This movie had me speechless by the end. In this movies there are no errors,no mistakes, everything is perfection. It is perfect in every aspect of the movie. It boosted Pacino to stardom along with a Dog Day Afternoon. It is Francis Ford Copollas greatest classic alongside Apocalypse now. This movie has a great story line and shows what its really like to be in a mob family down to the very last detail. No part of this movie is wrong and the views of the mob are correctly viewed. This movie is an all-time classic. I would not consider it the greatest mobster movie as i feel Good Fellas is but it is perfect and could not have been done better by a perfect director. I give this movie an amazing 10 out of 10.", "The Best of All Time": "It's remarkable how a film 30 years old can still amaze even teens (I'm 17, you know). It has an incredible script and its filming is just perfect. It doesn't have any flaw, and probably the best highlight is its cast with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. etc. etc., all of them shine thru the movie and make this (too) long film most enjoyable despite the extreme length. With two worth viewing sequels (specially Godfather II with the majestic Robert De Niro), The Godfather is best saga in history of movies, much, but much more than Star Wars. The one and only classic in movie history, the best of all times that can never be beaten.", "An immortal cinematic masterpiece in the history of cinema": "Coppola's immortal cinematic masterpiece in the history of cinema, the greatest cinematic film, has an impact in the world of films.

That said, not all books cross to film well. This is one such instance, in my opinion. Beyond the faithful recreations of some classic scenes, I don't see what there is to like. I'm sure some people say they just like it because it's popular.", "Gangster Masterpiece": "The perfect gangstser movie, so original and creative, great acting great dialogues, never boring. 10/10", "I cried. Definite Spoilers.": "MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER (that is the full name of the film) is haunting, gothic, thought-provoking and an excellent sociological study. On the surface, this is a story about organized crime, loyalty, and family. On the subsurface, Coppola weaves brilliant themes about parallel identities and the profound influence of example. In essence, THE GODFATHER isn't a gangster film; it is too intricate and genuine of a film to be characterized as simply a `gangster film'. Much of the importance of the movie lies in the actual character of the Godfather. Marlon Brando's Godfather seems to represent an individual who is world-weary, but yet, not disillusioned to the point of extending loyalty to others. We look at THE GODFATHER from the standpoint of an individual on the outside looking in. Even though the opening scenes take place in the midst of a wedding, this is a closed society to us. Criminals and cold-blooded killers dance, sing, and play with all the innocence of children. And yet, we want to be close to many of these people once the movie ends. When an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera asks the Godfather to perform a service for him the patriarch reminds him of the fact that Bonasera never \"wanted his friendship\" and that he couldn't remember the last time he was invited over for a \"cup of coffee\". We may relate to the many times that we, like Don Corleone, extended our friendship and loyalty to others but never got it in return. I know too many people that are more concerned with having someone else do something for them than returning any sort of favor. It's amazing that as powerful of a figure the Godfather is, he also looks at the small acts that characterize friendship. I began to relate to him so much I began to wish that all fathers could retain many of the beautiful characteristics that this man possesses. This is not to deify the character lead of Coppola's film. After all, the Godfather is a criminal. And yet, when he dies in the film, it's as if the World has suffered a great loss. I actually cried during this scene the first time I saw it when I was a kid. It is interesting to note that we are not supposed to respect the criminal organization in this film. After all, the extent to which a person is protected in the Don's extended criminal family is often related to the extent to which a character is willing to shed blood. A good member must be willing to break the law and deny one's friends but never their family. In essence, the movie is filled with paradoxes (not in plot, but in the characters themselves). We see a grandfatherly figure that pulls the strings of a criminal organization. We witness the transformation of the good son to the calculating killer. We see benevolence in many of the supporting characters that are willing to kill. THE GODFATHER is a movie that is more complicated and intricate than people are willing to admit. As a result, at our access is one of the most fascinating character studies.", "A cult classic and the best picture in film industry has ever seen": "Just a pure masterclass of film making, the quran , bible and the gita of film making, it was my second time watching, this is the film which was inspired my many \u2728\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 i ll just note down the movies which inspired many directors atleast to take a scene from this plot they were vadachennai, nayagan, Chekka chivandha vaanam, pudhupettai and all these were a cult classic in tamil industry which was inspired this masterpiece , u will see how bigger and cult will be of this film \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 a tru true cult classic so honest and intense in screenplay and the story oh boy we will be living in it , the don corleone family will be in front every frame just a pure magic this director did it all right \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 brando oh boy his acting sure won him an oscar and Al pacino and all the crews just nailed every scene of it \u2728\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 pls doo watch available in prime , this was my 2nd time and i reccommend you to do soo as well\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u2728\u2728\u2b50its been 50 years but the movie is as gold as new \ud83d\udd25\u2728", "Respect the craft but it's overrated and I hate it": "Technically there's a lot in this movie that looks appealing, it's competently produced in many, many ways. But I hate every character in it with a burning passion and just want every single one arrested and sentenced to hard labor post-haste; their concerns in the movie are of absolutely zero concern to me as a viewer and every moment spent on their stories feels like a waste of my time. It doesn't help it's hard to hear a lot of the dialogue and it just rambles on and on and on and I literally CANNOT keep my brain tuned into what they say in this film. I have never finished this film because it is impossible for me to stay tuned into it and/or stay awake, and I love lots of long, slow films! It's also not like I'm opposed to gangster films; Casino, Miller's Crossing, and Road To Perdition are ranked very, very, very high in my list of all-time favorite movies. The fact that this remains at or near the top of the IMDb ranking is proof positive that groupthink is alive and well amongst the movie reviewers. I would literally rank 1000 other movies I've seen above this, including many so-called \"bad\" movies because they're genuinely entertaining and The Godfather is pointless time-wasting misery.", "A Movie You Can't Refuse": "The world works differently in 1940's New York City, especially if you were a Sicilian. The Godfather, in all its twists and turns that coincide with the style of living in the mafia, sets itself aside from all other gangster/mob/mafia movies by providing a transformation unlike any other. This change, however, comes from an individual that you, as a watcher, wouldn't want it to come from, until you do. The hook is in the constant re-occurrence of the meaning of loyalty to an Italian.Advice for first time viewers: watch with someone who has seen it before, because you will get lost at some points and will need the legal and mafia jargon explained.", "the best in my opinion": "the godfather does what it does at it's finest, memorable moments,characters and situations. all the actors made the best they could and more, interesting plot and mix it with some drama-crime you have a master piece, glorious and epic in mafia movies and one of the best if not the best movie ever made, Francis ford made the best crime drama movie till date and alpacino made the godfather even better with his acting and role, the moment that stick's out is \u00a8\"ill make him an offer he can't refuse\" it is just a small line but epic if you understand it and know what could happen because he is the godfather and he is the mafia leader and he does a fine job at doing so. 10/10 godfather approves", "I am the godfather": "Yesterday gave up another couple hours from my time deciding that I was going to rewatch the godfather. Last time my mistake I was on my phone. So I thought the The movie was confusing boring. But after I rewatched this it was insane. The plot is amazing it's it's so good Show Invested for 3 hours. The fact that it was the person getting married at the start who killed the brother was insane. The screenplay of this movie was insane the way it was written I think this has gotta be one of my favorite movies. I think that it's gonna be hard to top. And the fact that Michael At the start didn't want to be involved in the mafia and then laid on he decides I'm going to get this a shot in And he makes some bold moves and I definitely think hes seen it turn on the family I eventually could stay triumphant on him. Now I took it from my favorite part of the film he acting from al pachino It's sorted good and When I looked at the godfather part Too I saw a al pachino. So I definitely think it's one of my favourites.", "Should have left it alone.": "This movie is a masterpiece. They should have left it alone. Everyone talks bad about the 3rd; but the 2nd was to the 1st, what the 3rd was to the 2nd.", "This is a curious film": "It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great.It's excellent in arts - design, cinematography, editing, and music.", "Deserving its regard as one of the best films of all time": "There are so many reasons why this is a great film: unforgettable music (especially that theme that adapts itself to so many different moods), striking cinematography, strong pacing, but first and foremost are the performances. The entire cast shines; no wonder so many of them--mostly unknowns at the time, like Pacino, Duvall, Keaton, and Caan--went on to stellar careers. But two performances stand out: Brando's and Pacino's.\nDon Corleone is, in reality, little more than a well-dressed thug. But Brando infuses the Don with a regal manner: he carries himself like a king and speaks in dignified cadences. He dispenses vengeance and vice, but calls them justice and business. Even that infamous mumbling adds to the effect--it makes everyone (including the audience) lean forward, in respectful silence, to hear this powerful man speak. We should despise Corleone, but Brando's charisma in the role--arguably his best in a remarkable career--wins us over.It's Pacino, however, who carries the bulk of the film, along with our sympathy. He is, we are led to believe, the hero of the story: when Michael first appears, he's outside in the light, whereas the Don first appeared in a dark, shaded lair. He's in love with a woman from a brighter world (it's no coincidence Diane Keaton's hair was coloured blonde for this movie), and assures her that he's not like the rest of his family. We want the best for him: we hope he'll escape his family's unsavory business.But gradually, Michael gets drawn into those dark rooms his father inhabits. Pacino masterfully portrays a character who tries to be a hero, who tries to defend or avenge those he loves, but loses himself in the process. By the end of the film, Michael Corleone is positively reptillian--cold-blooded, predatory, calculating, a creature without remorse or morality. He has gained the world but lost his soul. Normally, we would regard a man like Michael Corleone from afar with a mixture of revulsion and fear. We would think him inhuman, refusing to recognize anything of ourselves in him. But Coppola makes us identify with Michael, sympathize with him. If he's become a monster by the end of the film, we've been forced to recognize that we, too, could become monsters in the right (or wrong) circumstances. We have stared into the abyss, and found that it contains a dark, distorted reflection.With The Godfather, Coppola et al took rather base source material--a pulp crime novel--and elevated it to the realm of Shakespearean tragedy. This is great story-telling, great movie-making, and great art. 10/10.", "A Must for anyone who has ever watch any movie...": "Godfather needs no introduction as the name says it all. This movie in fact is godfather to all film makers and movie lovers. Right from the opening scene to the last scene, every scene is perfectly craved to make the movie the most perfect movie of all time and it well deserves all the awards it has got. I found Godfather very boring when I watched it first time as i was little and naive and needed more over do of everything in movies i watch. I watched it again some years later and i found it likable and hence with every re-watching i fell more in love with film and i started to notice the genius in it. The acting, the script, the music, the characters, the story, the screenplay, costumes, art, direction everything is just near perfect. Anyone who lived after 1972 has no chance of missing this magnum opus. We will be eternally grateful to Coppola for this masterpiece. A brave 10 on 10.", "Very good, but not #1.": "Like Citizen Kane, the Godfather is extremely influential, but more than a bit overrated. Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather.\nHaving said that, this cast (Fred Roos is the greatest casting director ever) and crew might be the best group of talent ever assembled for one film.  They went on to make some of the greatest films of their generation both in front of, and behind the camera. If you don't believe me, just check their individual credits.", "unbelievable": "This movie is unbelievable. Now we are almost in 2005 years.But i think the best movie in the world maybe in space is GODFATHER-I. Because we cant see in the other films such this type of acting.In godfather you can join film, smell the places, live their feels,and you can judge the same behaves like godfather. For movies The most importing is Music. And i think music of godfather is the best soundtrack. So it makes a wonderful connection for the film. The musics are having get excited the audiences. These are enough for being best movie in the world. Viva Godfather!!!!!!!My all opinion is this. Sorry for not obeying this rule!!Please note there is a 1,000 word limit on comments.

It shows audiences what it is like to kill, as well as why someone might do it. Everyone should watch this movie at some point in their lives.", "An Absolute Work Of Art!": "The Godfather (1972) is a Classic Crime Drama about an organized crime dynasty ran by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Bando and his goals to pass down the family business to his reluctant son, Michael played by Al Pacino. This feature has aged so incredibly well that you won't even feel like you are watching a movie from the 70s. The Godfather is a beautiful work of art. The acting in the film, the detailed and complex plot, and the editing are among the highlights of the movie.The acting is magnificent and will have you quoting the main characters for the rest of the week. The movie begins with Don Vito Corleone in his office during his daughter's wedding. One of the first things that you will notice is that Don Vito has a very strong accent which suggests his character was not born in America. He is a strong man with strengths and weaknesses which he is able to convey from the beginning.The plot is amazing. Although this film is over 3 hours long, there are no dull or boring parts. The dialogue is short and sweet and to the point. There are definitely some moments that had me screaming at the TV and some other moments that made me very sad. Each character has pros and cons which makes them authentic and works to drive the plot into the direction that it is supposed to go.The editing is great. You can tell that the editor really enjoyed and believed in the film because of the scenes that he chose and where he placed them. This movie follows a chronological order so that you can easily follow along with the plot and there are not any scenes that I think should not have been included. Unlike some films where something happens in full detail and then they explain it to another party in full detail, this is not an occurrence in this film.I would recommend anyone who is a fan of crime, dramas, or just classic movies, in general, to give this movie a watch because it was executed to perfection. The movie contains many themes that would not be suitable for children so I would recommend this film for audiences of at least 13, depending on maturity. I tried to come up with criticism for this film, but it proved to be very hard. Never a dull moment, I enjoyed this feature from start to finish. The Godfather does an excellent job of portraying a powerful mob family with many conflicts that the average person will relate to, and some that no normal person could relate to. Watch as the characters struggle with the choice to act violently in order to protect the ones they love, and the choice to make peace with enemies to reduce the likelihood of a war. The acting, the casting, the screenplay, the dialogue and the editing are all excellent and tie the film together into a work of art, an absolute masterpiece!", "Simply spectacular": "Simply brilliant, it tells the sad truth that circulates in some places. This film shows how the mafia works in all its brutality, for a 1977 film it is still a current story. The soundtrack is unforgettable, well composed and goosebumps, the plot is engaging and full of twists, truly a masterpiece. I'll be watching Part 2 and Part 3 shortly and can't wait.", "The Godfather trilogy was a highly successful film": "Especially for his first film which won a myriad of awards such as best film at the Academy Award and Golden Globe in 1973, and Marlon Brando who won best actor thanks to his acting as the Godfather.", "A proper mafia film": "This movie is MORE deserving of the spot held by Shawshank on this site as the best movie of all time. The film was rather concise, leaving the viewer with a desire for more. The main character, bizarre voice aside, was a character that is easy to get attached too, both in part to the well written script, and on point acting. A classic movie everyone should see. I am glad to have a movie in the top 5 that is an example of nearly unanimous support.", "No Brainer: Top Film": "One of the best films ever, The Godfather is such a great gangster drama and representation of cinema.", "Not Perfekt But Close": "What can you say? Coppola got every bit of realism and ability out of the whole cast. They turned themselves inside out. This 3 part saga is definitely in the top 20.", "Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one.": "The gangster film was pretty much the property of Warner Bros during the 1930's. And rightfully so. With their star line-up of Bogart, Edward G., Muni, Raft, O'Brien and the magisterial Cagney , how could they fail?. Public Enemy, the original Scarface, the Roaring 20's, Little Caesar. Even today these films still have a great raw power no matter how certain elements may be dated. And with White Heat Warner proved they could still come up with a truly great gangster film in the late 40's .But when The Godfather came along in 1972 it blew away all the opposition.The hype had really gone into overdrive by the time it reached Ireland in the Summer of 1973. Although it was the film you had to see at the time, for boys of my generation, Marlon Brando was yesterday's man.Clint Eastwood was our idol, with the spaghetti Westerns and Dirty Harry.And, to be honest, the wedding scene, the scene with Brando's pottering around in the garden with his grandson, and the scenes of family banter did seem to me, then, to get in the way of the undoubtedly brilliant set-pieces of violence and pad out the film unnecessarily. Seeing the sequel two years later largely helped me to confirm my original view that the original was more a star vehicle to revive Brando's career and I went along with the perceived opinion that the later film was the masterpiece of the series.Almost 30 years later, having greatly expanded my vocabulary of World Cinema, The Godfather still ranks in my Top 10 of all time,(and I can't see that ranking will ever change) whereas the sequel, while I admire it as a great film, would be some way short.What marks the film out as particularly special include many of the features that I found boring as a teenager: the family relationships; the jostling for positions in the family and mafia hierarchy, but especially the carefully plotted change in Michael's character. Has Pacino ever been better? Like Jack Nicholson, he was at his best in his early films, before the fame thing went to his head. And Coppola undoubtedly kept his performance and character on  a tight rein in contrast to Part 2, where there may just have been a touch of caricature.The great scenes were masterfully directed: the toll-booth assassination; the various violent deaths, Michael's cafe killings; the shocking church murders, but, overall, its the pacing and  development of the film, and Coppola's masterly handling of the actors which will make this one run and run. And I haven't even mentioned Nino Rota's spellbinding music.Of course Coppola has mostly disappointed since then, (although I will always maintain that Rumble Fish is a minor gem, )one acknowledged masterpiece is more than most directors could even dream about.Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one. What higher praise can I give it.", "wow": "one of the most beautiful works of art. Francis Ford Coppola surpassed all the boundaries of old cinema and delivered an innovative vision of the Italian mafia showing us the value of loyalty and the pain of betrayal. we can see an incredible version of Marlon Brando as the Godfather and Al Pacino as the son who is confused and we can see him corrupt himself and accept his destiny.", "Overated": "If you want to see the quintessential american crime film?  Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison.  Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather.  It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the \"earners\" on the street.  He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride.  He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale.Scorcese created goodfellas with passion and respect.  The line between good and evil was blurred, as it is in real life.  The good stories of the mafia dont come from the \"Don\".  They come from the \"earners\".  The guys in the trenches.  They are what keeps the wheel turning.", "Could have been much better.": "I think the movie was okay, but could have accomplished much more.  I, personally, believe that the movie was way too long.  There were a number of scenes and shots which served no purpose to the actual story line that could have been edited out and which made parts of it slow and dull.  I realize that most of these were made for benefit of the director's artistic vision, but art doesn't always make for good story telling -- just look at 2001.", "Greatest movie of all time": "When i watched Godfather for first time, i feel something in my heart. The whole movie is just a masterpiece. The emotion, the drama, everything about this movie is something special. This movie gave to you something you don't find in other movies. Legendary cast.. Marlon Brando which i con sired one of the greatest actor. Al Pacino which also is for me one of the greatest. Great cinematography, maybe one of the best i've ever seen. Francis Ford Coppola maybe isn't greatest director ever but he deserved so much respect for what he did in this movie. How i can got over? The script. Easily one of the best scripts in the history. Storyline is very very good. Godfather is one of few movies when are 100 % focused on what happened next. Personally i feel very shocked when i watch this movie for the first time. For me, there will be no movie like Godfather. Godfather is something you just can't hate. Godfather is the world 8th miracle. Godfather is life. Godfather tells you about life and how you should always love your family. Maybe not a good review for this movie but i cannot find the right words to describe a perfect movie.

It won't make you terrified. It's not romantic either and it won't change your mind on what you already thought about fruits. Yet it can still be a masterfully painted fruit bowl where al the fruits are beautifully portrayed by the artist the way they are. The Godfather is such a movie.Just like most fruit bowl paintings, you wouldn't know if you had to root for the apple or the grapes. And during the entire movie you already know the fruits only have 2 possible outcomes: getting eaten or getting rot. I could go on with my analogy but I think you get the point. (edit: I will go on anyway)Will you like this film?\nWell, some people will stand in front of a perfectly painted fruit bowl for 5 minutes and become utterly bored because of the subject. Others can stand there for days being amazed by the details on the apple, and discovers new perfections every time they are watching the painting.There is no good or wrong here. Everyone has their personal taste. After watching The Godfather you know what kind of person you are. I absolutely do recommend you watch it for yourself. At the end fruit bowl paintings (or other versions of still lives) have become very iconic and appreciated.

The acting is great, the script is good and the directing is OK, but that doesn't make it the best movie ever made. There's almost no foreshadowing in it, there are no major twists in the plot thus making the storyline actually a straight line and there's nothing in the movie that surprises you. When i watched it i was at the edge of boredom and was hoping something would show up in that movie that would pull me back.

Personally, I like GoodFellas a little better. The Godfather has the best of all the qualities for a movie = great directing, great writing (not as good as the book), excellent acting (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall), and all that jazz, but I still don't think it is the best movie ever made.

I'll just write a few lines on the parts of the film I found excellent and very memorable.One of the best little details was the piano tune which kept playing at every tense moment. If you watch the movie for the first time it can fill you up with quite a lot of anxiety (second or third viewing still can't exclude it). The final act was exceedingly memorable and symbolic. We see Michael Corleone and his family at the church during a sacred act, the christening of his niece. Parallel to that event is the killing of the family rivals. This act gives a statement that there is nothing sacred in the world of organized crime. Every promise is broken for the benefit of the family business.It's very hard to find an objective flaw in this film.

I was surprised to find myself engaged with the movie from the very beginning. The magnificent acting, the incredible character development and the variety of different personalities, in combination with the outstanding storytelling, direction, cinematography, atmosphere, music, drew me into this brutal tale about toxic masculinity and life degradation. It's a movie that provoked contradictory feelings to me. The more I watched, the more appalled I felt by what people can turn into once they gain power and at the same time, the more interested I got into the fates of those horrible people. It's quite an irresistible trap masterfully set by super talented actors and creators, that produced iconic moments that linger. To me, there is a certain allure about old cinema, in contradiction to nowadays' fast-food film making. I was quite bothered though, by the little room this long movie left for women's presence. I understand the need to realistically portray the patriarchal life in mafia, where women are treated like props, like merely male successors-generators, but I felt there was a lack in balance, as we only get to see a glimpse of what this life was like for the women involved. Nevertheless, it is a great movie I would actually re-watch.", "Probably the best and most gripping movie made in cinema history!": "In Mario Puzo's the Godfather, the cast of Marlin Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pachino, and Diane Keaton, is unique, and unbelievable. For the 10 rating, I am pretty much speechless. Never, have I ever seen a movie that was put together, in such a realistic, and perfectly graphical way as The Godfather. The way that the movie is outlined, is perfect as well as every other characteristic of the movie. Every actor was perfectly chosen, and uniformed to fit the outline of the movie, and the help the graphics and story-line of the movie become the best ever. Every actor in the movie not only had been chosen perfectly to play in The Godfather, but they were all chosen the perfect spot in the movie. My favorite part, is at the very end of the movie, when Marlin Brando, who was the current Godfather, died, leaving the job to Michael Corleone, his son. It was the perfect ending to lead into the 2nd Godfather, which was equally as good. I highly suggest, that you see them both.

Marlon Brando's performance is impeccable.", "Amazing and Excellent Movie": "This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.", "For me, 'The Godfather' will always be the greatest, dominant Mafia Epic of all time": "\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' is an epic, masterpiece. I mean it IS a forever classic! 'The Godfather' has influenced various films of today, like 'The Departed' and 'Smoking Aces'. Don Vito Corleone represents the true qualities of becoming one of the most established, respected figures in society's minds. Just after the release of the 1972 epic (which achieved 10 Academy Award Nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster films\" were being judged by the style and look of this one, in particular. The strong performances, the director's unique technique and an excellent script, I believe, all play a role in 'The Godfather's' success worldwide. Italian-American director, Francis Ford Coppola introduces every major protagonist with a distinctive, complex individuality. Take Corleone for example, played by Marlon Brando. To me personally, he is seen as the most complicated gangster. He is not a killer, nor does he ever mix business with personal issues. He puts family first and doesn't like any weak people. Brando's performance as Don Corleone won him an Oscar and acknowledged him as one of America's greatest film actors.All men can relate to and understand Corleone's responsibilities of power he permanently has in his family, and how he juggles life as a father figure as well as remaining the boss of his inherited family business.The film opens on the wedding of Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). The wedding scene is a rather good indication, of how the Don's power expands over everyone in his world, from a regular next door neighbour to a killer. His son Michael (Pacino) has just arrived back from the war, in time to see his sister's wedding. Michael is portrayed as the younger, mature and quiet gentleman of the Corleone family. Given the chance as a husband, to take care of his wife, Kay (Keaton), he doesn't intend to become a part of his family's business and just wants to live a normal life. However, being the oldest in his family, gives Michael more responsibilities, which undoubtedly he can't escape from. Being a part of a big family, running a family business, enables Michael to have more family connections. The mise-en-scene and the cinematography are more dark and realistic. Even the sepia tinged colours are reminiscent of the year it is set in. In most Gangster films, the colour black is portrayed as being highly significant and is effectively manipulated in this case. For example; Corleone's main meeting/office room, where he makes all of his decisions: by having Corleone slightly hidden in pitch-black darkness, Coppola immediately creates that sense of enigma, sinister and chilling characteristics to Brando's Corleone. Francis Ford Coppola's themes in 'The Godfather' include family responsibilities, father's inheritance, the need to earn respect and the influence of power. 'The Godfather' is ideally aimed at a wide audience, except children of course; frequent Mafia violence for males, to a light-hearted, romantic tale between couples, for the females. The film effectively plays on the psychological mind, human feelings and emotions, which audiences can still accept and relate to, today.In comparison to other gangster genres, it was the first to introduce the gangster trilogy, with the film's continuous complex narrative that differentiates the importance of family. The representation of Italian ethnicity in 'The Godfather' was also new and innovative, under the conventions of a gangster film. I enjoyed watching this film in particular as well as the others in the three-part gangster saga. The Corleone family story seems so uninterrupted, if watched all together, in one go. I just love how the dialogue, comes out of the characters' mouths so truthfully. I even feel that as a whole, 'The Godfather' proves to be the greatest trilogy in cinema history. I'd have to say with pure, 100% Method Acting performances from both Brando and Pacino; this has got to be on the list of must-see films, without a doubt!", "The Godfather is a classic mafia film.": "The Godfather, with its superb cast, (Brando, Pacino and James Caan) is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Marlon Brando changes his accent from an American to an Italian, which is so amazing.  Pacino is great, especially when potraying Michael, who dreams of going to college when he comes back from the army.  His dreams are shattered when he has to take over for his father, while Brando is in a hospital.  The storyline unfolds from there, and this movie is definetly a classic.", "I liked this movie!!!!!": "If you're wondering why I put exclamation points after the headline, it's because I thought this movie was just another overrated pile of junk. Man was I wrong! This movie was quite good. Sure it isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely in my Top 250! This should definitely replace boring THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as #1 in the Top 250. It's about the Corleone family's criminal empire run by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and trying to pass it on to his son Michael (Al Pacino) You shouldn't watch this movie if you are under age 16 though. It's quite violent and no one under that age would understand it anyway. Definitely watch this movie. It is very well done.8.5/10 or: B", "Incredibly bad": "The first question that came to mind when the \"legendary\" movie finally ended, was this: \"Has everybody gone mad?\". \"The Godfather\" is amazingly bad, start to finish. Al Pacino's talent is wasted in this sorry excuse for a film. No character development, no real plot, no redeeming value whatsoever! Just a bunch of low-life criminals and their self- importance. Fascinating, indeed! There is no real conflict here, and nothing that viewers can relate to. The \"mythical\" figure of Marlon Brando is completely ridiculous. What is it that we're supposed to think is so great about this character? An arrogant murderer who speaks with cotton in his mouth. Big deal! Bad guys are fun when some good guys are there to challenge them. There is no consistency in character development, if there ever was one in the first place. Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from an apparently moral person into a cold-blooded killer? You've got to be kidding... The whole \"family tradition\" is meant to suggest that we're witnessing some kind of royalty saga. All these characters are despicable and one- dimensional, so why would I be interested in anything that happens to them? The level of violence is unacceptable, but I guess that makes for \"edgy\" cinema in the absence of artistic vision.\"The Godfather\" must be the most overrated piece of trash cinema I've ever seen. It is a long, boring, disjointed and pathetic attempt to deliver an uninteresting story.", "\"One of the Best Films of the Decade.\"": "The \"Godfather\" is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings  held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt. BRANDOThe enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the \"Godfather\" of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in \"On The Waterfront.\" He's shockingly effective in a current film, the \"Score.\" The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.THE CAST However, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the \"Godfather\" nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of \"On The Waterfront\", that was a lie. The \"Godfather\" is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.I don't have to recommend this film. I give it a 15 out of 10.", "An Over-rated insignificance that shouldn't be dubbed as 'one of the best'": "I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called \"legendary\" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. Judging from this opening statement I know that these film lovers will aggressively spout out and say that I am 100 percent from about the Godfather... BELIEVE ME when I say that it shouldn't be in the same breath as one of the greatest.Don't get me wrong however, there are a few good qualities which in some way does kind of show some good hallmarks for a good film. The tempo right from the start of the film isn't too bad as it does set a nice tone to the film and kind of signifies what sought of film this will be. In some parts the acting of Marlon Brando as the 'Don' and Al Pacino as Michael do put up good performances which again add's to that verisimilitude to not only the story but to the other characters that are within this film. Although these small film aspects can add to your experience of watching the Godfather, non of this excruciates from the fact that these good factors do have harsh limitations which evidently create more problems throughout the duration of the film.Even though I did say from the start that the tempo and the duration of the scenes and music is perfect in introducing the characters and some of the story aspects, this is all it does unfortunately. As it gets near enough to the middle point of the film, the whole story and tempo falls flat on it's face and in most parts of when they are talking to some other gang leaders does emphasise this point that sometimes in the film, some of the story elements don't really add up to which personal for me creates a lot of boredom. Another sought of example of this is perfectly clear when the character of Michael is in Italy to lay low from the killings that he committed... I find that the Italia sequence is a complete waste of time and primarily add's to this excuse of being nearly a 3 hour film which really it shouldn't be. This sequence just kills the flow and intensity of what will eventually happen; it postpones the inevitable in some fashion. Although again I did say that the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is exceptionally fine, the majority of their performances not only add's to this lack of entertainment, but in a sense just makes me want to never watch this film ever again. Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development.If you want to see a good gangster film then personally I recommend watching 'The Departed' as it does have the same sought of Genre and does everything right in terms of it's interesting story telling between these two men which at times does have lot's of quirky but violent scenes in which is done perfectly right rather than have old men constantly talk non stop about mundane meaningless ideals.I give the Godfather a 7/10Alex Rabbitte", "GOOD": "\"I'll give him an offer he can't refuse.\"\n\"Never let your enemies know what you're thinking.\"\n\"Never hate your enemy.

This movie is laced with iconic scenes, has great pacing and is blessed with great production values throughout. Wow.The bad: Brando is a joke (as he often is).

With Lpachynv The film also good but I think it adds a major reason for the continued presence of the father.Marlo Brando and AL pa chino is the best actor this film . in the end this film is very nice and in before died must watch .", "God Father": "We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of \"The Godfather,\" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.\"The Godfather\" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although \"The Godfather\" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of \"The Godfather\" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so \"The Godfather\" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.", "One of the best movies of all time!!": "The best movie ever, it's a GREAT movie! Marlon Brando gives a great performance as Don Vito Corleone, so does Al Pacino and Robert Duvall, it is the best drama in history, it is a classic! I absolutely loved the story! A Mafia known as the \"Godfather\" who hands over his criminal empire to his son, Micheal (Al Pacino) and things go wrong! Brilliant! SO brilliant! It's very long but very good, Francis Ford Coppola, thank you So much for directing this masterpiece back in the 70s, and bringing the best actors: Pacino and Brando, especially Robert Duvall ! I wish that there were more but to-be-fair, if they brought more, the newer movies would probably be like 1% on Rotten Tomatoes! And also, fun fact: Francis Ford Coppola is still alive and 80 years old right now! It's good to hear that, man!", "The Godfather of them all": "Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest directors of all time,have made many classic movies but i think that it is very difficult to find another movie made by him or by some also great director that can reach the literally unprecedented greatness of this film.This movie is perfect on every aspect:one-of-a-kind direction,superb acting,flawless plot and probably the best soundtrack ever used in a movie.Also the Godfather is a very touching and emotional movie,has a lot to do with the human mourn and the ensuing revenges that never ever end,furthermore it is about human relationships,greed for power,loyalty,devotion and respect.To sum up The Godfather is one of the few and far between true flawless masterpieces of all time and if you want to consider yourself an avid film-watcher,you have to watch it.", "WOW..believe the hype!": "I remember having seen this movie many times when I was a teenager. All my friends swore this movie was great and anyone who didn't see it was missing out. I would watch a little of it here and there in between bouts of reading or napping. I was bored.Fast forward almost 15 years. I am home and this movie is being shown in its entirety. I decide to give it one more try and see if I could understand what all the hype is about. I am glad I did! This movie is about emotions, which fuel every action a human commits. This time, there was no reading, no napping, just me telling my friend to be quiet so I wouldn't miss anything! I realized the movies Hollywood puts out today are awful! I have been watching many \"older\" movies lately and feel as if the viewers are being cheated to a point. There are no \"classics\" being made. People do not have a choice between seeing a mentally stimulating film or a 2 hour fluff film just to escape reality for a little while. There are no performances that match Brando, Caan, Pacino, and Duvall.Marlon Brando was undeniably one of the best actors of the 20th century, even though he made light of his talent and profession. His turn as the Corleone patriarch was absolutely mesmerizing and should be considered some of the finest acting work ever captured on film. Caan's performance as the hotheaded Sonny shows how underrated this actor became. He captured the rage, anger, and disregard for health and life it takes to be a cold-hearted, ruthless \"businessman\". Yet, unlike today's \"gangster\" movies, his actions were glorified because the other side of the coin is taken into account, karma.Pacino was definitely in rare form here. His latest movies don't live up to this performance. He showed the talent is there, but Hollywood doesn't require that anymore. Duvall, as always turned in a stellar performance.This film captured the good, the bad, and the ugly of crime life and real life. It's riveting and will keep your attention. This film a 9/10.", "That's too good just amazing.": "That's too good just amazing. I just saw this somedays ago.", "Great performances, but often tedious drama.": "7.5 out of 10 for clarification. The Godfather's opening scene is masterful effort, with the camera slowly edging backwards to expose more of Brando's figure to the audience, accompanied by a severely emotional and haunting monologue. After viewing this scene, I conceived the notion that at least a large amount of the film will follow this trend. It was eventually made clear that I was misled. It's not that there aren't other instances of great performances, dialogue and plot twists. The issue is simply that a considerable bulk of the picture is borderline tedious drama, and that much of this drama doesn't in fact contribute to character development. For example, Michael's shift of agenda seems to happen remarkably quickly, and without sufficient character development to provide explanation for this.", "Art of portrait": "America, American, Americans, American italian,american italian don,american italian don of crimes, american italian don of organized crimes with a spectacular screenplay and wonderful portait of characters in 1970's ,I saw that film in 2019 it's mesmerizing.", "great movie": "Best movie. Best dialogue. Overall, it was great.\nI suggest you see", "One of the best movies I have seen": "I don't think it is necessary to say more, because more good film critics are enough to praise this great movie. Forever summer memories, my childhood movie enlightenment.", "A perfect movie.": "\"For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.\"Out of the vast amount of movies, more than 50,000 total to date as of this review, only a few films are described by many a noted film critic as a \"perfect movie\". However, one of those movies, to me, deserves the title of being the most perfect movie out of 'em all. That movie is the 1972 crime drama by the name of \"The Godfather\".Based on the novel by Italian-American author Mario Puzo, this was the movie that revolutionized the art of gangster pictures since its inception. This wasn't like films such as The Roaring Twenties (1939) or The Public Enemy (1931), which were about ordinary mobster life. Instead, we focus on an entire family of the mafia that runs a vast empire in New York City, lead by the aging, yet all powerful Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He's retiring from the business, and has to choose which one of his sons to take his place, either the hair-trigger tempered Sonny (James Caan), adopted son, consigliere, and lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), or his youngest son and war hero Michael (Al Pacino). However, as this is happening, unexpected things are happening within the Corleone family itself including selling out and betrayal, and an all-out war between all of the five families (Corleone, Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracci, and Cuneo) is brewing that turns the entire city into a blood-drenched war zone where only one can remain supreme.The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, whom prior to this was also responsible for movies like Finian's Rainbow (1968), You're A Big Boy Now (1966) and The Rain People (1969), none of which were very successful box office-wise. The Godfather was the turning point of Coppola's career, not just because most of his future pictures would be smash hits, but would also earn him his first Best Picture win. The film itself is poetic, thanks to the assistance from the book's author Mario Puzo, who also wrote the screenplay for the picture. Coppola illustrates both the positive and negative sides of mafia life, the fall and rise of an underground empire, and the meaning of loyalty all at once. All of the main characters in the film are also relatable and three-dimensional to a tee. You actually feel for them and understand their mindset, making it true to life, to where even actual mobsters commend the film for its realism.Future gangster pictures like Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), and Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco (1997) owe something to this movie, aside from the fact that two of those films also star Pacino, making it about not just about the career of a mobster, but also about the mobster himself and the relationship between his colleagues. In other words, they're in-depth character studies, and that's what makes The Godfather a truly epic and moving film, let alone a film that, as I've mentioned in the beginning, is described as a \"perfect movie\". Even teachers in colleges and universities that teach film studies or any form of filmmaking would refer to showing this film as part of a curriculum. Overall, it's a film that is considered mandatory viewing for every moviegoer, even if you don't like sitting through films that are nearly or over 3 hours. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing right now and see it.", "An offer that I could NOT refuse to see": "I am highly addicted to this movie and I enjoyed it ever since the first time I ever saw it. And to tell the truth I could not take my eyes off of it and I was enjoying it up to the max.My favorite character in this movie is Michael Corleone, played by a then younger Al Pacino. He is the best in the whole movie next to Sonny and Vito Corleone. I like Michael because of the way he is with his father and also of his rise to the criminal empire.Sonny is another one of my favorites because he is tough and hard headed and how he defended his younger sister from her abusive husband Carlo Rizzi. But it is a bad thing what happens to him, it was something that angered me.Vito Corleone is also the best one in this movie and my favorite line of him in the movie is: \"I'm going to make him an offer he cannot refuse\". This is one of the best lines in the movie.This movie has great music, characters, storyline and I give it a 10 out of 10.", "If only it hadn't had Coppola in charge....": "...there was potential for 9 or 10 stars. As it is, I'd generally give this 7 stars except that I find it better than Pt2 and that is better than 6 stars so this needs to be 8.I can see and appreciate the subtleties of performance of Brando and Pacino in individual scenes and I can appreciate that there is some feel, some sense of time and place through the production. It is also consistent, no glaringly better or worse parts. And the story is interesting.But 3 things.First, it all feels heavy, flattened, less textured, less alive than any top quality production should. I lay that firmly at the hand of Coppola, a director I find uniformly overrated.Second, I think the material works much better in The Godfather Sage. \"I think\", because that is the way I first watched Pt1 and Pt2 and I thought highly of it at the time. I've seen the theatrical versions now twice since, years apart, first in a cinema, now at home, and neither time thought as highly of each. I wasn't in any hurry to watch either again (this second time) but I hadn't seen the restored version and had access so gave it a go as I never see the Godfather Saga. I also read several reviews which overall tended toward preferring the standalone cinema installments. So gave it a go.Third, the transformation of Michael from outsider with some humanity to the nasty piece of work later in the film is as weak as I can recall in any \"major\" production. OK, maybe this could go under point 1 (it is simply Coppola). But I think not. I think Pacino is talented enough to have worked something that could have got past Coppola and yet still been believable and substantial. It leaves a horribly flimsy core to everything else.Unlike most 7 star or above productions, I can confidently say I won't be watching The Godfather again.", "the Goodfather": "I will be never satisfied of watching it. everything is perfect in this movie.", "2 stars": "The godfather is a wonderful movie, unfortunately I hate this movie", "What to say that hasn't been said?": "Great story of a mafia family. Although this story does not reflect real mafia workings (a fairy tale in comparison) it's great entertainment with a lot of class and a lot of style. The sets are spectacular, acting flawless and characters intriguing.There is a lot of subtle material ocuuring in the continuous power struggle the mafia family is undergoing, especially with Michael. His gradual change, from war hero to Godfather is brought on by the violent events around him. He can't help but be sucked in. His icy cold demeanor is a reflection of the violent world around him and how the human character adapts to it, the transformation from doting husband to ruthless killer. Various events; the assassination attempt on his father, his brother and wife's murder, the betrayal by associates, the beating of his sister, gives him insight into the workings of the human mind. As the cold, clear thinker (as opposed to his animal-like brother, Sonny) he survives and becomes king.Brando is great as the older Don who is starting to lose his edge with oncoming age and the love of his family. His old school mentality does not adapt to the more businesslike, colder generation of mafia hoods where honor and respect are becoming a thing of the past.This movie is marvelous character study comparison between father and son in a violent world.

In today's high tech and fast paced times, there will never be a movie with such depth, and meaning as the Godfather. Some say it's a story about crime, but in actuality it's a story on loyalty and betrayal in a family. About how generations evolve, and particularly about the metamorphosis of Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone, turned for a straight war hero, to the ruthless leader of the Corleone Family. Coppolla's vision will forever be labelled his diffinitive work. The saga which is the Godfather is the greatest story ever told, the characters are authentic and the story is timeless.

The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence.", "The three sons are a tragedy in themselves": "I read the paperback book, \"The Godfather\", when I just became a teenager. The book and the movie are rare for both being excellent, which is why both received high awards.I found the book riveting and I couldn't put it down. But being an innocent young teenager I was horrified by the violence that men can do to men. The character of Luca Brazzi was terrifying, even though it was just fiction. Even the actor who played him, a former, 6'6\" wrestler, was perfect for depicting the quiet, smoldering malevolence as a family 'company' man who took care of the family's enemies in frightening, brutal ways. It was no literary surprise when the Brazzi character met his own brutal karma end.It's easier to gain an assessment of Don Corleone's three sons, Sonny, Fredo, and Michael watching the movie while the book does go into better detail.In the book/movie, Michael, the reluctant son, proves the most capable in the intelligence, cunning, and amorality of his father as his two older brothers fall by the wayside. Yet the whole tragedy is that Michael wanted to be a good man of ethics and morals and would have been a very decent man in a normal family. Fredo, the middle brother was also born in the wrong family. Portrayed as the weak brother, Fredo's weakness was that he completely unsuited mentally, psychologically, and emotionally for life in a crime family and to do the kinds of evil and violent things that would be expected of him. Both men, Fredo, and Michael, would have flourished in normal, middle-class to upper middle-class families. It was the eldest son, Sonny (Santino) who possessed the strength, charisma, apparent leadership ability but not the deep intelligence, foresight, perception, self-control or wisdom to lead the Corleone family.For me the tragedy is not so much the violence or the Corleone family but the two younger brothers, Fredo and Michael, both of whom sincerely and strongly desired to be good men. Fredo's inner weakness led him to betrayal and his ultimate end. Michael's love for his father and family led him to sacrifice the life of a good man for that of an evil crime boss who could give the orders to kill enemies without hesitation and emotion and no regrets.", "A monumental masterpiece!!! score: 10+ (out of 10).": "It is hard to find a flaw with this movie.

Whether younger generations will adjust to it who knows. The wedding at the beginning is probably too long but perseverance for the first 25 minutes pays off later.The Godfather has many iconic scenes, so much so that a lot of them are known to people even if they've never seen this film and they've been parodied heavily over the decades.Although this was originally made as a stand alone film the beauty of the trilogy is that they tie the films together so well, although the third film arrived many years later so feels weaker than the first two it's still essential.

Why can't modern films be more like this masterpiece?!": "So if you asked me what was one of the best films of all time, guess what I would say? The Godfather! My experience with the godfather began all the way back when I was a little kid. I would watch scenes of this movie all the way from 9 years ago. The main reason I love this film, is because it managed to get a book with uncountable sub plots, and turn it into a film with only one plot, Michael's. The way the movie follows Michael, and shows his subtle change through ingenious imagery, and slow but interesting dialogue, into by the end of the film, the big man himself.And its not like Michael hogs the movie or anything, he allows space for Sonny and Vito to grow in, and even for minor characters to give outstanding jobs acting. Another thing, the acting. Oh my god, the acting in this film is phenomenally amazing! It shows you that you can get a bit of the character, dig a hole in it, pour a bit of yourself in to it, and you have yourself a great character, with you playing as it. God! What performances. Brando's performance as Vito, is a textbook case of too good an actor-itis. Not only does the film manage to get something classical like dialogue from the book, and add its own unique style of being calm, but yelling through the words you are saying. Also, the dialogue from this movie, is something so ahead of its time, -Sigh-it's so good. There is no real legitimate criticism I can give The Godfather, besides the fact that it took some sub plots and characters I loved from the book, and chopped them out of the film for a faster run time, which is fine, since the movie is like 4 hours long. I can't tell you much more about the film without giving it away, which would be really messed up as it is a must watch film. It's good. It's the pinnacle of cinema. The zenith of movies. Just watch it it's so great.", "Setting the tone": "The Godfather set the tone for generations of film after it; through directing, acting, the power of music, and the power of culture. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully creates a small world within America, where the Italian culture permeates and adapts to the world around it. Brought to life by giants like Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, and juxtapositioned against an alienated Al Pacino, who evolves his character to a point where he finally shoulders and carries the film. The music is so wonderful to the time the film is set in, and is a character in and of itself, marking distinct scenes into immortality. The Godfather is a film built out of perfection, and easily stands the test of time.", "terribly lackluster": "I personally believe that although the godfather got rave reviews, and is generally thought of as the best movie of all time, I didn't care for it. The truth of the matter is that the epic saga insists upon itself. It was predictable, it was depressing without anything really to be depressed about, and lastly, the dancing elves were really quite over the top, and unnecessary. It was arrogant, pompous, and there was really no plot. It was the worst movie I ever saw. It should have taken a lesson from the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles( which was by the way, the best movie of all time). It was atrocious. Also, what was the deal with the birthday party scene in which Al Pachino gets plastered on moonshine with Barbara Bush, or maybe it was Paula Dean. I can't remember which one; I get the two confused. To even compare this to movies such as The Pink Panther, and The Wiz is atrocious. Both of those movies were brilliant compared to this high budget slouch. Even Marlin Brando's benign performance is not enough to bring this movie up to a two star rating.", "Probably The Best Film That I Have Watched in My History of Watching Films": "My Personal Rating 10/10 This film is an Timeless Classic Masterpiece. the Acting the Soundtrack the Atmosphere the Cinematography almost everything on this Film is unbelievably almost Perfect and aged like a Great Wine, i never saw anything like that in my history of watching Movies. the more time you watch this Movie the more you will love it, that's what i exactly did.

I cannot stand people who have claimed it to be. It is no where as a good as Shawshank, Alien and definitely is not, and never will be, as good as Taxi Driver. It does have its moments and Al Pacino was brilliant, (no I'm not going to give Marlon Brando a shout out, because he too is overrated) the music is stunning and so is the story but it isn't very catching I had to space the viewing over a number of days because I couldn't be arsed watching all at once without felling the urge to watch something else.

I found the film too slow paced, and James Caan was extremely irritable. Vito took FOREVER to recover, and when he did he choked it not long later.Saying that, I respect the film and Coppola on the effort and technical prowess on show. Al Pacino is brilliant, if a little predictable, while Robert Duvall steals the spotlight if you ask me, with a truly masterful performance.The final scene will always be remembered, and for good reason, its artistically genius, but I won'y give it away.This film isn't for everyone, so don't worry if you think you oughta enjoy it just because it's ranked number 1 in the top 250. Just remember that films are always about opinion, and there can never be justifiable official \"Greatest Movie\", so if you don't like it fine, don't let other people hound you down just because they insist that it's the perfect film, because as far as I'm concerned, there can never be a perfect film.As Peter Griffin once said, \"It insists upon itself Louis\".", "Powerful, Stunning, Astonishing, Outstanding, Brilliant, etc.": "This movie has some of Hollywood's top performancesand is a classic on every level on filmaking.Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Diane Keaton star in this brilliant mafia movie about Al Pacino taking over the business when Marlon Brando, playing his father brilliantly, is wounded. Diane Keaton plays his wife and James Cann plays his brother Sonny.Classic Hollywood films can't and don't get much better than this movie. Deserved every oscar it won plus it's nominations.

First things first the movie looks like crap Gordon Willis' Cinematograpthy is absolutely appalling, the editing is just bizarre it looks like it was made by a film maker trying to simulate tension or sadness and tragedy but had no ideas how to use the tools an experienced director would have used, the music made me want to smash my brains in and James Caan as an Italian American gangster was just ridiculous it would be like getting Danny glover to play Maculay Culkins character in home alone, but then again as someone who has seen a lot of the movies produced by Coppola like Peggy sue got married, tucker the man and his dream, the cotton club, Finnians rainbow, the rainmaker and many more poorly filmed dated badly written pieces of forgettable rubbish I should have expected the godfather to be as appalling as i found it, but as everyone who has ever seen the godfather who happens to be a film buff and not just a normal guy in the street who will watch the occasional movie they tend to drool over this muddy looking scrappy overlong bore fest. All in all I would say this movie should probably be destroyed so morons can't talk about how it is the holy grail of all movies ever made.", "One of the most talked-about films of all-time.": "When somebody approaches a screening of The Godfather, there is naturally going to be a bit of nervousness approaching it, since so many people have called one of the greatest films of all-time. There is a feeling that he will come away with comments like \"It wasn't that great.\" or \"That's supposed to be brilliant masterpiece.\" Well, I am going to add some more into the hype machine, because the many other raves about The Godfather are true. It is a phenomenal motion picture that deserves its awards, praise and even more. Francis Ford Coppola constructed one of the shining works of the New Hollywood Era and due to the many spoofs that people produce, both in films, television and YouTube, it has stayed in the memories of countless film lovers. Much like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, a viewing of The Godfather is a must for any film aficionado.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the most powerful mafia family in America. He is aided by his sons, timid Fredo (John Cazale), violent Sonny (James Caan) and the adopted family lawyer Tom Hagen (Robertt Duvall). His youngest, Michael (Al Pacino), has returned home from serving in the Second World War to attend the wedding of his sister (Talia Shire). Unlike his brothers, he wants nothing to do with the family business and prefers to go into in a clean profession. However, after Vito is shot and wounded, Michael's inner Corleone comes out and he decides to seek revenge on those responsible. He flees to Sicily after doing his job and when he returns, he becomes the new Godfather and one of most powerful men in the mob world.Every single aspect of The Godfather has been so praised and analysed by many historians and film critics that it will be difficult to construct an original review. Marlon Brando's performance is incredibly etched into our minds and for good reason as it stands as the pinnacle of this great actor's work on film. Newcomer Al Pacino also provided a stunning acting job, making Michael a fascinating character of the Godfather universe and his brilliant work continued to even greater heights in Part II. James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall add more fantastic triumph to the ensemble with their impressive work as the other three Corleone brothers. It's incredibly insane watching their work knowing that Paramount Pictures did not want them for the parts. Coppola's direction and screenplay (which he co-wrote with the book's author Mario Puzo) are also the film's high points along with Nina Rota's brilliant musical score. The Godfather is a fantastic film experience and a masterpiece of cinema that will and can be viewed many times over.", "Overatted, But Amazing": "This movie has been regarded as the best movie of all time, and I watched it for the first time a couple weeks back. I must admit, it is AMAZING AND DESERVES THE LOVE, but it isn't my My Favourite Movie Ever or anything. I don't even think it cracks my Top Ten, but that's not saying it's not a cultural phenomenon.8.5/10.", "Truly a classic": "No wonder this is considered a classic. The screenplay was excellent, telling a compelling story and eliminating all the unnecessary scenes in the book. The acting was superb. Marlon Brando as the Don was just as powerful and distinguished as I expected him to be. Michael's transformation from college kid who wanted to steer clear of the family business to a godfather in the making was highly convincing. It's a pity that the version I watched lacked subtitles as I don't understand Italian, but I could still follow the plot. I often find that movies don't do justice to the books on which they are based, so it's great to have found one which does the book great credit.", "Best cinema productions": "A series of films of the strongest productions of the world cinema wonderful in every sense of the drama in particular", "Innovative movie of Gangster Genre": "\"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\"\n\"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a good man.\"\n\"Never let anyone know what you are thinking\"These overwhelming quotes are the most discussing insights of this popular gangster trilogy- The Godfather. The first installment released in 1972 and gained both commercial and critical acclaims.The first part revolves around the godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and how he deals with his competitors at NY city. At the same time, he is too caring about his family. He wants to involve his younger son Micael Corleone (Al Pacino), who just returns from World War 2. He has a faith on his younger son than his two elder sons. He faces different troubles from his anti groups lead by Solozzo, to whom Vito refused to do narcotic business. Vito thinks that narcotics would harm the society a lot. And, he aspires to stop Solozzo by sending his men and later his elder son Sonny. But it was Michael, who successfully defeats in battles with the help of Clemenza (Richard Castellano), who is a caporegime and the godfather of Sonny. In a battle with the opponents, Vito losses his elder son Sonny. Also, in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.\nDevastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins.The performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino was quite remarkable and the accolades they received proved this.In the 30th Golden Globe Award, the film had won the categories for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Picture - Drama out of 7 nominations. In the 45th Academy Award (Oscar), the film had nominated in 11 categories,and out of them, it won three of the Academy Awards: Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. The interesting fact is that, Marlon Brando refused to take the Oscar for raising his voice against the poor treatment of American Indians by the film industry who have virtually no representation in the film industry and were primarily used as extras", "Positive": "Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.", "good, but not the best.": "I was entertained by the Godfather. A lot. So don't think that this is a negative review.The godfather has kind of set it self up to be kind of like a joke now. Come on. \"Don't forget the canole!\" It is kind of stereotypical of Italians, even though Coppola himself was an Italian and didn't intend it to be that way. Marlon Brando is great, but he is still way overrated. Al Pacino, however, is amazing, and made me rethink my earlier opinion that he was an overactor. James Caan of course is great, as is Diane Keaton. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as Part Two, which is a masterpiece.Oh, and one more thing... Nino Rota made the best score ever with this one.\n7/10 Stars", "Good, very well-made film, but somewhat overrated": "I think The Godfather is very well-made and a good film on the whole; very well-acted, well-scored, and had effective dialogue, but I think it's somewhat overrated.This is the story it TRIED to tell........Michael Corleone is the son of Sicilian Mafia Don Vito Corleone. Unlike his siblings, he wants nothing to do with the family business, and his father wouldn't have it any other way. After getting back from WWII, he wants to shield his girlfriend Kay from his family. But when a rival to Vito named Sollozzo comes along, a chain of events is set into motion that culminates in Vito's life hanging in the balance. Although he wanted nothing to do with the business, he decides to kill those who are a threat to Vito out of love for his father. By so doing, he forced himself to live in exile in Sicily for 3 years, where he learns more of the family/Sicilian tradition, and gets married. Soon after the death of his new wife Apollonia, he was able to return to the US and is reunited with Kay. Only he isn't the same man who she knew from before; he is very much a part of the family business, and indeed is the actual head of the mafia. He wants Kay to marry him, but not so much because he loves her as because of his newly-found Sicilian beliefs in the importance of family. He is now cold and ruthless in the way he deals with his enemies, and by the end of the film, he became the very sort of person that he wanted nothing to do with at the beginning of the movie.This is how the story came across to me..........Michael Corleone is the son of Sicilian Mafia Don Vito Corleone. Unlike his siblings, he wants nothing to do with the family business, and his father wouldn't have it any other way. After getting back from WWII, he wants to shield his girlfriend Kay from his family. The movie does a dismal job in establishing this, and also does a dismal job in establishing the Michael/Kay relationship. Other than a few lines in the opening wedding scene, we never really got to know Michael back when he was a good man, and we hardly saw any of Michael/Kay together back when their relationship was healthy. So then he kills Sollozzo & that cop, runs to Sicily, then gets hit \"by the thunderbolt\" of Apollonia, whom I found to be very annoying. So we get a montage of Michael's life in Sicily (seen while some very nice music is playing), and all of a sudden he wholeheartedly embraces the Sicilian way of family, mob, etc. Michael comes back to America a changed man, and the film finishes with the process of his transformation being complete, but because of the poor job the film did in establishing who he was prior to the events of the movie, and how the change itself actually happened, Michael becoming what he once opposed ended up having very little impact on me.Still, a good movie on the whole, with some great scenes like the restaurant shooting and the front yard talk between Michael & Vito.", "Greatest film of all time": "May contain spoilers*To review what is in my mind the greatest film of all time could involve many superlatives, mind blowing, genius, astonishing. All of which would be true, but its the components that make up those superlatives that I'd like to write about. I procrastinated watching the Godfather trilogy for about a year. My dad had pushed me to watch the films but for reasons that now seem insignificant I refused. One of the reasons was the length of these films, my OCD wouldn't allow me to only watch the first film, as I had been told by a few people the second film was even better.Another reason was the subject matter, I just didn't think gangster films where my thing, how wrong I was. Several Godfather sessions later and the procrastination of watching them in the first place seems comical.From the first second to the last, The Godfather had me mesmerised (theres one of those superlatives I spoke about) the film completely took me to another world, a believable one too. I was in awe of the big named actors that I'd seen in more recent films but never actually seen the film that they were all known best for. Al Pacino's break through role, Marlon Brando's peak performance, along with Robert Duvall and James Caan. Two actors who i'd grown up watching in various other films and yet I'd neglected the one they surely must be most proud of.I grew up seeing cartoons such as the Simpsons reference the Godfather, never knowing what the references where. Famous scenes such as the horses head in the bed and Marlon Brando stroking his cat as he talks of respect. All things I'd seen homaged and yet there I was... a clueless kid.I've seen many Al Pacino and Marlon Brando films, but to have them in the same film, its an honour to watch. Two of the greatest actors of all time and probably two of my top three (along with Robert De Niro who features in the sequel).I could go on forever about the stylisation, cinematography and genius direction from Francis Ford Copolla but the simple truth in my eyes. As a matter of fact the truth in most people's eyes, is that this is the greatest film of all time. A perfect 10/10.", "Couldn't refuse this piece of cinema": "Upon my decision to finally sit down and watch this film, I was well aware of some of the cultural influences made by this film. I was aware of, \"Make him an offer he can't refuse\" and, \"I don't get no respect\". I knew of these quotes and was pretty sure they were from this film. Solidified obviously when I watched, but I was also made aware of more quotes and clich\u00e9s from this film. The horse head in bed, for instance. The voice and manner of Don Vito. So many iconic quotes and lines came from this film that it would be impossible to give it anything lower than a 10 just for that. And now, the film itself. The acting in this film was out of this world. Brando seems to become Don Vito as much as he is himself. Al Pacino is a new world of acting. His way of showing the inner battles Michael faces as he attempts to stay out and stay a good man is beautiful. The decisions he makes obviously affect him in many ways, and Pacino does this representation of conflict and struggles flawlessly. As entertaining and as high-octane as this film was, there was one piece of cinematography that I noticed throughout. This being the lighting of Marlon Brando. Throughout the film, Don Vito goes through a lot, from being the mob boss of New York to being bed-bound. The lighting of his eyes in his office, particularly, is absolutely breathtaking. His entire face is portrayed in this eerie yellow light which allows for some beautiful shots with cigarette smoke as well. But, this yellow light is positioned so perfectly that it darkens his eyes, so they are just black holes of emptiness. It gives the illusion of inhumanity, of heartlessness. Even outside at the wedding, his eyes are still sunken. However, when bed bound, the lighting is right in his eyes, and you can see right into him. This is merely one example of a probable infinite amount of examples of excellent cinematography that you could get from this film. One of my most entertaining watches ever, and somehow Coppola keeps me gripping the edge of my chair for 2 hours. An absolute must watch for any human being breathing air. A classic now, a classic then, and a classic for years and years to come.", "Coppola's epic masterpiece": "One of the greatest films ever made!  It stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Rober Duvall and James Caan as members of a powerful mob family.  Brando is unforgettable and Pacino's transformation from responsible son to menacing thug is eerily effective.  Some unforgettable scenes include the shooting in a deli.  This is the greatest crime film ever made and stands as a great \"male\" soap opera. Don't forget about the Godfather Part 2!  You'll miss more of the greatness! (The Godfather Part 3 is good, but poor by comparison)", "Impressed deeply": "I was deeply impressed by two places in this film, one was cold revenge, and the other was warm affection. I always dreamed that when I was about to age, I could have the supreme right to speak like Godfather Corleone. I also dreamed of having a happy family and having fun.", "best movie in history": "The best movie in the history of cinema\nThere really is no more unique than this movie in my opinion\nI have little to say\nI still enjoy watching this movie and learning something from it.", "One of the great works of cinema": "THE GODFATHER C-170min(1972)****D:Francis Ford Coppola. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte. Francis Ford Coppola's unique crime saga remains one of the most popular and memorable films ever made as a Mafia boss's innocent son gets into the family busisness. A strong American film with moving performances, top-notch direction, and a tightly-plotted Oscar winning script by Coppola and Mario Puzo from his novel along with Nino Rota's tragic score and Gordon Willis'sgroundbreaking cinematography makes this a superlative effort. Oscar winner for Best Picture and to Brando's magnetic performances. Followed by two sequels.", "A Grand Masterpiece....": "Almost every person who sees Hollywood films has at least heard of The Godfather, it is considered by multiple sources as one of the best films ever made in history, many people have also claimed that this is the best film ever made. I am not sure if I agree with the latter point, but I can proudly say is that the Godfather is just a Grand masterpiece which not only a fan of the crime genre but anyone who likes movies in general can enjoy. Now this is a 1972 film some people say it has not aged well, I disagree that film is still entertaining to watch, the plot will still grasp your attention and you will still be on the edge of your seat. The main thing that this movie does different compared to the movies of today's generation that it moves at a very very slow pace not that it's a bad thing, back then almost all films did that, the minor scenes went on for quite long. I mean seriously has there even been a recent movie in which a party or wedding scene went on for over 10 minutes (unless the actual film was based upon it)? Now I will not take away from this movie because of of prolonged scenes because the movie still makes sure to progress its story slowly in such scenes to keep the viewer interested. However these scenes also make the movie go on for 3 hours which kind of hurts its replay value. But even if you watch the Godfather once you will simply be in awe of it's magnificent story, brilliant characters and perfect setting and environment. This film is also a very realistic portrayal of mobs in Italy during that time period. All actors bring the characters to life and very so into the characters that you will feel like they are the characters themselves rather than actual actors. The acting is simply among the best I have seen in any movie, not just from the lead Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but even the supporting characters like Sonny played by James Caan or Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall are fantastically portrayed. Even the minor and the female characters play their part to perfection. There is nothing really bad to say about the acting.The plot is about the Corleone family and how it tries to co-exist with the other mobs. The story is fantastic with many twists and turns throughout and will keep you engaged about what will happen next, the movie does not move rapidly fast but it moves at a very slow pace to allow the viewer to get a better idea of the characters and the plot. The ending is also fantastic and is a perfect example of character development.The soundtrack is also fantastic and fits all the scenes in the movie, the main theme of the film in particular still sounds awesome even to this very day. The movie also takes itself very seriously, it does not do comedy, apart from a very few and rare scenes, this film is very serious and rightfully so it deals with a very serious topic and the events that transpire throughout are very difficult, tragic and severe for this movie to be anything else. The film is violent but it is not what you see throughout 90% of the film, the violence which is there, serves its purpose and progresses the plot in a meaningful way.Apart from the pacing, I felt like this film was a little hard to understand sometimes without subtitles specially when the Italian language is spoken, we are still not completely clueless to what's actually going on but knowing what the characters are actually saying would have helped. But that is only a minor issue which does not take away from the overall film.In the end, I just want to say what has already been said many times, The Godfather one of the best films ever made in history and anyone who likes Hollywood cinema in general and still hasn't watched this masterpiece, should just watch this classic, this is Hollywood at it's very finest.Overall Rating: 10/10", "Well made and well acted but ultimately slow paced and pretty boring.": "After seeing this movie numerous times I have to say that overall I find it highly overrated.  It is definately well crafted and the acting is superb. However the pacing is dreadfully slow at times and while I think overall the acting is strong it does get a little overblown at times.  Definately one of the best movies in its genre, unfortunately imho its not a genre with many good films.", "Awesome Film": "I like This Movie Very Much GodFather I think its seasons should release Now in 2020 lOL", "A Story of Loyalty and Family": "The Godfather explores criminality, the temptations of wealth, loyalty, and what one is willing to do to protect those they love. There is a theme in the story of life and death, a duality of one thing ending and another beginning. While Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is a successful and capable character within a crime family, he only fills this role to protect those he loves. This film explores the ideas of the complicated villain. Justice, loyalty, and family are of ultimate importance, but there is a criminal twist to these ideals.The Godfather asks us all: how far will you go to protect your family? And does the ends justify the means? The Corleone's enemies operate the same way as they do, eliminating any notion of good and evil. It's simply \"them vs us\". In such a vile environment, the only virtue one can have is loyalty.In the opening of the film, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is throwing a wedding for his daughter. During this peaceful and happy family event, dozens of loyal followers come to Vito to pay their respects, and in some cases, request unhappy favors. The first guest shown with Vito elaborates an important point of the film: an Italian immigrant has been wronged and refused justice by a corrupt system. Therefore, the father goes down a dark path and comes to the Godfather for justice. This is an example of the ends justifying the means, the duality of using evil for good. In a way, the father received justice for his daughter, but he's also a murderer for taking the law into his own hands and punishing another beyond what the law would have called for. The opening scene also highlights the contrast of having a happy wedding while at the same time, making arrangements to have people murdered. This theme is reflected throughout the film, with a powerful ending.", "a film depicting the little Italy in NY": "People always say America is a big melting pot, but actually it is not actually like that. America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism.", "To the Point!": "I have seen The Godfather many times over the past twenty years.  It started with my brother watching the movie and I watched it when I was seven.  The only parts I remembered at the time were the famous scenes (the horse's head, Sonny being setup at the toll booth) which goes to show you that if a movie can put a searing memory in a seven year old critic, imagine what it can do to the same critic twenty years later!This is without a doubt one of the top 5 best movies of all time, BAR NONE.  If anyone disagrees with this, you obviously do not know a genius film when you see one or you don't like excellent storytelling, acting, directing, filming, etc. (and who doesn't).  If you enjoy bad movies, don't see this one.

Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality.Michael starts out an idealistic young man who looks down on the dirty deeds of the family business. In the end, Michael save the Corleone family. But in order to do so, he has become the ultimate insider (the Don) and loses the values he had held so dear at the beginning.It's a classic story that can be argued to humanize a criminal family by making us a member of it through Michael's transformation. The stakes are laid out such that we have to believe the ends justify the means. This idea, to protect the family at any cost, is taken to its logical extreme in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II and then the pied piper comes calling for payback in the finale The Godfather: Part III. But Part I is what stands apart from its distinctive internal arc of Michael. In the other two movies, Michael's determination and moral center never wavers, we just see the external world's consequences of his moral choices.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.", "The EPIC!": "A movie which certainly does not need a review for sure. Commanding performance of entire cast, all dialogues are already written in silver line, epic scenes and marvellous acting of Marlon and Al Pacino.I would love to quote a scene where Al Pacino went to visit two men in a hotel where he eventually wanted to kill them both, that scene is majestic, it gives goosebump, chilling and thrilling and what an actor this man is. Greatest.Plus the director, man man!!! what a direction, everything is awesome, the class about this movie, you can't complain, watch it and learn leadership, importance of family, relationship, decision making and so on.", "Easily lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest films ever": "The Godfather is one of those movies that could be considered perfect or near perfect. It's a perfect ten in just about every category of what makes a great film: Cinematography, story, character development, action sequences, acting, plot twists...this movie is an absolute masterpiece. There's no clich\u00e9s or corny moments, no annoying, useless characters, and its about as original as it comes in all aspects of story. The Corleone family is both evil and moral, both sympathetic and begging for hatred, both understandable and from another world. Vito Corleone is a ruthless crime boss, but at the same time, has standards and a sense of right and wrong. Michael Corleone goes from being a war hero who claims that he is not his family, to a mafia don more ruthless than his father. Sonny, his older brother, is a loose cannon, but with method to his madness. Every time I watch this movie, I ask myself: How did Coppola and Puzo do it? How can this movie be described as anything except perfect? If I have ANY gripe with The Godfather, at the toll booth, there's no way that somebody could take that many rounds and still not be incapacitated. Yeah, people don't always drop with one round in real life, but fifteen guys opening up on full auto with .45 ACP rounds from a Tommy Gun is going to kill pretty damn quickly! But I'm a gun nut, so that's a nit pick. That, I guess knocks the Godfather down to about a 9.999999999999999999 out of 10!", "The reference film for any other film, actor or director": "I had seen The Godfather many years ago but when I wanted to write this review I decided to watch it again. And of course my mind has never changed, the movie is almost always flawless with a super cool opening scene. We lived through the moments of the mafia's life from conflict, revenge, and everything, whether negative or negative.\nThis is without forgetting the scenario and directing, as well as the performance of the legendary actors, especially by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. For me, there are some lapses that are not very impressive, which I will not mention in order to avoid them Spoilers", "A great, but flawed, morality tale": "Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has become firmly embedded in popular culture due in no small part to Marlon Brando's mannerisms, exaggerated jaw line, and the film's rhythmic dialogue. It has therefore rightly earned its position as a classic in American cinematic history. However, its fame may have had an unfortunate and unintended side effect of glorifying organized (as opposed to disorganized, indiscriminate) crime by raising it to an almost \"noble profession\" for some. Despite the sociological impact, the film's music, cinematography, and authentic period cars and clothes were very effective. While the film has a clear and unmistakable pace at which dialogue is delivered and scenes are developed, which succeeds in holding the viewer's attention, the pace is undeniably slow and the film is long. Yet the characters are interesting and the film will hold your interest.At its core, this film is about an Italian-American family trying to modify its business practices to survive in an uncertain and rapidly evolving world but in the process continues its tradition of \"violence as honor,\" while aligning itself to religious principles it does not share for in the \"Godfather's world\" another religion in practiced, a religion which revolves around money, power, and honor of family and turf. Make no mistake, this is a good film and Francis Ford Coppola deserves credit for his direction and screenwriting, but in my view it does not earn the 10/10 that thousands of IMDb voters have given it for the following reason: When the plot is boiled down to its essential elements, it's just a story about one highly dysfunctional family confronted by a changing society, the demise of an old world, and relentless problems with neighbors and neighborhoods. This is a common theme used in many different ways in innumerable films before and after The Godfather's release, so this aspect does not differentiate The Godfather from many other films in Mafioso and other dramatic genres.\nFor me, a fundamental problem existed with the subplots of honor and family. While there is a strong \"honor code\" which everyone in \"the family\" is compelled to hold to great esteem, i.e. respect for the family, its traditions, its business interests, and the expectation and necessity of showing the utmost respect for the head of the family (which is certainly not uncommon among Aboriginal, Semitic and East and Southeast Asian traditions), when it comes right down to it this is just a thin veneer to cover all of the nasty deeds the family is involved in, e.g. corruption, racketeering, gambling, intimidation, and retaliatory murders to even the score. Except for drugs and prostitution, most crimes are well within the inventory of the family business, despite early protestations to the contrary by Michael Corleone (played by a young, almost unrecognizable Al Pacino) whose personality is transformed over the course of the film's trials and tribulations only to have him emerge as a sadistic aspiring re-builder of the Corleone empire.Without giving away the plot, an aspect of the film appeared obvious in its intent. One of the key reasons for Don Vito Corleone's 45-film-minutes of slumber (the result of being comatose after an attempt on his life) was to serve as a device at mid-point to summarize early plot developments courtesy of 'Consigliore' Robert Duvall for both Brando's and the audience's benefit. This seemed intentional to underscore the significant impact of events in the first half of the family's saga to those of the rest of the film.\nThe Godfather is an interesting and deservedly controversial morality tale about one immigrant family's traditions and its continuous power struggles, but because of plot and thematic elements mentioned above, I give it an 8/10, which isn't bad at all.", "This movie was boring!!!!! Overated-Big Time.": "Well,  what can i say. I rented the Godfather from the library and I completely disliked it.   I gave it an effort but the beginning was so boring that I could bearly tolerate it and I had to take a break from the film.  When I came back I saw people in cars being blown up,   Marlon Brando being injured, an abused wife going crazy with the dishes, Al Pacino young and vengeful  and ,more and more deaths. Big Deal! The people that died were people that were underveloped and I can't say i cared much.  And what's the big fuss about Marlon Brando acting,  he just talked in a funny voice and relaxed-in A Streetcar Named Desire he actually give an effort to act. Well,  i have to admit that I did not finish the film.   It just wasn't fun enough,   not entertaining, and I think the acting nowadays is better.   The part that I shut the film off is when Marlon fell in the garden and the little boy went away.  I then shut it off and said,  that's nice.  If the ending is good then maybe I'll finish watching the Godfather, but i don't know.  It was just not entertaining.  Very boring.   The day before I saw the film I saw the three hour Casino,  which I liked because the music,  the acting, and the excellent 90's pace.   It dealt with the mafia,  Casino,  but people like Sharon Stone and pace made the film emotionally involving.   Watch Casino and then watch The Godfather and ask yourself,    which film was more entertaining?", "Not Impressed": "Over the years, I had heard a lot about this movie but, for some reason, had never seen it. About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!Although I began watching it with high expectations, they were gone within about 20 minutes. I found it to be boring to the extreme and almost turned it off on several occasions, but I decided to stick with it in the hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't. By the time that it had ended, I was actually mad that I had wasted over two hours of my life watching it.I realize that I'm in the extreme minority, but I absolutely did not like this movie at all.", "\"Only god can do this\"": "This movie is rightfully regarded as one of the best ever made because of its epic grandeur while keeping the patience and intimacy typical of European art filmmaking. Although there are legitimate concerns about The Godfather's impact in maintaining stereotypes of Italian Americans, makers of movies, TV series, and video games continue to be influenced by it decades after its release. Our collective cultural memory includes Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper, the lavish set design, and the music by Nino Rota.The movie has an operatic feel, although it's more subdued than flashy. It treats its subjects seriously and gives the Mafia's power conflicts the respect they would ordinarily only receive as classical themes in fine art. After the film's debut, American filmmakers began to risk taking themselves and their artistic. There's something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia.", "Quite Possibly the greatest film ever made": "The Godfather earns its status as a landmark in cinema. Coppola outdoes himself in his direction, and the performance of Marlon Brando as the titular character may be the most iconic role in film history. Sporting a great story, lots of suspense and a perfect ending, The Godfather is a must see for anybody.", "Most overrated movie ever": "I've never been so bored in my life like when i watched this movie. I started watching it with a big expectations due to what people say about it . But at the end, i ended up forcing my self to finish it. maybe because it's too old ? i don't know. The only good thing was the acting for sure. The main actor was a phenomenon.", "Mafia and gangs wasn't my thing but": "Mafia and gangs wasn't my thing but I decided to watch it for changing, and with all these reviews I expected something will make my head blow. I would say it's not that different from other gangs movies so ..", "Offer you can't refuse": "This film put mafia films out there many parts of it are undeniably perfect acting, cinematography and story-telling.It introduces us to the cruel world it is where power buys you respect, and it is earned through putting fear into people.The Godfathers only criticism is it's slowness - and today no films like that could ever be put into production - and it might have to be viewed more seriously then other films but definitely worth the watch. Shout out to Marlon Brando for giving us the best piece of acting in history.", "The ultimate guys movie": "First of all, this is THE ultimate guys movie. Phrases like \"Drop the gun, get the cannoli\" have never been topped in American movie history. This is the kind of movie you want to watch with your pals while drinking beer. The story is just great. That and Brando's acting make it a 10 in entertainment.\nThe Godfather is almost a documentary of the Mafia Progress in America (forget Pilgrim's Progress). Most of the scenes are related to some real event. Of course they are all put together into a single story-line for entertainment but it does paint an accurate picture; Vito, the old Don with humane instincts, Michael, the ruthless and efficient successor, the roots in Brooklyn, the rise in NY, the move to Vegas, everything.\nThen there are the characters; Brando telling Michael that he has no regrets, except that he couldn't achieve more so Michael could be a \"Governor\" or something, that he had never walked on anybody's string, etc. The very image of the self-made man. Michael, descending from Straight and Gentle to making an offer that Moe Green couldn't refuse. The Family, which is a composite character that pervades everything and justifies everything. And on and on... so many contrasts, so much going on.\nThis movie could only be made in America. It shows a raw and powerful side. It is Metaphor because it reflects the rest of the country. It is cultural because it educates. And the Finale is Epic.", "Truly awe-inspiring...": "I cannot add anything about this movie that hasn't already been said by people a lot more experienced about movies than I am. \nI can say this though.  Few movies have ever grabbed my attention and not let go like this one has.  Look at the expression on Al Pacino's face when he tells his brother never to take sides against the family again.  There is no doubt about the enormous anger he is fighting to control or about what the results will be if he ever loses that control.  Look at Marlon Brando as the reserved dignified old Don spending his last moments playing like a child with his grandson in the garden.  And look at Robert Duval when Sal pleads for the favor of his life after he has turned traitor to Michael. And last, look at Dianne Keaton in the last scene when she realizes the her husband IS the Godfather.These are the things that make a movie great.  Standout moments of acting by those who define acting.  These are the moments that elevate acting to an art form (and film is just as much an art form as painting or music or poetry).  This movie is FILLED with just such moments.", "A truly great film!": "This movie is the best mafia movie ever made, and quite possibly the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando was brilliant as was the rest of the cast. I recently saw Citizen Kane(which is a very good movie) but I would have to say that the Godfather is far superior. Overall 11/10 Absolutely Brillant Film!!!", "It has a significant impact on crime-type movies and has epoch-making significance": "As a classic film, \"The Godfather\" is perfect in storytelling, performance, photography, and movie skills, and can be used as a textbook for movies. As an epic film, the whole story has a huge pattern, a complicated plot, and many characters. There are more than 20 characters who need to be expressed, but the film handles them in an orderly manner. Under Coppola's superb director skills, the characters are distinct in primary and secondary, and the character is full. Some characters only need one lens and one detail to express the character's character.", "Smart human": "A wise woman does not expose a man's lies.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

Finally, in da end, i just found that i was left kind of disappointed. I feel Goodfellas dominates over this film threefold.", "A masterpiece you can\u00b4t refuse to see": "Francis Ford Coppola is one of the most influential and beloved film directors of all time, from the fantastic stories his movies tell to the great characters he directs and shows on the screen. Many film enthusiasts, myself included, think highly of his works, even to this day, and while I would gladly love to talk about all he did right, I today gather you all around to talk about his magnum-opus, the 1972 crime film The Godfather, based on Mario Puzo\u00b4s 1969 novel of the same name.Now, there are several reasons as to so many people love this movie, but what I most enjoy about it are the immensely lovable characters, with a special mention to The Godfather himself, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, who carries the film with his lovable and caring personality hidden under a dark and mysterious mafia boss figure, his distinctive speech mannerism, further enhanced by Brando\u00b4s amazing performance, his very relatable and deep character arch, and all of his creative \"orders they can't refuse\"; when Vito dies, you really feel sad about it, along with the other characters, who are also really likable and unique in their own ways. It\u00b4s honestly quite shocking that Coppola was able to make the mafia family so easily relatable, but that\u00b4s what\u00b4s so fascinating and astonishing about Godfather.Something that is also quite phenomenal is it\u00b4s story, which not only deeply analyses the criminal family scenario like no other crime drama, but also tackles profoundly the idea of letting go of old habits and embracing the new, and exploring why some people don\u00b4t support this ideology, while documenting the brutality of gang warfare in a very respectful way.The score by Nino Rota is pure perfection, with its somber, suspicious and tense vibes, as is the cinematography by Gordon Wills, Francis Ford Coppola\u00b4s direction, and everything else that makes The Godfather not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but also cinematic perfection and of the many reasons why Coppola is such an acclaimed director.As you can guess, I simply cannot reccomend this film enough. Watch it by all means necessary, wether it be on Blu-ray, Digital Versatile/Video Disc, streaming it, you really must watch this (as long as you are appropriately aged, that is). Trust me, you won\u00b4t regret it.", "Just masterpiece": "Never can this kind of movie be ever made... Francis Ford Coppola had given this masterpiece with excellent star cast who did amazing screen presence... particularly Marlon Brando & Al Pacino were fabulous in their role. Story, screenplay & background score to it's best.", "A movie is not worth your time.": "The movie is very long and the directing is bad to the extreme, the characters are badly written, the character who tries to be scary and the ones who try to be attractive but they are all vulgar, and the dialogues in the film are bad and also the drama is bad.", "A REASON ITS THE BEST OF THE BEST": "Truly one of the greatest not only crime movies but movies of all time. From the dialog to the settings to the shots to the acting to the story. The unpredictability in this movie in uncanny. Micheal knows what he wants from the beginning and jumps when he has an opportunity to reach it. Micheals ambition starts to cloud his judgement because he's so young and never had all that power before, it starts to go to his head. Unlike his father who wanted peace asking for a truce with the other mob heads. Each character has a unique personality and the acting for each character is completely different than the next. This is truly one of the greatest stories of all time. You witness a man come back from war than do a deed for his father than go back to Italy only to come back than take over the family. The look of sadness on vitos face when he learns Michael did the deed makes me feel sad even thinking about it.I seriously wonder if their will ever be another movie like this agian.", "Greatest ever": "Simply the best movie I have ever seen.  I saw this movie as a pre-teen and have fallen more in love with it every time I've seen it since.  Something about the perfection of each performance along with the dialogue, I dunno...it's just perfect.  Coppola's (and Robert Evans') legacy.", "Best movie ever.": "The godfather series basically divides its characters into strong and weak. But while doing this, \"Fredo's weaknesses so that the excitement will come to the story.\" or \"I need a sensible man to handle this Tom.\" there is no thought. There are situations brought by the development of each character and as I said, you can see the logic of all the characters with a single rule. What is this rule? \"Hard times make strong people, strong people make good times; good times create weak people, weak people make hard times,\" writes Michael Hopf. Can be explained in words. Now, let's go through the members of the corleone family, how this word has become a spelling mechanic one by one.First of all, of course, there is Don Vito Corleone. Vito was born in Sicily. His father and older brother are killed by a local mob. Later, he sees that his mother was also shot in front of his eyes. He came to America as an immigrant when he was 9 years old. But cannot enter the country immediately. Because there are signs of smallpox. So he stays alone in quarantine for a certain period of time. When he gets older, he starts living in a part of New York called Little Italy. Here he stays with his wife and children in a small apartment, and works in jobs that do not make much money. Vito later becomes unemployed due to Don Fanucci. So he starts petty thefts with his friends. Hearing this, Don Fanucci kills him when he asks them to pay tribute. Thus the title \"frost\" passes to him.As you can see, vito is a character created by hard times. That's why he likes to hold power. He also came out of the Italian immigrants and saw how they struggled with difficulties. That's why he is always accommodating in his dealings with people. Because he knows that if a person he corners becomes helpless, he will become \"himself\". Also vito helps everyone around him. For example, in the second movie, we see a woman who has been kicked out of her house and goes to talk to the landlord. From this, we can say that the \"good times\" we saw in the first movie were brought by him.Since we started from the eldest in the family, then let's go in order of age. In second place is Sonny Corleone. In fact, Santino was born into difficult times, although not as much as his father. However, we can hardly see the influence of these times on this character, as his father turned into \"don corleone\" until he was old enough to know his surroundings.Also, when Sonny was growing up, his father was the most important person in his neighborhood. Here we can deduce this. Sonny, yes, a person who can't control his nerves. But normally angry people learn to cope with it in order not to be excluded from society. For example, you went to a restaurant and you are very hungry, your food does not come. Even if you are a very angry person, you will not show your anger in front of other people eating because you will end up being disgraced. But sonny has never felt the need to restrain himself in this way all his life. People were trying not to piss him off anyway. But even if Sonny got angry in the most inappropriate place, people couldn't react because he is Vito Corleone's son anyway. What can they say?With this power in his hands, Sonny's anger barriers gradually fell, eventually costing him his life. Because Connie's wife got very angry with Carlo, which prevented her from thinking cautiously. If he hadn't suddenly gotten angry and waited there, he wouldn't have been drawn into the trap. That's why, although he seems like a tough character, sonny grew up in good times and became a person who could not prevent a situation that would be weak for him.He looked at Tom Hagen's last name and said, \"So this guy is Corleone?\" If you thought, I recommend you to watch the movies again. Because as a son, Tom is no better than any other member of the family. There is even more. Tom, as mentioned in the movie, was found by Sonny while living on the street and brought home to live together. Meanwhile, Vito adopted him as his adopted son.Tom knows that although he actually grew up in the \"good times\" like Sonny, he joined the family later. He also never forgets the kindness that Vito did to him. And although he is seen as a brother by everyone, he is not of Sicilian origin. This sets it apart from others. So tommy is actually a character created by hard times. As he felt indebted to the family in some way, he went to study law and became a lawyer. He is also the most competent and cautious person to help Vito until Michael shows up. As a person who came from hard times, he helped Vito create good times and never showed weakness while doing this.After tom and sonny, there is the middle brother fredo corleone, whose vulnerabilities are most clearly visible. Fredo is actually a person who will not be related to his father's business. However, Vito cannot plan to make him a senator like Michael did. Because fredo is a not very brave man who thinks momentarily and lives momentarily. He has struggled with difficulties since his childhood. Fredo, on the other hand, has never had any difficulties in his life because he is a man made of good times. Does not consider his responsibilities. Even when Moe is sent to Greene's, he is more concerned with other things than work. Even though he knows he's causing trouble, he can't change about it anymore because probably the mistakes he made in his childhood stayed with him. So he never developed a habit of being cautious or thinking about the outcome of events. Because fredo is a weak man made of good times. Throughout the movie series, they have always treated fredo through his incompetence. But as I said, the reason for this inadequacy is that he never really needs to be a sufficient person. As a result, he played a game against the toughest and most cunning man of the family and paid for it with his life. Even from here it can be understood that he does not think about the end of events.After Fredo, it was Michael Corleone's turn. Michael's change actually continues throughout the three movies. So we have so many details. But the important question is: Why didn't michael turn out like fredo or sonny? Because michael is a character born for good times like his brothers. But Michael is a more forward thinking person than his brothers. Therefore, he sees the situation of the family differently from his brothers.Thanks to this foresight and the ability to see things more broadly, Michael can understand the danger around him more clearly. For example, while Fredo was daylighting in Vegas, Michael was wondering who was going to cause him trouble there. He was probably like that in his youth as well, so he tried to distance himself from his family. But did not succeed. Once he got involved, he tried to create \"good times\" for his family, albeit fake, just like his father.In the last place is the youngest member of the family, Connie Corleone. He is one of the most radical characters in the series in terms of change. Connie appears as a very pampered character in the first movie. How do we know this? Because vito is actually not happy with the person he married, but he still allows it. And when I was talking about Sonny, \"I pampered my kids too much.\" she was saying. We see an example of this on the best connie.In fact, there is very little room for women in the movie, but as we can see from apollonia and carmela corleone, Sicilian women are normally strong, proud and haughty. They continue to support their spouses even if something bad happens in their family. For example, we never see Carmela crying or beating. The woman is already singing somewhere. He also dies in another scene, but they are not hysterical like in the Scorsese movies.Connie, on the other hand, is different from these women from the beginning. Because it's probably not the first concession Vito made about Connie at the beginning of the first movie. Also, in the third movie, we learn that his father was choked with presents on his birthday by an old friend. And connie never sees the dark side of the family business. So we can say that he lives the \"good times\" more than sonny or fredo.Connie's change is as follows: she starts living a messy life after losing her husband, but later on she realizes how difficult Michael is and returns. Because she realizes that the situation is not good, that her brother and family have been in \"hard times\" from the beginning. Already in the third movie, we see him as a toothy character created by hard times.So why didn't this character become a tom? Because tom boy.", "Clandestine butchery": "I admire the way authors and directors have fun with their readers and viewers by including scenes of great dramatic impact that are completely unexplained.The Godfather has a perfect example in the 'horse's head in bed' vignette. Implicitly we are required to believe that intruders armed with equipment to decapitate a stallion in the prime of life breezed into the stable block of what was presumably a fortified estate belonging to a movie mogul. Khartoum is somehow subdued without startling the other horses, stable lads, nightwatchmen, burglar alarms etc. His head is severed with stealth and silence. Then the slaughterers break into the movie producer's house and make their way to his bedroom, carrying the bleeding head with them. After what has already been accomplished there's no problem in placing the head under the duvet at the foot of the bed and smearing blood all over the slumberer's pyjamas, hands and face without waking him. Whistling a happy tune, perhaps, the horse butchers, recruited from afar at a moment's notice, make their exit without difficulty or detection.More nominations please for the most outrageous, impossible scene in a vaguely serious movie. I give this only 9.9 out of 10 to leave the slightest of breathing spaces for anything even more improbable.", "simply the best": "There's no denying...the godfather is  the best movie ever. To get the maximum 'godfather effect', simply watch I, II and III on a potentially boring sunday afternoon/evening and you will be stunned, amazed and above all very confused, because this whole movie is a total mindtrip. Believe me, your life will never be the same again and if not so, at least you won't sleep that night because this masterpiece will hit you...VERY HARD.", "Words cannot express my feelings": "Within three hours, the group portrait is complete, and the characters are evenly shaded, and there are no idle strokes. Many scenes can be called great. The environment, sound, lighting, and props are integrated. For example, when the hospital changes rooms, the editing is too good and busy. He never forgets the tears around the godfather 's eyes, which is suitable for movement; for example, the clip of baptism and killing is a thrilling one. The second generation of the godfather gradually sublimates and freezes in the intersection of joy and cold blood.", "A good movie, however not worthy of its top ranking": "When a prestige movie is made, utmost attention is given to detail, grandeur, style, and above all, popularity.  Godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of Mario Puzo, who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster/mobster.  Capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable: to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls, and that they are certainly not invincible.  This movie was what it was meant to be, a prestige movie, it took very few risks, and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters.I found the Godfather to be a very well done movie.  In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much that I have watched it on many occasions.  This movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me, and it tells its story very well.  However, I do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the Top 100 ranking.  The highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee.  The godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies.People go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives. To be transported to another world, life, place, or perspective.  The godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement.  Not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves.  There is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real, and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away.  To those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies, the Godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time'.Movies such as Moulin Rouge, Citizen Kane, Requiem for a Dream, the Matrix, Casablanca, Momento, and even (depending on the viewer) Gladiator, all grasp the viewer by their hair, and thrust them into another world, if for only a few seconds.  The movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world.  It leaves us in a feeling of awe, and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie, but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen, and in some unique cases, a journey into the great depths of our own minds.  With this sort of depth and greatness, these types of movies should be all in the top 10.This unique greatness is not easily achieved.  In order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way, a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie.  The climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie, and should thus create a `climatic experience', thus blowing the viewer away.  The Godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking.So it is therefore obvious that The Godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies, and so it is not deserving of its top ranking. If it were up to me, I would move the Godfather down to 5 or 6, and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated.This movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10", "why is it #2 on imdb? it deserves #1": "Marlen brando and el pacino are brilliant actors for sure, i can't describe how deep their characters are. I don't recommend anyone to watch this because he will never find a movie like this movie again.", "While I prefer part II part one is still phenomenal (spoiler)": "The Godfather is the first and arguably the greatest of The Godfather trilogy with excellent acting on all parts most especially that of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The films excellent portrayal of Mafia's during the 40's and the transfer of power between Vito and Micheal which is eventually well summed up in part II (Which if you haven't seen I would highly recommend it.) While The film may not have all the action and cool tones of Goodfella's (which I very much so enjoyed) The godfather is clearly a better film with a much more fascinating plot and classic moments. The Godfather is a film where I would make no changes whatsoever weather it be acting or story the film is essentially perfect. I would recommend this film to anyone regardless of their taste in film.", "Sorry for a harsh rate but I dont usually let film popularity to influence my opinion.": "Sorry for a harsh rate but I dont usually let film popularity to influence my opinion.I give always a movie a chance and this didnt happend with this film.First off all. I was already let down by the begining. Half and our I had to watch someone Italian like wedding, another wedding maybe 5 min. I hoped that after the Godfather intruduction things would go intence or something. But to me nothing really happens...its kinda quiet, slow and just blah. Godfather ends up in hospital first half of the movie, Im like what now. Had to watch bunch of side characters who I did not care about really.The whole movie should be like the 15-20 minutes of the movie ending. I feeled the power of the actions what were made. I cant give a good rating just because they did ending well. Maybe the second movie is be better if Al Capone character stays strong as it was in first movie.", "really amazing": "the godfather is easily one of if not the best film in cinema history everyone gives great performances easily Marlon Brando and AL Pacino Frances ford Coppola directs the film well and everything is great the story is great and so is the film the story is convincing and many iconic performances and lines are featured James Caan and Robert Duvall give great performances the godfather truly deserves to be on the top of the greatest movie lists the plot interesting and manages to keep you watching throughout the film summary a stunning masterpiece that has changed movies forever and is easily going to be remembered forever the godfather is easily the best of the Trilodgy and was better than the best film of 1972 it could be the best film ever made the godfather is also good form watching before the godfather part 2", "nah": "Dude it's not that good.

That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino):\n\"Don't ever take sides against the family.\"", "The son of a Mafia": "The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn \"Godfather\", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed.

My issues with this film are multiple ...The pacing of the film is just terrible it's soooooooo slow and yet at the same time rushes through many things leaving many questions unanswered.Character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to Michael Who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in- between .The relationships are also poor - one minute Michael is in love with Kay the next minute he's in Sicily and, in what feels like 5 minutes, married to Apollonia, then about 5 minutes later she's dead and he's home and married to Kay before Apollonia corpse is even cold...Smaller issues include the fact that Michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year - either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married. Also would have been nice to know what happened to Connie after getting beaten up by her husband - clearly she must have phoned Sonny I assume.... Did she lose the child ?... Or is that the child that Michael was godfather to - if so where did Michael's 4 year old son come from.... I guess I was asleep when that was explained or maybe I'd just lost the will to live.

Followed up by two good sequels, the 1972 first film was the best. If we could have understood Marlon's mumblings it might have been even better! Al Pacino is terrific as young Michael Corleone, youngest son of Don Vito, played by Brando, who, all kidding about his dialogue delivery aside, gives an astonishing portrayal of a crime kingpin, a loving family man, a shrewd businessman and a loyal friend but a murderous enemy. My favorite performance, though, is James Caan as the fiery, hot tempered big brother, Sonny, Who is riddled by Tommy guns at a toll plaza ambush by rival gangsters. John Cazale is Fredo, the middle brother, who's not nearly as sharp or ruthless as the rest of the family. Talia Shire does very well in a pivotal role as the Don's only daughter, Connie. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the family consigliere, Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and legal adviser. Diane Keaton is very good as Kay, who will enter the family as Michael's wife, and discover the less appealing aspects of her husband and his family business. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are both exceptional as the godfather's lieutenants. The plot is well documented in other posts, so I won't recap it here. The thing to remember is that all the people depicted are either criminals or beneficiaries of criminal activities, while they often show virtues, they are corrupted by money and power. This is a complex and moving film, filled with great lines, unforgettable characters and action.

After his daughter's wedding he refuses to make a deal with a new drug lord in the area, which leads to him getting shot by a rival family, who is now in a deal with the said drug lord. Following these events, the youngest son of the family (Al Pacino), leaves his civilian status and joins the Mafia, becoming involved in the ever-going family business, made of violence and betrayal.Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, the lighting and cinematography are the first things that you notice throughout the film. The use of light and shadows, combined with precise framing makes this film unique, almost like Francis Coppola adopted a different style for this particular film. The menacing sound track makes sure to put the viewers on edge, seemingly making the protagonists even more menacing and scary in the eyes of the audience, as the mafia should be like. Being one of the best performances of Al Pacino, the aesthetic of the film only adds to the dark world of mafia orientated New York.The film itself is a good illustration of the post-war America in 1945 to 1955, so if you like me, are a sucker for post war America, you'll be pleased by the film's look at the very least.Follow us on instagram!\n@film_liquet", "Best movie through all times.": "The heavy storyline from \"The Godfather\" by Mario Puzo couldn't be better.

I have to say though, that I am one of those fans who has to put The Godfather I and the Godfather II on the same plate. They are equally my favorites and they are equally done to the same degree. Although II has its perks with DeNiro speaking Italian for most of the film. It's great. Memorable moments in the first one though are the entire film. Rarely does a movie come along where the entire film is memorable. Even the small scenes. I can truely say I love it. I never get tired of it. As a Italian-American growing up w/parents and relatives who memorized the movies, it is great to finally acknowledge them and say that Godfather is the best!", "An absolute masterpiece of the craft": "What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned from people countless times? This film is so beautifully woven and is a perfect example of a flawless film. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't experience this holy grail. I watched it for the first time in cinema due to the 50th anniversary release and was completely subdued in the story the 3 hour runtime went by so fast. Some people say that slow pacing is a drawback but for this film it's the total opposite. The pacing just really lets the audience feel apart of this family and like you are actually there on the dark paths that ensue my favourite example being the end shot of the door closing shutting out Kay and us, leaving you with a feeling of awe, intrigue and frustration as you want to see more of this world Coppola throws you in.The cinematography is so well done, especially the low key lighting and longer takes in important scenes. The performances are some of the best I've seen. Brando's, Pacinos, Keaton's all superb but Cann's is just so powerful and evocative you can't help but really feel all the emotions and depth he brings to Sonny. My favourite aspect to this film though has got to be Michael's turn from an average distant son to Vito's successor it's just wonderful to watch it happen. The best scene to exemplify this for me is the restaurant scene where a key turning point occurs which acts as a catalyst for the rest of his forceable actions.To conclude I definitely recommend this film to everyone and is a must watch.", "good, but...": "The Godfather is a good movie.  That's where it stops.  It is not a great movie in any way.  Marlon Brando gives the worst performance in the movie, being at best pedestrian in his role, and at worst immensely boring. (Laurence Olivier should have won the Oscar for Sleuth or Peter O'Toole for The Ruling Class) Mercifully, the supporting cast was excellent - Duvall and Pacino especially.  Caan was good as Santino, but suffered a bit in overacting his rages.  Part of the problem with this film is the book it came from - the book is about 450 pages long, and has a complete story for just about every character on screen.  Unless Coppola wanted a 10 hour movie, he just couldn't do that, which I understand.  I'd read the book shortly before seeing the film, and I have a lot more respect for the book. I would like to see Part Two, given that a lot of people say it is better (I can easily believe that).  I gave The Godfather 8/10, because, as I said, it is a good, but not great movie.  Truly great movies include Life is Beautiful, The Professional and A Clockwork Orange.", "MASTERPIECE": "The Godfather is one of the best films in the history. No more comments.\nGo to the couch and see it for yourself. Enjoy it.", "Copolla's Masterpiece": "Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic, all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their \"adopted\" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from \"innocent\" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word \"Mafia\" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.", "An unsurpassable classic movie!": "Character portrayals are better than shooting techniques, but they have all been done very well. You can see the shadow of many modern gang team movies from here. However, it has always been imitated and unconsciously imitated, but it has never been surpassed.

Here I write as a spectator, who likes movies and that's all, giving only my opinion, based on absolutely nothing.I thought a lot about which movie I would choose to be the first. It would have to be an odd movie to say the least, and I found it.A film considered by many to be the best work ever made in the seventh art, The Godfather is a work of many layers, but I don't intend to go on too long.The work has several aspects, which work very well, and several movie moments that are interspersed and talk to each other, causing the viewer different emotions throughout the film.A very long film, with its story embedded in the film from start to finish. In short, this density of history requires the viewer to pay close attention, so as not to miss any details. Of all aspects such as the strong figure of Don Corleone, the family history that is tied up during the film, I believe that the most relevant aspect to deal with here is what is really at stake: The construction of the Godfather, who is Michael .In my view, this film portrays this character construction as being the godfather, and I suppose and hope that part II and III are respectively the middle and end of his story. If not, anyway, that was the clear impression the film gave me.For all the zeal and care I've seen in this film, and also for the fact that it's very old and so well built in every way, I allow myself to give this film full marks, hoping I don't get used to pushing that button too often.It's not business, it's personal.Rating: 5/5 - This film is a Masterpiece.", "Art imitates life": "This movie had actual mobster families involved in several movie decisions, such as removing \"mafia\" and \"cosa nostra\" from the script, as well as supplying the actors who played Luca Brasi and Johnny Fontane.", "An aspiring classic and one of the most memorable in cinema": "From a stand point, The Godfather is one of the most epic and flawless Movies to be ever made.

The plot of the movie is a little hard to explain because the movie misleads the viewer and goes somewhere else but little by little the pieces add up together. The story begins with a bunch of people coming to the mafia Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for some requests because \"The Don can't refuse an offer to a Sicilian on the day of his daughters wedding.\" At the wedding we are introduced the Corleone family which include Santino or Sonny Corleone (James Caan) the oldest of the family and the most hotheaded member, Fredo the second oldest who is a womanizer and isn't as smart as the other members of his family, then there is Michael played by Al Pacino who is a WWII veteran who comes to his sister's wedding with his girlfriend Kay and tells her how he doesn't want to become like the others in his family. Then is Tom Haygin (Robert Duvall) the non Italian character who was taken in by Vito Corleone as a son and become the consiliere (or head of legal affairs) and then there is of course Connie (The Don's Daughter) who is marrying a man named Carlo. The beginning of the story focuses on a famous singer Johnny Propane coming to Vito Corleone asking him for help to get cast in a film, soon Tom goes there and ends up \"forcefully\" making the Director accept Johnny Propane. From there things become a little difficult when Vito Corleone refuses to get in the business of narcotics with a heroin dealer named Virgil Sollozzo. After Vito's refusal he is shot and nearly killed when his shot down by Sollozzo's men. Without much hope Tom is taken hostage and tries to get hotheaded Sonny to take a deal with Sollozzo but when he refuses things become worse as a possibility of an all out war with the other 5 heads of family become visible. Then Michael takes his role in the story when he visits his father and realizes their isn't security before he is beaten by the corrupt Captain McCluskey. After the incident Michael offers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey who they realize are working together and in a climatic scene Michael takes out a loaded gun and kills both McCluskey and Sollozzo. Without any hope Michael is forced to move to Sicily to be safe guarded for a while. There he meets a girl named Apollonia and she is soon killed in a car bomb in a near assassination on Michael's life because of the crime's he's committed. Things start to fall apart as the Don finally returns home and Sonny goes on to beat Carlo after he beats on his sister Connie. However when Carlo beats Connie again, Sonny is aggravated and goes to beat up Carlo again before getting murdered at a toll booth by an army of gunmen. After the death of Sonny, Vito Corleone decides to go with the five heads of the mafia to make a truce, soon Michael returns now that it's safe and returns to Kay his girlfriend and tells her he wants to marry her. With Sonny dead, the Don almost retired and Fredo in Vegas (being incompetent to take care of family affairs). Michael soon reduces Tom's power and makes Carlo his right hand man when they move their operations to Nevada. When visiting Vegas, Michael goes to a casino which is financed by The Corleone's and run by Moe Greene where Michael tells Moe that he plans on buying him out much to his dismay. Later Michael returns back home where he talks with the Don and the Don tells him that an associate close to him will betray him and kill him. Soon after the Don plays with his grandson (Michael's son) he dies of a heart attack. During the funeral Michael discovers that Tessio was the traitor and soon has him along with Moe Greene and the heads of the mafia all wiped out during the baptism of Connie's child. Afterwards Michael goes to Carlo's house where he questions him on Sonny's murder before wiping him out. The movie ends with Connie angry at Michael for Carlo's death but Michael seems not to care and when Kay asks him if this is what he does for a living, Michael tells her he doesn't. However it's obvious she realizes that Michael is becoming more what he was afraid of.", "Best Mafia Movie and a contender for best of all time": "It goes without saying that this is a classic for the ages. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Mafia Godfather Don Corleone is one of the if not the best performance I have seen from an actor in a movie. When you add the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and so many other amazing supporting actors & Movie Magic truly happens. I felt like I was in New York at the height of the Sicilian/Italian Mafias reign the first time I saw The Godfather and am still captivated and entertained every time I watch this Movie. Mario Puzo is a wonderful writer and Francis Ford Coppola really knows what he is doing behind the camera this is the perfect storm a great movie making.", "Great film, very dramatic, great performances!": "This movie has the right to be #1 in the top 250 from IMDb. Meta's have given it a 100/100 rating and the users have given it a solid 9,2. This film has been made with exceptional eye for detail and great artistic performances. You have to listen very well and keep concentrated every second of this film, because everything seen and heard appears to be a vital bit of information. It is the best movie ever made, with some of the best actors to have ever lived. Marlon Brando is a triple-A class actor and he shows it in this masterpiece. This is one of Al Pacino's first movies and he definitely left his mark, his performance has opened many doors for him, but most of all, it made the best movie ever!", "Awesome Movie": "I really enjoyed this movie and I love everything with this movie!!", "Work of art": "Among the all time greats for sure.

I was a student back then at Arizona State and I had heard about it from others shortly after it was released. At first after seeing it for the 1st time I thought the Don was wicked....then after seeing it several times he was actually protecting his loved ones even though he was in criminal activities yet many of his moves were handing out needed justice that the courts did not provide his fellow Italians with in NY. I saw the strong family values in him yet it was hard for me to realize his was a dark career. He created his own empire from zero having got off the boat all by himself as a very young boy after watching his family murdered in Italy, but what he saw from that was what raw power could do for a person from what that Italian Don had done to his own family. I think it internally made him gain same type of absolute power yet try to use it with fairness in family and related situations. He was not a wild cut throat Don.....there was honor in his power and we all could see it. Wonderful movie of an immigrant coming to America all alone and with perseverance and actual self preservation rise to power his people and lead them through then American tough times for most. He not only won the battle....he won the war as he saw it.", "the greatest film of all time": "Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).

A well deserved film. Brando's brilliance is showcased within The Godfather. Al Pacino is a the seed that is placed within the story, who continually grows throughout by the light of his father. Although, some seeds are worth pulling. The undertone of the story is the concept of corruption and the fall of an empire, and a start to a new one. Fracis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, an everlasting mark on American Cinema. Definitely a piece of history, and you're along for the ride, and experiencing the visceral feeling of that era.", "Very Overrated": "This movie is not as good as it is made out to be and very long. Most of the scenes seem unnecessary and make the movie overly long and boring.", "An Icon": "At once an observant homage to crime films of the Thirties and Forties and a loving portrait of an Italian-American family, Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's superlative novel (Puzo also co-write the script) is an achievement few films can hope to approximate. Coppola, along with his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, and his production designer, Dear Tavoularis, have created a history wholly realized, burnished brown as if a memory that will never completely fade. The world of the Cosa Nostra they present is closed and stuffy which provides an intimacy that generates an extraordinary amount of warmth and a feeling of lives being affected. The cast is flawless: the actors, to a person, inhabit the characters with such understanding and affection that they will be forever associated with them. (Al Pacino as Michael in the trilogy will never be able to match this work elsewhere.) But it is Marlon Brando in the title role that delivers such devastating work that you can only sit and stare in wonderment. Brando has a presence wise beyond his years and his gentle, thoughtful manner is never once betrayed his calculating, violent acts. Every movement, every vocal inflection is detailed and planned but he offers a spontaneity that never reveals technique. Guided by Coppola's abiding dedication to realism, Brando pushes this film to icon status. Not to be missed.", "good film": "This is a greatest film i ever seen. This film tells the life of an extraordinary gangster. There is a little violence but the storyline is amazingly good.", "Oldie but a Goodie": "After finally watching this movie, I have to say that it was a little over the place with its plot. I feel as though the movie was trying to focus on too many things at once. The character build could of been better. For its time I can say that this movie would of been the best, but for 2021 and all the movies I've watched this movie doesn't even crack top ten IMO. I would watch it again with maybe my GF or brothers but wouldn't go out of my way too.I really wish they had more character build in this and gave me more of an understanding of everything. I understand that the movie would of been too long but they rushed it.", "The movie that changed everything.": "\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\". Simply stated, but it's a line that echoes far beyond the screen, and deep into film legend. 'The Godfather' is often touted as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to understand why. Francis Ford Coppola, out of his depth for much of the production, has undoubtedly filmed more than just a movie, but a timeless portrayal into the heart and soul of a powerful mafia crime family. The Corleone family, headed by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, has risen to the top of the mafia pecking order in New York by not only by associating the family with politicians, but by strong family values kept in check with an iron fist. Just like politic's, a lot happens behind closed doors in the the world of a crime family, but unlike politic's, the consequences are much more severe. Not only did 'The Godfather' revitalize Marlon Brando's slumbering career, it put another's on the map. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, the Don's youngest and seemingly innocent son who has shown little desire to follow in his fathers footsteps. Pacino, who's status as one of the great actors has grown profoundly since his starting role, was a mere theater actor from NewYork and relatively unknown in Hollywood circles. But as the story grows and we see the Corleone clan come under threat from rival mafia families, Michael demonstrates through sheer strategy and cunningness the gusto to become the Corleone family top dog. While crime is the focal point of the film, violence is never far behind as we see the kind of ruthfullness required to reign in the criminal underworld. It's the little things that make 'The Godfather' the film it is though. The pasta sauce lesson from a Corleone family henchman, the cat in the study during the daughters wedding, all give the audience foresight into Coppola's grand detail and vision. 'The Godfather' with a scale of rich fullness rarely seen in films as brutal, not only holds the mantle of greatest mob movie of all time, but is also hailed as a turning point in the history of American cinema.", "Lost For Words...": "I honestly don't know what to say ... This has got to be the worst movie i've ever had the misfortune to watch and yet it's getting such good reviews. Why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me. Is almost everyone on IMDb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this? I found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it! My advice to anyone thinking of watching this - don't, it will only disappoint you. There is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging. Characters and events are boring to follow and personally I feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given.", "About the mafia underworld seen from the eyes of the Corleone Family": "This movie is perfect in every aspect of it, the script is to good, including lines that no script has ever equalled, and is true to real crime in the real world. The directing, producing of this is perfect, some of the best acting ever, the art directing is fantastic, costume designs fantastic, perfect is the word. This film is great to me because nobody had an idea like this one before the film, this film included great drama, not like other crime films which are just there for the explosions, and gun shoots. To me this film has the best ending ever, no ending has ever come near this one, maybe the second one came close, but nothing else. If you haven't seen this movie, and you're a big movie buff, I suggest you see this because this is the movie you can't refuse.", "A perfect movie": "I recently saw this in cinemas for the first time, andi was blown away. Every aspect was just incredible, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography. Its all superb.", "Spoilers from the entire trilogy": "When I watched this movie back in elementary school much of it didn't make sense. The only parts I wanted to see where the violent ones and there are a fair amount. Then I tried to watch the entire trilogy in middle school and I made until the third movie and it was too boring so I didn't watch it all. Then again in high school I decided to watch the trilogy fully and I finally understood most of the story. Except for the third movie which people say is the worst. I still don't understand the third one. The story just confuses me so much to this day. Most will argue that the second movie was the best and I do agree with it. By now that I think of it all I remember is that that movie was mainly about don Corleones up-bringing and how he met some of the older members of the family like clemenza and tessio. All in all it was a pretty good movie.", "Big movie!": "I had this classic on my watch list and it is certainly one of the best movies I've seen. What more can I say? That all production is perfect, music, actors without exception, history, etc. It does not bore and at all times keeps you aware of what will happen.", "great only beaten by part 2": "For me the 2nd best movie ever made. only godfather part 2 beats this, pacino is amazing in this film. the acting by brando is also amazing.", "The offer that you cannot refuse": "The Vito had shown his outstanding leadership in the movie. Quite learn a lot from him!Especially the quotes came out from his mouth. The bad-temper Sonny, weak Fredo and calm Michael have shown us the characters of human being. The godfather is not a easy job. He is a leader and must always take care to each other. He need to be fair and discipline.The traitors must be executed even though you are the family members.Really hard to be a godfather. By the way, I vote this movie 10 for the Marlon Brando!Thanks.", "overrated beyond belief": "I didn't care for any of the Godfather films.

Here in this film I am presented with two of the best movie gangsters. Brando and Pacino in probably the most influential movie ever.I need not tell how beautiful this movie is, as everyone who isn't under the age of 12 and living under a rock has seen this movie. The Godfather takes the Italian-American gangster and gives him something no film had managed to give him... Family Values. This film flows perfectly and if you do not like this movie than I suggest you return to watching dumb movies like The Benchwarmers for those who can't sit still and enjoy an actual movie with a plot, interesting characters, a well written script, beautiful cinematography, and great direction.This movie is close to perfect. There may be no such thing as a perfect movie, but there is a movie that comes close. This is one of them.", "The movie inspired me to become an actor": "What a great movie of all times according to me. It's simply a masterpiece. Loved every bit of it. Great performances by marlon brando and al pacino. It was soo real.", "Overrated film": "One problem I have with the godfather it lacked tension cause I was pretty bored throughout the whole film. Nothing really going on in the movie that capture my attention maybe beside the one scene where Al pacino gf died in a car explosion. Im all for dialogue between characters if done right but this one I can't see to engaged by it due to director bad directing in the movie. The camerawork has big part of the movie being boring cause the director use the basic camera work back and back forth on the face when having the conversation between the character as opposed of thinking of new camera angel to get the audience engaged by the dialogue. The characters talking in the movie is like how someone talk in quiet place that has no energy and no personality which failed to engage when we watch it. If I want to watch that, I will listen to my parents in a conversation when we eating dinner which will be more entertaining. Also all characters have no personality, their just so egoistic an narcissistic that it's hard to root for them. The movie is just lifeless dull so I don't get why it's considered a masterpiece to cinema .", "The term \"mafia\" is never used": "Possibly my favorite movie, this is an unsurpassed gangster film and well deserving of the universal praise it received.  It scores a 10 in my book, not surprisingly, but I will include what I consider to be some minor flaws. First and foremost, the kindheartedness of Brando's Vito Corleone character is extremely misleading.  I don't believe that any mob boss of that era, or even today, possesses anything but heartless greed for money and power. The viewer is left thinking that Vito is warm and gentle and had no choice but to enter the life of crime to support his family--bulls**t! The sequel (another gem) tries to explain this, but I still don't buy it.  Also, I don't think James Caan was cast well as the hot-headed Sonny.  He looks about as Italian as James Cagney.  His acting is superb, but I think someone like Robert DeNiro (who also auditioned for the role!) would have delivered a far more accurate portrayal.  On that note, it also struck me that Richard Castellano, who plays Clemenza, could have just as convincingly played the Don as Marlon Brando and, perhaps, saved the producers millions. Brando is, of course, phenomenal, but I think it's important to point out that the less recognized co-stars are comparably as talented.  Aside from this, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.", "What a MASTERPIECE!!!!!": "Oh my god this movie is a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola!! I'm gonna see this movie a few more times!! Go check it out someday it is so good!", "Reality": "The movie just mirrors the difficulties of gathering and handling power.

This is a shame, because quite possibly it might have got more interesting towards the end - but it did not retain my interest for long enough.

It should be the day when it is all about getting together with the family and enjoy the just married couple... yet Don Corleone has some business to attend to, and during this wedding he offers his help to many people, who needs justice the hard way. Vito Corleone has under-the-table-deals which are just as important to him as protecting his family. The opening scene is about twenty minutes long, where the Godfather setting is established. The raw criminal life of gangsters who must take care of the family as well as the family business. A great bunch of stories are entwined in this movie - stories about family(especially father and son), tradition, criminal life, power, all perfectly combined into one great story about the Godfather. It's well instructed, especially the scene where the Corleones are killing the leaders of the 5 families... it's a robotism, but with the sad church choir music and all the killings going on at the same time, it all seems pretty much like a requiem... Marlon Brando's performance as Vito is outstanding but so is Al Pacino as the son Michael. The movie is filled with great acting which includes Robert Duvall's work as Tom Hagen. The greatness about the Godfather is, that it's a perfectly combined story and very well directing as well! Francis Ford Coppola knows exactly how long a scene should last in order to give all the actors the time they need to show how they master their roles. This is not boring, but on the other hand very exciting as it gives the movie quite an artistic perspective. It goes from being a great movie into being beyond great.. It's a cultural and intelligent masterpiece that takes a lot of patience though but what art doesn't require patience?.... bad art!", "flawless": "I finally set out to take three hours to watch it this movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing The accents are amazing in this movie It is simply a great movie with great actors and great director I did get a little bored here and there it's too long But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever", "The puppeteer": "At three different occasions, i tried to watch this whole movie, this was about 4 years ago.. I don't know maybe i was too young and impatient, but at every single try i never got through it, and i wanted to get through it all because everyone loved it so much and it had good rating and reviews. A few days ago i had to watch it, the whole movie, 3 hours. At first i was thinking \"oh sh*t\", but i just had to get it over with. The performance of these two as i saw as main characters, Marlon and Pacino delivers an outstanding performance in adjusting to their characters battles as well in handling their emotions progressively. If we focus on Marlon his character i believe not many people could pull off, you can see that he really is stuck in this character, he looks worried constantly and troubled but at the same time a bit calm and bitter. His accent make's him even more interesting and the way he talks jagged tone. If we take a look at Pacino's role, I'd say this is irreplaceable as well, from the beginning who is a bit innocent and tries to not get involved, but the exceptional we see further on about his character evolves to this emotionless devil. What is so fascinating about this movie is how one person behavior is changing as the person itself goes through violence, sorrow and grief, what these situations turns a person in something he least wanted in this world. But as he goes through it, it becomes like nature to him, it's like it was in his veins from the start, he just needed it the keep spreading like a disease throughout his system. This is what is so bizarre until the very end, to wonder how he got so emotionless. I've never liked movies that were all about the Mafia, because i've never liked their motives. Which in the end it's all about money, respect and family, but this was something different.", "It is so unic, that every time i see it, i find something new.": "My story with the Godfather started as a growth man, in fact i watchet it for the first time at the age of 21. I'll never forget when the credits rolled over and the music started play. A feeling i have only experienced a couple o times.Everyone knows the plot, so there's nothing i can say about that. The only thing i can say about this piece of film making that has over 50 years old, is that we never ever saw anything like it again, simply because there is nothing that can beat it, is the perfect story, the perfect cast, the definitive screenplay. And that's it.So, whenever someone ask you wich movie you can recomend to others, it doesn't matter the kind of film they expect, this will be always your first recommendation, if there is such person in the world that has not seen this masterpiece yet.", "A must watch !!!": "I loved the series of the films. when someone asks me what to watch the first thing that I tell them is to watch godfather. i will never get tired of watching this movie.

From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.The Godfather revolves around the Corleone's, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone's is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn't want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo's, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo's drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don's oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It's fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola's first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. This film should be immediately followed up by it's sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They're both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won't be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven't seen this movie yet, it's about time you did.

Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and the rest of the cast has brought to life one of the most acclaimed film of all time.  The popularity of this film is not surprising because it contains memorable music, moving scenes, thought provoking dialogue/phrases and extraordinary acting by an extraordinary cast.  At the risk of sounding redundant, which in the case of giving thoughts about this movie is a given, it is so much more than what it seems storywise.  If I try to even explain this aspect of the movie, I'd lose myself.  This film is important to so many people that I recommend it to anyone that haven't seen it (which are some very unlucky people I might add).  Unfortunately, no simple explanation could ever compensate for the experience of watching Don Vito Corleone and His Family's Tale of Crime and Family.

If you do not want to see the perfection, see Scarface, Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and the other better mafia films, and leave Godfather to the end. It is easy to underrate other great films after watching Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola made a deep research before setting up the scenes, and discussed every single detail with Mario Puzo. Two masterminds created the most unforgettable movie in the galaxy. Paramount must be proud of their son, Coppola who had an amazing era in the 70's when made a bunch of memorable pictures in a row like Patton, The Conversation or Apocalypse Now.10 OUT OF 10 or 5* out of 5*", "Not the greatest film ever made, but still incredibly solid": "There's so many perfect executed scenes through The Godfather that it can be easy to underrate how nicely shaped the movie is, sometimes too overblown in that Coppola manner, but the transition between generations and with that capitalist periods is achieved with the precision.The movie is at its best when it goes all in its notions of tribalism and how they contrast with Pacino's Michael for whom so much of it is mere an easy excuse, his disconnect from his family beyond an ideal (outside of those scenes after his dad gets shot even those have a performative dutiful quality) give the movie most of its emotional stakes. Blood relations justifies murder and by the end that's really the only function it has.Duvall probably gives the movie most all-around performance because he is the only for who the mantra \"it's just business\" really applies, Coppola strains a lot to make the movie large political observations, but they most work on his scenes as he has such a solid mix of people pleasing skills keeping everyone relaxed and constant annoyance that the work has to deal with so much gangland hits and horse beheadings. My favorite bit about the film climax is his final scene with Vigoda because the latter sells the desperation that plays strong against Duvall's annoyance that the matter must be dealt at all, it is no coincidence Coppola treats it as a privileged moment in the middle of fireworks effects that dominate Michael's large vendetta.I must say I don't particular care for the movie final scenes, it mostly seems to die alongside Brando, not because he is the center or even the main attraction, but after that it seems happy with just performing Michael supposedly damnation and the scenes that related to that are the movie phoniest parts, it would take part III for any of Michael's damnation to achieve some human dimension beyond a rhetorical gambit that lets the audience more off the hook. Pacino's performance is at his best when it is clearly the Michael gets a kick of power and as a whole The Godfather is less about America or capital than it is about corruption and how seductive and awesome it truly is (one might of course argue all these three things are inseparable in Coppola's conception, but one of them take primary interest).I'm less crazy about Coppola's Viscontian aspirations than most, but The Godfather do get a lot of its shifting between the grandiose operatic nature and the smaller bits of business that give it foundation like Michael desperation trying to get the gun or even better the baker tension at playing bodyguard a bit early or the split second Fredo understands Michael is really there to make his Vegas vacation over.My favorite Brando bit in the movie is his scenes with Lattieri and I think it is mostly how Lattieri is the only actor who treats the movie as pure pulp so he gives Brando a different energy to bounce off. Their scene is about contrasting ideologies on the business, but it exists completely on the moment as a very specific thing and not discourse and that gets through some of Brando more mannered tics. By the same token, I love Sonny's execution or earlier his beatdown of Carlo because they seem like they could come from an Italian Godfather knockoff from two earlier later, I don't think the movie would be half as memorable if it was all like that, but I do think it would also be much worse if Coppola's just settle for the Hollywood wannabe arthouse film that it often gets praised as, the body of the gangster flick remains there and a lot of thrills are cheap.That's also probably why the thing I take the most out of The Godfather are the parade of character actor faces just going through their beats, the fading stars like Conte or Hayden who are there for their associations, but all those less well known Italian American guys (Castellano, Vigoda, Lattieri, Rocco, even Cazale who really gets surprising little to do, but who every reaction seems perfect).", "This film is a bad influence on people": "Money or materialism is the embodiment of human greed and the way the gangsters go about their lives, breaking laws and committing barbaric animalistic acts of terror just for money is a poor cultural showcase to people around the world. I give it a 3 out of 10 as the characters at least dress well and have some sense of professionalism though twisted as it is.The plot is actually quite simple and basic for a movie with such a high rating, there's a few thought provoking lines but other than that it's just the case of lawless organisations pitted against each other for the sake of money so if a mindless violent movie obsessing over money obsessed gangs is your thing then go for it and cheer your heart out for the amounts of money the rich mafia firms you imagine stole or received.", "Damn Good": "To be honest, I approached this film with an air of apprehension after being told by everyone that it was a masterpiece. I didn't want to like it at all, and the fact that i ended up loving it is a testament to the director.The movie was incredible. Seriously. Marlon Brando was stunning and Al Pacino an inspiration. The nature of their performances should send this film into the history books, as well as those of James Caan and Diane Keaton. From an actor's POV, splendid, and the plot kept me hooked for the majority.Key word: MAJORITY, as good as it was, I didn't pay complete attention for the whole thing. That aside, incredible movie. The genre has been done better recently in American Gangster and The Departed (Scorsese, legend, and as good a director as Francis Ford Coppola) but this is a true testament to American and Italian cinema. If you don't watch it, you're a closed minded idiot. No offence lol.", "An excellent crime film": "I absolutely loved this movie. It offers a unique view of the mafia and its workings from within the organization. It shows them as real people, not the heartless, emotionless criminals everyone makes them out to be. They aren't petty thugs like most criminals you see running around today. The Godfather is unique because it shows these criminals as having a sense of honor and dignity. Everything done is strictly business, nothing more. It has plenty of action and drama to keep me wanting more. Something about the way this movie is done, the way the actions are done out, the way the mafia is portrayed as operating, keeps me coming back to this movie, keeps me wanting to see more. I absolutely love this movie and will watch it again and again.", "A vastly over rated movie": "Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to \"Goodfella's\" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Godfather\" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the \"Gladiator\" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies. \"The Godfather\" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create.", "The \"God\" of All Films; A Cinematic Triumph!": "\"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.\" -Vito CorleoneThe Godfather is a great film, though #1 on the top 250 movie fan list, many people underrate it. I have heard many things saying that The Godfather is overrated, cheesy, and boring. I differ in so many ways. What The Godfather did for me was that it made me look at movies differently. It pretty much started getting me into classic films and I have so glad that it did that. The story is about a family of mob business where everything is going well. Once Vito, leader and father of the family, is wounded everything goes downhill. His son, Michael, kills the leader of the people who ordered his father to be dead, and then leaves town for two years. When he returns, the empire begins to fall and Vito retires.Filmmaking at it's best. Brando gives his greatest and most memorable performance, and probably the same for Al Pacino. James Caan and Robert Duvall also do wonderful in the supporting roles. I've given serious thought about what movie was the best of the 70's, and The Godfather definitely needs consideration. Francis Ford Coppola gives his greatest direction ever in every cinematic angle possible. Easily one of the 70's best.10/10 stars.", "A movie about mafia, human nature and power": "The Godfather is one of the most epic movie of all times, this story is about one family and how they can change the society to achieve they goals. More than it is how a familiar drama can change our personality, the mafia way of life is a background to find redemption for our personal decisions. The story shows how a average man become a leader, for good and for bad, the process is hard and cost tears, blood and a piece of our souls. We learn from this thriller that we can't control our destiny, and even our reactions to life challenges isn't full of ourself, in essence great part of our acts is just instinct. This is the main argument and lesson here, we can't make plans in the long run, but we can train to respond to new obstacles. In familiar and professional career our dreams always will be submitted to the reality.", "You can watch it .. but don't expect too much if you're from the younger generation": "If you like the genre, go watch it.\nBetter than the irishman.", "Memorable": "The most memorable movie i have ever seen. I could watch it with my family or anyone, if you're looking for the go-to movie. The godfather should be on your list!!", "**** (Out of four)": "\"The Godfather\" is one of the crossroads one must cross before proclaiming oneself a movie fan and a genuine movie buff.  Francis Ford Coppola's film is probably his most flawless, although it is NOT my favorite Coppola film (that honor belongs to the unmistakably problematic but highly visionary \"Apocalypse Now\").  Still, in the midst of a 90s cinema which seems to re-evalutate itself every five years or so with new computer-generated images and thusly cannot enjoy the same degree of timelessness of several earlier, better movies, \"The Godfather\" will undoubtedly hold its own as one of the most artistic endeavors in the relatively new medium of cinema.The story has been told many times before: based on Mario Puzo's bestseller, the film examines the aura of the Italian Mafiosi as exemplified through the Corleone family, led by patriarch Vito (Marlon Brando, an Oscar winner in a very professional bit of acting).  WWII-hero Michael (Al Pacino--the real star of the film as well as the real Best Actor of that year) comes home and breaks family tradition at his sister Connie's wedding ceremony not only by wearing his military uniform, but introducing his family to his WASP-ish girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), the epitome of modernistic feminine and Protestant intentions in the Corleone's traditional Catholic--and increasingly outdated--worldview.  The wedding scene is one of the great expositions of cinema, and yet the film lives up to all expectations by dashing us headlong into the Corleone's violent world.  Of course who can forget the severed horse head in the mansion of the luxurious Hollywood producer, the murder of Luca Brasi, \"sleeping with the fishes\", Santino's bloody murder at the toll booth, Brando's death scene, the intercutting between the baptism and the murders, and especially the final scene as the door closes and Kay realizes the deceit her entire life will become? To launch into a detailed discussion of Coppola's masterly filmmaking would take beyond 1000 words, so let me just echo the comments of many when saying \"The Godfather\" is that priceless canoli one should always cherish amidst the decaying corpses of escalating Hollywood trash.", "just read that": "So i just voted the Godfather 7/10.  But when I had to summarize it in that one line, i just couldn't do it.  It's impossible.  The movie has been so tainted and vandalized in the industry that it seems that it's impossible for one to point a finger on just exactly how they feel.Simply put: the Godfather is a good, solid, 3 star (out of four) movie. Yes, the experienced may have been ruined for me (i first saw it with a cold and didn't like it, so i had to see it later, as i knew something was wrong).  I also may be too young (all the commenters say you have to be over 18.  i say you could see the movie at ten and over).  But i feel the movie is a well written, well acted, well balanced movie.  What's the problem?  Again, I'm speechless.  It lacks a kick, that special kick that so many movies need to have.  Unlike its outstanding sequel, it fails to generate the feeling that the viewer is wrapped in it like a blanket, with the exception of a few scenes.  it best serves as an introduction to a legendary trilogy, rather than just a movie. \nBrando shines as a role that seems written for him, Pacino is great, Caan is head to head with his performance here and with his performance in the gripping Misery (3 1/2 stars out of four).  The script has some of the most realistic writing ever written.  It simply lacks the kick.If a person walked up to me and asked if they should see it, i would probably slap them in the face, ask what's wrong with them, and steal their lunch money.  But I would also tell them that before they see it, they should be ready to form their own opinion.  Now we come to the \"how it was ruined\" part.Hollywood generated and ego for this movie.  if you don't like it, or even have a positive opinion like me, you're automatically not considered a movie buff.  I applaud (and send my heart out to) all the movie buffs on imdb that get up off the ground, brush it off, lick their wounds, and say, \"look punk, i didn't like it.\"  It's important to form your own opinion, and i'm sure that there are plenty of people that go around praising this movie when they themselves don't think it was that hot.  I do, though, don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  If you haven't seen it, i suggest you should, though, only for the sake of seeing a so called classic.  That's it, for those of you looking for the last sentence sum up. Overatted, but still very good.  3 stars out of 4, 7 out of 10", "An immediate classic": "If you're Italian you will appreciate how Coppola got it right", "A classic movie": "A sensational film in its conception.

Only the desire of people to conform to public opinion, to admire everything that many people admire, and thereby allegedly bring themselves closer to supposedly elitist art. This happens not only with movies, I note, but also with musical works.

What can i say, the acting performances (especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino), the script, and the director's work, all were perfect.

Bull!": "Ok, I'll admit, I liked the Godfather, but #1 movie of all time?  That is sickening!  A good movie is not a movie that is \"fun\", if it was, then #1 would be a bad James Bond movie.

No doubt Francis Ford Coppola is best in making crime dramas and actors like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as two crime gods ,just\u2763\u2763\ud83d\udc4c. Every single scene of this film is like inspiration and self cautioning.If you haven't watched it yet then what are you waiting for .

I just think there are better films out there ones with more action, suspense,special effects ( i know it was low budget),actors etc. There just seemed to be more dialogue than anything else in the film put together. If you showed this to the younger generation then they would simply not be impressed. There are bigger titles out now and why is everyone still voting this in? It would be much better to vote the lord of the rings trilogy in the top 3 or put the shaw shank redemption at #1 that would make more sense. I would personally put \"The Godfather\" at #5 seeing as it does have the best title for a film of all time.", "Another one would be Great...": "If there is any classical movie out there, it would be, The Godfather. The Godfather showed how a movie should be, if it had family,business, and mobs.Vito Corleone is the Godfather, his family quote is, \"Do you spend time with your family?...because If a man douesn't spend time with his family, then he isn't a real man.\", that gave the audience, of how much the Godfather cares for his family.In the movie Al Pacino plays as Michael, his brothers call him, Micky or Mick. He plays a important role in the movie. His dad the Godfather dies, and he takes over the family business. There are 5 family mobs in New York, that the Corleone's are at war. Michael shoots a police officer and Sollozzo, they were in a Itailin Restuarent and Michael asked for permission to goto the restroom. In the restroom he gets what he needs to exterminate the two enemies, that were giving the Corleone Family trouble.After that, he traveled to Sicily for a year or more. There he found a wife to marry, but it didn't take to long to find Michael. They set a bomb in their car, which killed Michael's wife.The movie showed, great acting, and having it at the right time and mood. This movie is a masterpiece.If your in the mood for something delightful and enjoying, then you have yourself a movie. --A.Haynes--", "Masterpiece of the cinema": "It's hard to find bad aspects about this movie. It captures the mafia life perfectly, the actors are so good, the story is incredible and the drama is so fascinating that makes the movie extremely intriguing.", "Best film? Not likely... But it is filmmaking at its definite peek!": "I have seen many films far more ambitious in their scope and execution, I have seen more than a dozen films that made far more important statements about the world, and I have seen films that moved me far beyond anywhere The Godfather could have moved me.  But can the greatness of this film really be denied by anyone with even a vague knowledge about the filmmaking process? To call this film garbage is idiocy, there is no excuse, anyone who might make such a statement obviously has no clue about movies, even if they try to state otherwise.  Despite the fact that in many ways it glamorizes the criminal life, The Godfather is the peek of excellence in film.  It's a shame that people buy into the gangster formula created by Hollywood, it's a worse shame that people expect it, and when they do not see it they demand it!  This film breaks out of the formula, and it does so shamelessly, but it doesn't do it thoughtlessly.  There are truly excellent ironic statements all throughout the film, it surprises me that some people who claim to have some knowledge about film miss them.  The baptism that Michael Corleone attends is just one example, the shots of the baptism are juxtaposed with intercut shots of brutal killings taking place at approximately the same time, killings that were ordered by Michael as he took over the \"family business\".  It's a very powerful scene, almost revolting, it creates a very definite question mark as to the glamorous nature of the first part of the film.  Once again, this is far from the greatest film, but it's a definite 10 - there is no question about it.", "EPIC DRAMATIZATION UNIQUEISCENCE OF PERFECTION": "The storyline, screenplay and casting, couldnt have been any better.

Even if the viewer does not like mobster movies, he or she will watch the entire movie, the audience is glued to what will happen next as the movie progresses.

I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.", "Top movie of alltime": "The original Godfather is an epic that will live on in world cinema until the end of time. The only movies that come even close to its brilliance are Godfather II and The Usual Suspects. It is the most griping 3 hours of cinema you will ever watch. The acting is magnificent. Brando's whispering, hoarse voice is easily identifible to people even in the present day. Pacino gets started in his brilliant career with a memorable performance as Michael Corleone here. Even James Caan as the tempermental Sonny and Robert Duvall as the wannabe son are terrific. Francis Ford Coppola cemented his place in the Hollywood hall of fame with this epic that will never be forgotten.My rating : @@@@@ (out of five)", "The best movie I've seen in my whole life": "\"The Godfather\" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets.

In the beginning, Michael's intentions are honorable, and he does not intend to become involved \"in the family business\". However, the viewer soon learns that the apple does not fall far from the tree, and Michael inevitably follows in his father's footsteps, and becomes even more ruthless than his father, Don Vito Corleone.This film vividly portrays the ruthlessness of criminal organizations, and the price participants pay for involvement in a business that plays by no rules and never forgives betrayal.

I was really enjoying every minute of his screen time and because of his Italian accent and also because he was a very interesting and likable character. The amount of drama that occurs in the film between the five families is absolutely heartbreaking and mind-blowing due to FANTASTIC performances brought to the film!

I watch it when I was small and didnt understand, I think is like soap opera. But I watch it again, recently, and now I understand and like it very much.This movie is about how you can murder people and not get in trouble with police if you have a lot of power. If you have a strong family, you can murder other people, but problem is if the people you murder also have strong family. So if you are powerful, you dont have to worry about police, you have to worry about other people who also have power. I think this is very original and unique idea which you do not see in many movies. I think this is another movie about america.In this movie is one man who is young in beginning, going to weddings and parties. He is nice guy and maybe he wants normal stuffs. But then he goes to italy and people start murdering people more and more. And by middle of movie, he learns that you can murder people, and maybe he wants to also, so he murders a guy when they are eating pasta, and he never stops. After that he gets other people to murder for him. He goes to lost vegas and murders a guy there too because the guy doesnt have any parties like they wanted. Everybody like him more and more, or maybe they are scared of him, because he murders and so they start to kiss his hands at the end.It is interesting movie, I did not think about it before, but it is interesting how he only have to worry about other people with power who want to murder him, but he is not worried about if he will get in trouble for it.", "the first, and best": "At the time of its release, this was the best American movie since \"Citizen Kane.\" \"Star Wars\" has since exceeded it as a more influential movie, serving as a bridge between \"Kane\" and the future as did \"Kane\" between \"Birth of a Nation\" and the silents. But this is master filmmaking, sure to grip a viewer even on repeated showings.I saw \"The Godfather\" for the first time in 1973, after turning 18, and it marked the only occasion that I was \"carded\" at a movie. The dialogue borrows heavily from the book, but what source material! From \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" to \"Leave the gun; take the cannoli,\" this was inspired stuff. (In fairness, I must admit that Coppola and Puzo took the screenplay for Part II to an even higher level.)Brando's performance secured his place in movie history. Although his on-screen time is limited, he dominates in every frame that he appears. From a simple whisper (\"Where's Michael?\") on his sickbed to the scene where he peers at an aquarium while Michael conducts family business to the final scene in the garden, Brando becomes Vito Corleone and, like Clark Gable in Rhett Butler, is the only actor one can imagine playing the part so well. The transfer of power between Brando and Pacino in the garden, a scene written by Robert Towne (\"Chinatown\"), ranks with that in the taxicab between Brando and Rod Steiger in \"On the Waterfront\" as the most powerful in American cinema.What we have is a cinematic masterpiece, pulsating with excitement until the final scene, when Al Neri shuts the study door on Kay in the kitchen _ Coppola here paying homage to the final scene of \"The Searchers,\" as he would do also in the two sequels.I'm torn between \"The Godfather\" and \"Casablanca\" as my favorite movie. Perhaps the difference is that I saw \"The Godfather\" first, at an impressionable moment of my life. For me, no sequel was necessary. The first look at the Corleone Family remains the best.", "Without a doubt: the best story ever - the best film ever": "Not often you will be able to find a film that is as good as the novel it's based upon. For sure the reason in this case is that Mario Puzo also wrote the screenplay. Fully recommended to read the book and to watch the film, in either order. Any more comment needless.", "classic": "A must watch classic. Amazing character development. Legendary soundtrack. This movie can only receive 10/10. Everyone who loves watching movies, I recommend this movie to them.", "Didn't do it for me": "Now I understand that this film was groundbreaking... but it didn't do it for me. Marlon Brando was impossible to understand and the plot was so hard to keep a track of. It definitely got better as it went on but did seem to drag for a bit with unnecessary scenes it felt like it should've been a series. I didn't hate it in the slightest and will be watching The Godfather 2 however I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a captivating or lighthearted film.", "Best Film Ever?": "No.1 Movie of all time? I think that's what ruined it for me, I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours. Everything about it just lacked in moving me, the vengeance was untouched, parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched. Thoroughly this was the most disappointing film I've ever seen, not the worst, just the most disappointing. I'm not trying to change anyone's thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad - just in case anyone gets the impression. Thanks", "Don't Like Violence": "I really don't understand, and don't want to understand, why people are obsessed with this type of movie. Every violent scene makes me sick, and I don't want to go back to any of them. I even think that to treat such a film as a classic, even if it is highly skilled, isn't it secretly instigating more people to worship violence? Damn manly. It amounts to violence in some ways.", "The Essential Mobster Movie": "Besides romanticizing the idea of being a mobster, the movie marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new idea. The whole concept is the patriarch of this mobster family seeing the end of a profit for innocent leisure activities such as gambling and running molasses when new mobsters want in on the narcotics business which is just dirty business since it involves addiction and not just plain drinking and gambling. The viewer sees how the old ideals of the 1920s which are embodied with the Don conflict with the new ideals of the 1950s which is the business of narcotics. It is an epic of the Don's youngest son, Michael, how he refuses the idea of being a part of the family and how his love for his father forces him to be more ruthless and calm than his father and his brother, since he takes action right away by killing Solozzo and the police captain for being corrupt and to top it off kills off the heads of the five families just to solidify the Corleone family power. This is the essential mobster movie since solidifies the idea of an organized crime effort with the Boss, the Underbosses who are next in line, the Capo Regime and the soldiers modeled after the Roman Empire as mentioned in Part II by Tom Hagen. While the sequel is arguably one of the best sequels of all time, the original excels in showcasing how this mobster empire conflicted with new ideals but came up on top with nothing but ruthlessness and calm precision by Michael.", "Sorry guys, no part 4....ever!": "I am sorry t say that the commentary made by francis coppola at the end of part 3 on the DVD editon clearly states that for the last ten years of Mario Puzo's life they discussed a possible part 4 of the godfather, hoping that they could evolve upon the rise the corleone family business, as a whole. I.e.: how they gained political influence among society, how michael grew distant and how the rest of them drew close, and then skip 40-50 years ahead to vincent corleone losing the bussiness that was worked upon so hard to gain, through drugs and loss of all political influence and respect, whilst haunted by the loss of his cousin love, and ironically have one final scene with Michael and vincent before michael died. i.e.: this would be a part 2 narrative.This was majorly discussed, but time was not on puzo's side to write it, and francis refuses this to be done without puzo.One might say \"How about Scorsese?\" but lets face it, this was a coppola/puzo thing. Scorsese would take it off track like any other director, even someone like Speilburg couldn't do it!It's a crying shame as this seemed like an all time classic to erase the existence of part 3's disaster!", "No matter what I'm doing...if it's on TV..I'll sit and watch": "The first time I saw this movie in the theatre, I was 19, and so taken by it's theme, because there had been nothing like it before.

I immediately asked my Italian friends, if that could be possible..... they said...\"yes, in the 'old' days...not as many cops,and no forensic stuff available then to get caught!\" However, some things weren't realistic...such as...Michael's naive wife(Diane Keaton) constantly interfering(he would have gotten rid of her,long ago)and Sonny getting caught by himself, on the causway...you 'always' take somebody with you, (men can't avoid to be careless)...

I have not watched the sequel yet, but either way, I think we can't rank Part II as the best just because it's a sequel. But all acting is uniquely perfect. There were unbelievable twists and crazy violence for 1972, but I love it. There clearly is not a better movie out there.", "THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!": "The Godfather has quickly become this reviewer's favorite dramatic movie. With a mixture of love, action and scandalous plot developments not once in the 175 minutes of watching it did looking at the clock to see how much longer it would be come to mind.  There is such a sympathy created for the Corleone family that you end up rooting for them, even though they are a mafia related family.  It's crazy to think about really, for instance, this reviewer can't remember the last time she felt sympathy for a murderer\u0085  The Godfather is amazing, it's well written, and the cast just meshes well on screen.  The names can be confusing because they are all Italian and people address each other by their last name most of the time, but after a while it starts to make a little sense. \tThe lead character of the movie is, surprisingly, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  This story follows his coming of age from a young man wishing to get as far away from the business to his deep involvement after some family catastrophes.  Upon first introduction Michael is dressed in his service uniform and bringing a new love, Kay (Diane Keaton), to the wedding of his sister.  When Kay asks about his family, and his father in particular, Michael explains to her that his father is a mafia leader and he wants nothing at all to be like him.  So far, he had been doing very well at trying to keep himself separated, until one day when his father gets shot in the back several times and is put into the hospital.  Well, of course, the henchmen aren't going to be satisfied with just putting him in the hospital, they want to finish the job.  Luckily, Michael goes to visit his father and upon arrival realizes that there is no one there keeping guard over his father.  He calls his brother to get backup and places his father in a different room in the hospital.  The suspense in this scene is SO heavy it's almost suffocating, in a good way.  There are distant footsteps heard coming toward Michael's father and this reviewer felt her hands clench and her heart beat racing; it was so well done.  But this is the point when Michael really starts to enter the mafia; and he only gets deeper and deeper into it as the movie plays out. \tThere is, however, one death scene that is a bit too played out.  A character is in a car and suddenly there are a gazillion guys around the car and they all have rapid firing guns.  Well, the character is shot while in the car and proceeds to crawl across the seat and exit out the passenger side of the car.  At which point, the character puts themselves in full exposure to the henchmen.  Why?  No clue, but then another 70 or 80 shots are successfully taken AND THEN one of the henchmen proceeds to take a few shots at close range and throw in a few kicks.  This is a bit excessive upon reflection but at the time, this reviewer almost cried.  It was SO unfair! If it wasn't for the fact that it is completely impossible, jumping into the screen to save the victim was all this reviewer could think of.  Once again, it's amazing because the victim wasn't exactly an angel to say the least. \tThe story is truly what manipulates the audience to feel sympathy for this family.  They seem to be falling apart left and right, which is tough to see because they used to be such a strong unit.  The values of family love seem to be falling apart with each new marriage, the men are trying to stay ahead in the game but they keep getting attacked from behind because there are traitors amongst the alliances.  Personally, this reviewer can't wait to see the two following films in this trilogy and compare them to the first, because topping this one will be extremely difficult. \tIf your looking for an awesome drama, watch The Godfather, it's got a little bit of everything in the story for everyone.  It's a great movie to watch on an icky day when you're stuck at home, because it will make time fly so fast.", "Set the precedent...": "It's been a few years since I have seen this film, but it is definitely one of the all-time classics. I would give it a '10' but I find the length drags it down a little. Other than that deserving of belonging in the Top 250 films. However, I would not give it #1. I would have to reserver that honor for Sergio Leone's \"The Good The Bad and The Ugly\". \"The Godfather\" did give us some awesome performances, one of the only Brando roles I truly enjoyed. As well my 2nd favorite Coppola film (1st being \"The Conversation\").I think it's worth repeat viewing, and a definite keeper in a movie lover's collection. Bottom line a solid '8', with a desire to see it again soon.", "Great Movie...But Not Perfect": "I agree that The Godfather is a classic and one of the greatest movies of all time but it bothers me how many people think it is absolutely perfect. It is not perfect, but it still probably deserves the number one spot. It is definitely the best mob movie ever made, but I don't like how people live and die by it.", "Is The Godfather the greatest film of all time?": "No! But it is in the top five. The Godfather is the king of mobster and mafia films. It goes where no family has ever gone before. Marlone Brando is The Godfather, the head master of the family. His raspy voice is copied by people all over the world, but is never mastered. The Godfather is such a great film. But, I do warn you though. It's a long,long film. I think it's about 3 hours long. If you don't like sitting there for 3 hours watching a movie, then watch it hour by hour. It's a hard decision to make..if The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Some people say yes, others no. I say..and I stand by this..The Wizard of Oz is the greatest film of all time. Yeah, yeah, I'm picking Oz over The Godfather. The Godfather is #3 on my list, which is a pretty hard list to get on. You must watch this film. It's one of America's classics. This comments has taught me many this. It taught me..keep your friends close..and your enemies closer. That's in part 2..but, Hey! Who's keeping up?", "A Meticulously Manicured Mafia Masterpiece": "The Godfather is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Coppola's deliberate directing, coupled with a superb script, elegant editing, crisp cinematography, sensational score and potent performances contribute to a staggering cinematic experience. A Magnificent Mafia Masterpiece, dissecting the human desire for power and the fortitude of the familial bond; told with an intricate web of carefully weaved plot lines and meticulously motivated characters.The transformation of the character of Michael Corleone is one to admire. He begins the story as a celebrated War Hero; his military service serves as an indication of his desire to fight for others rather than his family. This disdain towards his family is later reinforced as he says to Kay: \"That's my family, Kay. It's not me.\" She is not the woman a traditional Corleone would be expected to marry - a modern American: self-providing and lawful. His relationship towards Kay is a manifestation of his desire for something beyond his family tradition. He does not feel any compulsion for familial responsibility.The shooting of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, marks the beginning of a rippling chain of events: As the news reaches Michael on a date with Kay, he is shaken; not just because his father is in a fatal condition, but also he feels that his father would not be in this condition if he had not been so selfish towards his own desires rather than his family's. For the first time in the story, Michael abandons his own desires to focus on his family, leaving Kay. This selfless action illuminates his budding loyalty towards his family, at the expense of a weakening relationship with Kay.Michael then visits his father in the unguarded hospital, where he is shaken by the potential danger that could befall his father. Compelled by a familial responsibility, he keeps his father safe against an assassination, a move that brings him closer to his father, and to the Corleones. In the Godfather's absence, the rest of the Corleones congregate in his office. In a hauntingly beautiful push-in, Michael chooses to be the one to shoot Sollozzo and McCluskey. The shouldering of this responsibility marks the pivotal shift in his character: the change from self-interest towards familial loyalty - \"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business\"The screeching sound of a train blares in Michael's ears as we approach the climax - With the pulls of a trigger, Michael has cemented himself among the Corleones, as the bodies of Sollozzo and McCluskey lie on the chequered floor.Michael is then cast to Sicily in exile. At the first sight, he is enamoured by Apollonia, the exact type of woman he would need as the Don Corleone: a Sicilian beauty steeped in tradition. Moreover, she is the kind of woman that the Michael at the beginning of the film would have disliked, which is why his love towards her highlights the great transition in Michael's character and desires. This serves as a striking contrast to Kay, who was the modern American woman he once desired, but would now be unsuitable as the wife to the Don Corleone. However, Michael's dreams of romance are incinerated as Apollonia bursts into flames of a car bomb intended for Michael. Sicily is no longer safe, and the future Don must return to America.One year has passed. Michael reunites with Kay, and in their conversation, Kay is struck at how much the Michael she thought she knew had changed, and surprised at how the man she once knew as diverging from his family tradition, was now aligning himself upon the path to the head of the Corleones. The response he has is: \"My father is no different than any other powerful man. Any man who's responsible for other people\", illuminating the fuel of Michael's actions to be the responsibility of his family.Coated in all-black, Michael echoes his father's characteristics as the coldly calculating head of the family business. He holds a haunting, menacing glare in his eyes as he threatens to buy out Moe Green's casinos in Las Vegas. When Moe denies this offer, claiming that the Corleone family holds no power over him, we feel the same dread for Moe as we did for the poor victims that dared to stand up to Vito Corleone. When Michael says that he will give Moe an offer he can't refuse, we know that there is a real menace behind those words.The droning hum of the church organ rings in our ears as we arrive at one of the most riveting scenes in the film. Michael's godson is being baptised, and the priest asks him: \"Do you renounce Satan?\", as we intercut to Moe Green and the four heads of the other New York families being assassinated, he responds: \"I do\". With all the threats to his family exterminated, Michael Corleone has asserted himself as a man of ultimate power.In the film's final scene, Michael's sister, Connie, confronts him regarding the murder of her husband Carlo; Kay is petrified at the prospect of him being a murderer, and at the thought of him succumbing to the unlawful family tradition that he once denounced. She inquires if he killed Carlo, to which he responds with a hollow \"No\". Feeling a false sense of relief, she leaves the room and - as she turns to look back at Michael, the door is shut on her as we see the caporegime kiss the revered hand of the new Don Corleone.Ultimately, I believe Michael's arc to be have been motivated by the responsibility of family. Initially, his family was in a respectable position and he felt no compulsion to shoulder any responsibility for his family - however, when his father was shot, Michael woke up to his own selfish desires and realised that the responsibility of the family should rest on his shoulders. This responsibility for his family is what drives Michael throughout the story, and I believe this is to be the main reason why we sympathise with Michael and the Corleones. They are not driven by greed or power, rather the primary desire behind their actions is the protection of their families. This is ultimately why I found the character of Michael Corleone to be so fascinating: He is a Man of Power, a quality associated with greed and evil, but he is driven by the responsibility of his family. The power he wields is then used for the love of his family; a beautiful dichotomy.In a conclusive note, The Godfather is a miraculous masterpiece. Every aspect has been refined to absolute perfection - and the result is an enrapturing cinematic experience. One of the greatest of all time.", "Damn good": "Truly the best movie of all time, except for perhaps Part II.  Marlon Brando is unforgettable.  Al Pacino as Michael Corleone- probably one of the better performances on film.  Ever.  The cinematography is gorgeous.

You'll put it aside and go cook something while it is playing in the background.Now, you gotta know these things before watching it:1) It doesn't really tell anything. It has a story, but it doesn't start and doesn't end. It's just there and it's honestly pretty boring. It has no purpose, no meaning. It's not interesting.2) You won't remember a single character a week after except the Godfather (Marlon Brando, he played great). All the other characters lack personality, motives, charisma, it feels almost like if they aren't existing. They are greyed out.3) It has a very, very, very slow place.

It is bloody and sad. It has a lot of themes and colors to describe the story, which is very interesting. If you really like this movie, I would recommend The Road to Pedition with Tom Hanks. It is not as bloody as this movie but it has a good plot. Godfather has a good plot but for me, it is just too much to handle. The movie would probably get away without so much blood but I guess you have to be realistic.

This is my first comment in this site and I hope it will be useful for other users... I love to see this movie again and again and it's like a text-book to film industry whether it's Hollywood or bollywood.", "The Greatest American Film Ever Made": "Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is perhaps the best gangster story ever told and the best film ever made. It's an enriching, engrossing, and evocative look into the criminal underworld in perspective of the Corleone family. This is also one of the rarest films to come out without any flaws. As far as it goes, The Godfather is literature for movie-goers and respectfulness for critics. It boasts legendary performances, excellent direction, a brilliant script, and a smooth, peaceful soundtrack.This film wouldn't have been this good if not for Marlon Brando's absolutely amazing performances as Don Vito Corleone. His character has gone down in history as one of the most sophisticated, yet graceful characters of Cinema. Brando is widely known today as the greatest actor that's ever lived. Al Pacino, is brilliant, if not perfect in this film. He plays Michael Corleone with a certain innocence, yet jealousy for all he's worth. This actor is also known as one of the best actors in the world. You would have to also thank an excellent supporting cast that includes people like Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is trustworthy and often rewarding, as he leads this film in the right direction. The sets and scenery are often beautiful and intriguing, which matches the silent tone of this film. Since this is set in very old periodic places, this is a great example of old New York and Italy. The greatest scene in this film involves only Brando and Corleone. It's a scene of such scope and emotions that it's hard to describe it.Even though this material is based on Mario Puzo's wonderful books, it's hard to notice it. The film is so fluent and straightforward, that it's hard to pick up any flaws or evident mistakes in this. The writing is nevertheless excellent and even though there's no narration, this film never leaves you bored.And last, the soundtrack by Nino Rota is quite something. It's a very smooth, soothing soundtrack that is based on Italian music. This is very original and never leaves you disappointed with itself.Overall, there's no doubt this is an examination of American classical Cinema. Completely flawless and highly recommended for any movie buff. If you haven't seen The Godfather, then I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse. See it and you will definitely adore it.", "Genius": "This is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen this and Godfather 2 over a dozen times! It's a timeless and perfect movie.", "Familia taking care of business": "One of the best thing about this film is the terrific performance of Brando asDon Vito Corleone. He created a character capable for transmitting themost ambiguous emotions. For one side, we have the loving father (and godfather of course), husband, grand father, friend. In the other hand he is one of the coldest blooded characters in movie history. \"It's not personal, it's strictly business\" is the perfect phrase to define the way of the \"Familia\" taking care of business related activities. There are several sequences that have become classic scenes: at the beginning of the movie we see a merciful Vito sitting in his \"throne\" deciding the destiny of dishonored fathers, Hollywood actors, rude bodyguards. \"Remember that some day I will ask another favor in return\". Don Vito is respected as a priest, his hand is kissed and he takes care of the situations one way of another. Religion is, ironically, one of the main characters of the history. Four major scenes are related with catholic rites: Two weddings, a funeral and a baptize. Italian costumes are essential as well. The family concept, the traditions; big dinners with pasta, meat balls and red wine. Concepts as honor, loyalty, vengeance are reminded consistently along the three hours. In another classic scene we visualize the \"familia\" way to solve some pending issues: Johnny, the favorite Vito's godsons is one of the hottest Hollywood stars hoping to obtain the leading role in a movie. The producer does not want him on the film for personal reasons, but at the end he accepts once he discovers his favorite horse head the next morning in his bed. Robert Duvall is the adviser, Vito's right hand and in my opinion the second best performance. He is responsible of dealing with the other families. He hates violence but justify every decision to use it. He is the conscience and a critical member, no matter if he is not Sicilian. Other sequence (I think the best) is where the big families have a meeting to solve their differences. Don Vito did not want to be involved in the drug business, he wanted to remain with the usual ones: gambling, liquor and unions. His relation ships with influent people are important to the mob environment. He agrees to permit the drug dealing and offers protection just with one condition: at this time his son Sonny (performed by James Caan) was brutally killed. He accepts his dead as a part of the business and he is willing to make a truce to stop the blood spill. In one of the best scenes ever performed by Brando he stands up and says (not literally): \"I won't revenge my son's death. Mike, my other son is hiding somewhere in Italy and he will return shortly. I accept the conditions to bring peace, but if my son is murdered in any way, shoot accidentally by a cop, have a car accident or appears hanging in his cell I will blame someone in this room\" an then he signed his agreement with a huge with his enemy. A good movie with excellent cast selection, including a good performance of young Al Pacino and his incidental transformation from war hero to new family Don. Coppola created a myth with his trilogy. The second part was actually better than the first one and this is much to say. The baptize sequence at the end is just extraordinary.

Commanding performance of entire cast, all dialogues are already written in silver line, epic scenes and marvellous acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, brilliant direction.", "What I expected, therefore perfect.": "Honestly this review is going to be short because this film is excellent in any field you could imagine - visually amazing, acting more convincing than any movie I've ever seen, the score is iconic and the screenplay is so vast in scale, but manages to be amazing. if you put the end of this movie next to the start, it wouldn't make any sense, but just as all great films, it makes sense anyway while immersing you into the cinematic experience. If you haven't seen, then you need to free up a morning or evening with or without friends and watch it with your undivided attention.", "Arguably The best Movie of all Time": "I have to admit, I was nervous going to this movie, what would it be if I didn't realize the quality and aspects that make this film one of the best productions ever? Turns out , I was immediately fascinated by how the slow and deadly pace and the calm and smooth interpretations contributed to the tension present throughout the story (an interesting contrast indeed).Coppola, through a simple, emotional and interesting story, represents with great skill the reality of the mafia: the schemes, the betrayals, the tragedies, the family ties... All this joined by a modest but absolutely brilliant cinematography.The characters do not owe anything to the story, the movie focuses mainly on three: Don Vito Corleone, an apparently cruel man, experienced head of the famaly, famous for his granting of favors; Micheal Carleone, son of Don Vito who doesn't intend to be involved in the family business but, ironically, is the only one with the profile and sense to take the reins of the Family; Tom Heagan, Don Vito's loyal Consigliere who values reason over emotion, which clashes with Mafia pride. The refinement with which these characters are developed and characterized demonstrates the quality of the film's writing.Also featuring remarkable performances (Al Pacino and Marlon Brando act with fascinating naturalness), an otherworldly soundtrack and iconic scenes and passages, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever and A must for any cinephile.", "It's The Godfather lol": "Go watch the movie, that's all I need to say.Now I'm gonna type the lyerics to Here There and Everywhere.To lead a better life\nI need my love to be here\nHere\nMaking each day of the year\nChanging my life with a wave of her hand\nNobody can deny that there's something there\nThere\nRunning my hands through her hair\nBoth of us thinking how good it can be\nSomeone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there\nI want here everywhere\nAnd if she beside me I know I need never care\nBut to love her is to need her\nEverywhere\nKnowing that love is to share\nEach one believing that love never dies\nWatching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there\nI want her everywhere\nAnd if she's beside me I know I need never care\nBut to love her is to need her\nEverywhere\nKnowing that love is to share\nEach one believing that love never dies\nWatching her eyes and hoping I'm always there\nI will be there\nAnd everywhere\nHere, there and everywhere.", "One of the most amazing films ever created": "The first time I saw this I was speechless. This is obviously the most excellent film ever. With a near perfect cast. A great Director. The music is one of the best things about it, I love the Godfather song. Almost every scene is unforgettable. A Perfect Film!!!!!!!", "THE MOST PERFECT MOVIE EVER": "The Godfather is not only one of the best and most memorable movies, but also one of the most beautiful movies in history.\nThe film, which is not only full of power struggles and betrayals, but also shows a family that is always behind each other.\nA father who, while being the biggest criminal in the city, loves his children so much that he is ready to kill the whole city by losing one of them, but for the sake of the other children, he forgives his son and finally dies playing with his grandson.\nAnd of course, in the end, his little boy takes revenge on the whole family in the best possible way and becomes the first power again.\nYou know, the godfather is a combination of blood and love.\nAnd if we want to describe it in one sentence, we can only say:\nTHE MOST PERFECT MOVIE EVER", "A truly epic masterpiece that was informative too": "This was a great film in every sense of the word. I loved it because it was so believable and everything that was done was most likely true. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan were excellent. Brando's voice, Pacino's youthful look, Duvall's innocence, and Caan's brutality all drew me in and it never bored me. In only his third film of his long and brilliant film career, I saw Al Pacino's attitude gradually change for the worst. First we see Pacino the war hero, then as he gets into the Corleone family business he becomes a changed man and starts to gain the right to put his two- sense in. I also saw the innocence of a young looking Robert Duvall that I felt compelling and most interesting to watch. Also, the way that all the scenes of violence were orchestrated I could tell it was accurate or Francis Ford Coppola and the rest of his crew spent time researching the accuracy and made it as close to accurate as possible. Everything about this film was disturbing and that is what made it so darn good because it was so true. As great as the Godfather series of movies were it is my opinion that the first Godfather could have stood on its own without making two more parts. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it. I also plan to rent the following two parts at a later date so I could soak this first part in.  Nine hours of The Godfather is a lot to take in at one time so enjoy this wonderful epic, but over time. My suggestion to people who haven't seen this film is to go and see it because no matter what type of film you enjoy, I guarantee you will like this one.", "Best Mafia movie": "I do not like old school movies, but it is my number movie off all times. There are certain things in life that are so exquisite that 26 Alphabets seem inadequate to adequately explain them. They go beyond the limited scope of the 26 alphabets. Instead of rating or reviewing such things, you should personally experience them. One of the most exquisite motion pictures and television shows ever made. I mean, if they were able to make such high-caliber films in 1970, which the most skilled individuals are unable to do so in 2021, then the folks who built and developed this were truly ahead of their time. It will be unusual to see this 1970s-created, 1950s-based sitcom in 2021. I have a tendency to screenshot the moments that would make the most stunning posters.", "A completely engaging melodrama that casts its net a little too wide": "For some years I have avoided getting around to see The Godfather.\nSuch is its reputation, one is afraid to spoil the almost mythical aura that surrounds the film by doing anything as pedestrian as watching it.     \nBut watch it I have, and it is now easy to see why this epic has captured the imagination of so many people. A sweeping family melodrama, it is completely engaging and replete with stunning performances from the cast.Nevertheless, the first-time viewer cannot help feeling a little cheated. So much is left unexplored, so many years glossed over without adequate explanation or credible character development.What is missing in the main is a sense of how and why Michael turned around so completely in the last two thirds of the film. From the point at which he becomes a murderer for the first time in a small family restaurant (a scene that stands alone as a masterpiece of direction), the film begins to rattle through events at an ever-increasing pace.\nAt what point does Michael acquire the confidence that allows him to risk exposure in Sicilly simply in order to bully the father of a potential suitor (who soon becomes his wife)?What led him to contact Kay for the first time in years, 12 months after his return to New York? Where is the warmth and passion in their rekindled relationship? We don't see any evidence of it: one moment he is demanding she marry him, the next they have children and he is fully wrapped in the business of running the family's affairs? Why don't we see her response to the inevitable discovery that Michael has since been married (and widowed)? Why does this strong and relatively independent woman so passively accept her role as mobster's put upon, excluded, untrusted spouse, a transformation completed in the closing moments of the film?Is it because her love for Michael is so intense? If so then show us, it is too important a feature of the film for Coppola to ignore.\nAt its best, The Godfather is in a class of its own as an example of cinematic genius. At its worst, it comes across like an upmarket TV mini-series.Perhaps the greatest testament to the director's success in this case is that the film could easily have stretched to four or even five hours and still continued to maintain the viewers' attention. Perhaps then we would have seen many of these loose threads tied up to our satisfaction.3/5", "Best Movie": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.For me this movie best movie i see it .", "It's great": "The Godfather is a beautifully created mafia film. The thing about this movie is that every character has a complicated personality.", "Overrated (*SPOILERS*)": "Wow, what an overrated movie. And since I obviously hold the minority opinion on that, let me elaborate. First, I've seen only the first movie, not II or III. This review is about the first movie, and I was expecting it to stand up as its own movie, which it did not for me.(SPOILERS AHEAD)I'll start with the things I liked. The acting is pretty good, with the exception of a few scenes. Some of the scenery is good, notably the parts that take place in Italy. The portrayal of the different characters and the motivation behind their actions is well done in a fairly complex plot. So, overall, I can see how people would say it's a well-made movie. That's about it.So what did I not like? The Godfather simply did not entertain me.The biggest disappointment was that there really was no major character I could identify with. All the men were basically a bunch of lying, cheating, murderous sons of bees, and I'm not just talking about the family business. They treat their women TERRIBLY. Carlo abuses his wife (there's no excuse to take it to that level, even if it's \"business\"). Sonny, a married man with kids of his own, is seen with mistresses. Even Michael, who might have been the one character I could somewhat identify with, leaves for Italy, stays away more than a year without so much as a peep to his girlfriend Kay, gets married, watches his wife blown to pieces, then shows up in the States again one day and proposes to Kay out of the blue. (\"Did you miss me? Now that my secret wife exploded in flames, I guess that makes you #2 on my list, and oh by the way, I need you, I love you, ooh baby baby, please marry me.\" What total crap.) Then near the end, he refuses to answer her simple question, she (unbelievably) keeps asking, he relents, and with a dramatic pause, he finally lies to her. And she believes him, even just for a few seconds? You've got to be kidding. How can I like a movie when I really don't find myself sympathizing with any of the characters?The violence - not well done. Am I really to believe that a man sleeping on his bed wakes up and discover his horse's severed head placed under the sheet at his feet, with blood covering his own hands and arms? Yeah, that could happen while I sleep... NOT. And what terrible acting when the guy sees the horse head and keeps screaming! Also, the scene where Moe gets shot - look at the bullet hole in his eyeglasses - it's unbelievably small. Was he shot with a needle gun? People might view this as nit-picking, but it really jumped out at me while watching the movie, and it bothered me. And what about Sonny's murder? Is it really necessary to have his killers fire 300 bullets, and to show the whole thing? Look - when the whole premise of a movie is violence, it had better be well-done violence, especially when all the characters are such scoundrels and I don't care who lives and who dies.One of the best movies ever? Hardly. I'd put it in my top 300, because I've probably seen about 300 movies in my life. For some movies, you see them once and if you don't like them or you don't quite understand them, you're at least intrigued enough to want to watch them again. For me, this is not one of those movies.", "wonderful": "The old generation of godfather's calm, calm, deep eyes, with a vague tone about the dignity of men, the words \"I will make him an offer he can't refuse\" let me have a deep respect for this role. Another mission depicts sonny, the elder son of the godfather of the older generation, who is hot-tempered and bent on revenge after his father is shot.", "Nicely done, but lacking substance": "Today, it is by far agreed that The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematography that presents us with a purely masculine, yet passionate reality of the world of gansters. Unfortunately in my case, this very masculine approach to the movie is what makes it a bit dry and well...unpolished...unpolished to the point that I would not call it a masterpiece and I would definitely not have it ranked as #1.On one hand, we are presented with manly values such as loyalty, brotherhood and fatherhood that eventually result in the triumph and conquest of weakness within the man, as well as within the family. On the other hand, these values are only a bitter half of human reality and yet another half, the feminine one, should also be there for it is both these natures that make a true human being, that make a true family. Without this feminine touch, The Godfather, was quite dull and well eventually boring.Though as a man, I did feel the pride and could relate to the masculine aspects of the movie, deep inside, I also missed the emotional side. We see compassion of the Don toward his loyal subjects, but it is not the same kind of compassion one would express toward a human being. We see tears of the defeat, but those tears are quickly slapped out of the face of the one crying. We see romance and love, yet that as well, ends quickly in death and loss of a loved one. This emotional, feminine touch is what makes a great movie great. It allows for a human being to explore his nature in its entirety, not just its part. That's what makes great movies great, such as most of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces for instances. Kurosawa made us feel ourselves through his visions, he made us realize that we're not just men or just women, he made us see our true human nature. His family was one with both polarities present or if they were absent, they would come together at the end. The Godfather instead eliminates this other polarity and creates a distorted vision of a chauvinist world where men govern, men rule and men eat men.In conclusion, the movie is good, but far from the best.", "family": "Laying the foundation for the story, the translation takes a scriptwrit-like approach to presenting the story to the reader. The whole book is as steady and slow as an Italian opera.", "Masterpiece of a film and a score that can't be forgotten": "I am writing this review while listing to The Godfather amazing score and it's just a great thing to listen too whenever and wherever. One of the things that gets me about this movie is the show of emotion in every character the performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is just something I just can't seem to ever forget they just had so much chemistry I honestly couldn't tell you who was better. A performance of a lifetime, or a performance that builds up to a better one that's the way I see it, Al Pacino In \"The Godfather 2\" is a lot better because of that build of from the first movie. But the way he coexisted with Vito/Marlon in the first film was just something to cherish I missed Marlon in the second film just goes to show how good they did with the characters. I love The Godfather and I wish I could've been alive when these films came out I call it the greatest film of all time maybe it's not my favorite but I can't deny the greatness this movie has brought to filmmaking and quite frankly to me.", "pure genius": "`The Godfather' is quite possibly one of the best movies made in history. This film has been quoted/mimicked time and time again, even in a Rugrats (the famous children's cartoon) episode. Why would this movie be quoted so much if it wasn't so amazing?  It wouldn't be. All the hype made about this movie really isn't understood until you actually watch the film.  It's a classic that can't be described.I suppose it's illustriousness could be arguable either way, but most viewers find this movie riveting and engaging.  One could understand how someone could find this movie dry, especially in the beginning.  If you're not familiar with the plot at all, many things could be missed the first time around.  It starts out at his daughters wedding, and from there, all the events can easily run together and cause a vast amount of confusion within the viewer.  If you stick to it, promises are that the movie does get better\u0085immensely. There isn't one single thing that makes this movie so remarkable.  It could be that it had a spectacular cast, intriguing plot, and very realistic situations.  Or, it could be that this movie has what any great story has, a huge change in the main character.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is by far one of the most interesting characters through the movie.  You watch every step of his moves, thoughts, actions and you see him evolve into the person his father tried so hard to keep him away from.   The actual scene where he makes his huge jump could be argued, but it is often believed that this change took place at the hospital.  This was his first opportunity to take charge of the `family business.'Many details, sentences, phrases could go into this review to describe the movie. But, words could never really fill all of the emotions that you experience during this film.  Out of all the classic films I've seen, this is by far the most captivating I've experienced. This film isn't recommended for smaller children, one because they wouldn't be able to comprehend as well as early adults would, and two, because there are some things that may be found offensive to a younger crowd. All in all, this movie receives a 10/10 stars for pure genius.", "Incredible": "It;s either \"Boring and far too long\" or \"The best film ever!\". The crucial factor in these two opinions of 'The Godfather' is...intelligence. The Godfather is an intricate, clever, brilliantly scripted movie.

Its only downfall is that it is possibly too clever for all to enjoy which is a shame.", "One of the Greatest movie of all time": "It's a great movie, realistic and perfect movie of all time.

It\u00b4s the best movie ever made and nobody can make a better one! The actors are completely wonderful and Coppola has created a masterpiece!

Not likely... 10/10!!!!!", "A movie could be called \"bible of male\"": "The film is stunningly good, gripping and entertaining. It shows a superb shooting technique, so that each character is molded into a three-dimensional image. This movie could be called \"man's bible\".

It is a far-reaching romantic epic gangster movie.", "'f**k you' if u don like it": "well i wont be the only one who has given 10 to the godfather. i consider it as the greatest movie in the world. performance by Marlon Brando is far too better than what it was in on the waterfront.also the co-actors had worked really well...of course i need not to tell anything about the class acting of AL pacino. though the Oscar was achieved by sir Marlon Brando but the versatility was more in AL pacino's character.the movie ain't that unfair also...i mean it has given more beauty than what it was in the book. especially the character of Vito and sonny corleone are giving a different identity(good identity) so by which if somebody reads it after the movie then they would keep imaging the moviethe best thing about the movie is they have not left a character unsatisfying. also the story has a normal speed to go and it doesn't bore you in any middle. one must admit that the godfather wouldn't have been what it is without the beautiful direction by Francis f Coppola. also nino Rita has given never forgetting music in the movie which is still today in my ears...in all the godfather is a classic movie which not anyone can ever make again and its all the good magic by the director, Marlon Brando and AL pacino...... 'f**k you if u don like it'.", "Why is \"godfather\" a classic in classics?": "The godfather tells a romantic gangster epic in a melancholy and calm style. It is one of the greatest gangster movies in the history of the film and is known as the bible of men. Not only has the film been successful in criticism, art and box office, but it has also set an example for future generations. It is a classic film praised by many people, and it has a good rating of up to 100 percent on authoritative film websites. The American Film Academy, an authoritative film organization in the United States, appraised it as \"the greatest gangster classic film in the United States\" and \"godfather\" has a profound influence on film history, gangster type films and popular culture. It is the best film in the film history in the hearts of many directors. The excellent interpretation of actors such as Malone Brando, Alpacio, Robert de Niro and so on, coupled with the historical poetical nature of the story itself, makes the film a masterpiece. \"godfather\", as a gangster film, is not nihilism to dilute the meaning of religion, on the contrary, this film has a deep Christian brand, it rarely discusses good and evil, and rarely uses subjective lens to express religious morality, but at several nodes, it focuses on the inner suffering of the characters and lightly expresses this connotation.", "I did not enjoy this movie": "I saw the 50th Anniversary restoration in the cinema, and it was the first time I had seen the film.Firstly, let me say that the acting is impeccable. Marlon Brando is an oddity that will never be replicated. Al Pacino, James Can and Robert Duvall are captivating.But... I didn't enjoy the story. I felt the pacing was too slow and I despised the characters. I do, however, applaud the decision to have Vito forego vengeance to keep the peace. I also felt that the hospital sequence was done to perfection and can see why this film attained the reverence it has since achieved. I noticed issues with cinematography, but don't know whether this was inherent to the original print, or happened during the restoration process, so have tried not to take that into account with my rating.As a 50 year old film, I can accept that times were different. The misogyny in the film felt appropriate to the time the film was set, but the racism was jarring. Especially the comment from one of the Dons about controlling the flow of drugs. It didn't sit well with me at all.I understand that there are plenty of people that do like this film, as the ratings and reviews suggest. This just wasn't to my taste.", "A classic movie.": "Plot and everything is good, but there's one thing I do n' t like. It seems that men need to think a lot, take a lot, but children and women don't. I feel a little sexist.", "a brief evaluation": "Gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, music slow light sadness, interests game human conflict. Whether acting or lens, the use of music, give a person with a kind of beauty to enjoy. Watching this film is extremely need to sink down to savor, but also whenever you turn it over to relive can have a new feeling.", "A new beginning for the American gangster film": "The key to the success of this defining gangster movie is the faultless casting. All the characters are strong and eminently believable. The central masterpiece is, of course, Brando's Don Corleone, a feudal mafia warlord of the old school who can distribute largess or initiate mayhem with no more than a mumbled whisper to his ever-attentive mobster acolytes. Excellent performances from Al Pacino , James Caan, and Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden as the tough, bad cop and one of my favorite screen thugs, Al Lettieri as \"The Turk\" Solozzo. A fairly predictable plot, even if you haven't first read the book , but so what? Its not meant to be a mystery. We the audience KNOW that the enemies of the family are going to get what's coming to them by way of the usual methods, and the director does not disappoint us. The traditional christening juxtaposed with the scenes of vengeful carnage are a masterful touch.Is it possible to be a good son of the Church and a mass murderer all at the same time ? The director poses this question to us and we are discomforted. We have to take on board the new reality that not ALL mobsters are flamboyant psychopaths in the erstwhile Hollywood tradition of James Cagney, Edward G Robinson etc; doomed to perish in a hail of police bullets or in the electric chair. The mafia boss could be the family man next door, the theme picked up and carried to new heights in \"The Sopranos\". At the end of \"The Godfather\", we are left in no doubt that Michael Corleone and his henchmen are highly unlikely to be brought to book for their crimes, and more to the point, we the audience don't mind this one bit.In that respect, that is probably the secret to this films enduring popularity everywhere in the World that it has been screened. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone defends his family and protects their livelihood by doing the hard yards and making the tough decisions. We can all identify with that, but in balance, we are also presented with the down side of Michael's effectiveness as a mob boss. His brother-in-law is dispatched without mercy and he lies without remorse to his wife. These themes were effectively developed in \"The Godfather Pt 2\", which is mostly concerned with the subsequent and inevitable degradation of Michael's humanity, culminating in fratricide. The violence depicted in \"The Godfather\" was extreme at the time of its release and still has the power to shock. This is no bad thing as the mayhem is fully in context with the plot and is in no way glamorized. Real gangsters DO commit horrible crimes and often die in their turn bleeding in a gutter.R.

I think the true greatness of this movie lies in the fact that Puzo and Coppola both worked on the script of these movies. Directors often get a book all wrong and screw up the translation from the book to the movie, and that's only logical, because a book is art and that's personal. THe movie would have been completely different if Coppola had written the screenplay on his own without Puzo telling him what the real essence of the story is.

I liked this movie, adored it. And with all the respect that I have for this heavyweight striking flick, my sub- conscience tells me that there seems to be an overrating that simply has been unable to be tamed down for years. First of all, this is a great gangster movie with the most common characteristics of a mafia circuit. Superb acting is harshly evident with a small dose of surrealism. This is everything a true-life movie needs to have. But, still, I think that this is somehow one-dimensional and self-appreciative. It doesn't have a universal sense of mafia mob but remains within the confines of a single direction of storytelling. It concentrates on the Italian mob, a single family and no further. It depicts, marvelously, the structure of that-time mafia entourage and the set of rules it was based upon. However, I think there have been several other movies which, if not as subtly as The Godfather, precisely have managed go beyond the classic understanding of mafia and grasped a wider span of this topic. Anyway, The Godfather, though overrated, still remains self-contained and deserves to be one of the best but with all this time having passed by, not the best one. 10/10", "Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli": "Without a doubt, it is the most cinematic triumph of its' kind...the narrative goes beyond the lens, it delivers an all star performance from the gritty dark family crimes of the early 40's .......\nThe performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro and others were superb.\nLet's not forget some of the best lines from any film that every Italian / Italo-American and Gangster lovers still to this day pronounce them with the garb and audacity to catch a laugh.... LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE CANNOLI...\nThe Godfather, the ultimate Mafia Movie....", "Who's the real godfather in this film?": "Well what is there to say about this movie?  Is it still the top movie on this site, or is it not?  Personally, it is not one of the reviewer's all time favorites, but it is still a very good movie.  One significant  detail of this movie, is counter culture.  The movie is filled with it.As the movie starts Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is known as the Godfather, is in his office. It is his daughters wedding day, and according to  Sicilian tradition, he cannot refuse any requests that are made to him that day. The room is filled with people wanting something. The whole family is there for the occasion.  Michael (Al Pacino), the God father's youngest son , is back home from the war. He brings his new girl friend,   (Diane Keaton)  with him. Michael's brothers,  Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there too.Family loyalty is an important message that is stressed in this movie. The Don, Vito Corleone heads the family . He is against dealing in drugs. According to him,  society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling or prostitution, but he feels it is wrong to deal drugs. He refers to it as a dirty business. What appears to be a moral decision on the Don's part is really counter culture because his decision not to support dealing in drugs has nothing to do with the legality of it but because he feels society would not accept it.   A lot of emphasis is put on trusting a man's word, yet the central character do not always trust each other.  Woman are not highly regarded by the family. The Don's wife is only shown in a few scenes. Sonny ignores his wife. and the Don's daughter Connie's husband is not allowed into the family business. Instead, he given a job so he can earn a living.  The counter culture in this movie, represents the killings of innocent, and not so innocent people between families.  Throughout most of the movie, the Corleone family is in somewhat of a battle between another Italian family. Because of this, Don Corleone who is the Godfather of many, (Marlon Brando) is shot by one of the other families.  This heats up the subject for the Corleone family, because it puts two of his sons Michael (Al Pacino) and Santino `Sonny' (James Caan) in between a rock and a hard place.  That is just one of the examples of counter culture in this movie.  Here is another example.  Sunny finds out two different times that his sister's husband is beating her.  Outraged by all this happening, Sunny takes off to go find his brother in law.  The first time, he finds him, he is successful in beating the wind out of him, however the second time he gets gunned down by his in-laws.   Right about then, Don, is called to make a peace treaty with the other family, to stop all this violence between the families.  But are all the violent scenes in the movie over with? Unfortunately not. There are so many more examples of counter culture than the ones listed in this review. In order to see all the examples of counter culture, you would have to view the movie a couple times to understand what is going on in it.Over all, it was a very good movie in my opinion.  I was Glued to the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting to see what happens next.  The reviewer gives The Godfather a five gold star rating.", "they don't make them like this anymore": "Everything you want a film to be, this is it. Amazing character(s) development and story that keeps you interested. All the actors seemed to be born to play these characters, especially Brando and Pacino who are at their finest.", "Controversial af": "Might just be me but it's overated. At the time i'm sure my grandad loved it but it just didn't do it for me. Go watch Goodfellas", "ASTOUNDING": "This right here is cinema at its finest, this film has immediately broken into my top 5, and it is pretty tight up there so high praise to Don Carleone.\nSuch a well written, well directed and well performed masterpiece that has definitely stood the test of time", "All-time classic": "People often compare \"The Godfather\", which in many ways is thought of as the original crime drama, with many others that have come since(namely Goodfellas). However, I have yet to see one of these films surpass the original Godfather; it really is as great as everyone says it is.Based on influence, iconic moments and authenticity alone, \"The Godfather\" has entrenched itself deeply in film history. The acting, character writing, cinematography and screenplay are all outstanding and make the three-hour long runtime more than worth the experience. In particular, I was most impressed with the ensemble staging when a crowd was present which, combined with the editing, kept the film more than engaging enough even when not much was happening. There are more great iconic moments in this film than I care to name; \"The Godfather\" has been referenced and mimicked countless times. Yet even without the glow of its influence, these moments would stand well on their own.This film can be very daunting for a first-time viewer. It is nearly three hours long and a universally acclaimed classic that one feels the pressure to appreciate. However, I promise you that this one has earned every bit of praise that it gets.", "A true triumph in cinema": "This movie balances humanity, drama, and classic mafia violence in spades. The death of Sonny stands out as one of the most iconic moments from the movie with graphic violence and zero restraint. The Godfather also deals with the struggle of a man who tries to do good but has to deal with the pressure of his family. This movie balances the style of a gangster movie with the substance of a carefully crafted story.", "Very good film": "It's perfect for my current mood. Reccoment it everyone", "The Best adaptation of novel to Movie": "Well the Godfather is really one of the best adaptation of novel to book. I know that there are probably few of the newer viewers of this movie who read the book, but if you first read the book when the book first came out in the 70's and waiting patiently for the movie to be released you weren't  disappointed in the movie. I think it is the best gangster movie and if you are fortunate to own the DVD you are in for a treat. There are lots of goodies here.\nThis is a movie that is just a good story and it makes you feel fo this family.", "Oh Those Corleones": "No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two \"Godfather\" films, \"The Conversation,\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\" \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\", the third \"Godfather\") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before \"Jack\" there was \"The Godfather.\" While I feel the whole \"Godfather\" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. \"The Godfather\" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, \"The Godfather\" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-", "briliant": "Gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, music soothing light sadness, interest game human nature conflict. Whether it is acting or the use of the lens, music, give a person with a kind of beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely need to sink down to savor, and whenever it comes out to review can have a new feeling", "The best movie when i ever watched": "The head of the Mafia clan, Vito Corleone, marries off his daughter Connie. Just in time for the wedding, Don Vito's youngest son Michael returns from the war. He has fought heroically and returned home with the firm conviction not to continue his father's business, but to do honest business. Don Corleone and his clan grow richer and more influential every year, which naturally displeases other members of the New York underworld. By cunning manipulations and intrigues, Carleone's enemies first kill one of Vito's men, and then make an attempt on the Don himself. Michael vows to save his father and declares war on the criminal gangs.Italian by birth, but American by birth, Francis Ford Copolla had already won an Oscar before The Godfather, but as a screenwriter. The first part of the gangster saga brought him real fame, as it won three Oscars upon its release, and was acknowledged as an important film work in the US and throughout the world.In 1969, a book by Mario Puzo, The Godfather, was published, making a lot of noise and becoming a national bestseller. The book tells the story of the harsh laws in the world of Italian mafiosi, of which many Americans did not even know. Two years later, because of his poverty, Puso sold the screen rights to the 33-year-old Copolla. The young director dared to make such a difficult film by inviting Hollywood icon Marlon Brando to the lead role. The second main role, he asked actors such as Robert De Niro, Martin Sheen and Robert Redford, but Copolla refused all, inviting this role to an unknown actor Al Pacino, whom he noticed in the film \"Panic in Needle Park. The role immediately earned Pacino an Oscar nomination, which, however, he ignored.The phenomenon of the popularity of such a violent film lies in the fact that Copolla, using tough artistic techniques, showed the true value of family. The director succeeded in revealing the drama of the picture, which lies in the tragedy of a war hero and a very honest young man, Michael, who had to transcend his own beliefs under the pressure of responsibility and family interests. His transformation from a simple boy to a violent mobster is one of the most skilful metamorphoses in world cinema.", "A man like God.": "\"Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.\"", "An amazing movie with a confusing plot": "Some people say this movie is way to heavy handed, especially compared to today's movies and movies Gen Z people like.As a Gen Z, I disagree.

This movie definitely deserved the love it got.", "Can I have those 3 hours of my life back, please?": "Maybe it is simply because I am not from the generation of when this movie came out back in '72, but my god this was a bore.The acting, the script, and even the set of the movie I found to be quite great, as a matter of fact.Aside from that, all I got from this movie was a group of men ramble on and on and on about whatever. This movie did not keep me interested at all. The wedding scene was way too long, there is not much of a build up to anything for the most part. It is as if I am watching family members have conversation, and that's it. The ending scenes I found to be exciting, but at that point I was already tuned out of the movie, and found myself playing temple run just to pass the time. I literally would glance back and forth at the clock just to see how much time this movie took up from my life.So yeah, this movie was a giant bore-fest for me, giving me little to no motivation to watch Part II and Part III.", "Godfather of world": "It is an absolutely a action packed blockbuster movie. What a movie by ford, evergreen blockbuster movie.", "Classic!": "I just watched The Godfather and I'm absolutely blown away. It's a classic that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life. The story follows the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia family, and the struggles of its patriarch, Don Vito Corleone.Marlon Brando gives an incredible performance as Don Vito Corleone. His portrayal is powerful, charismatic, and captivating. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Diane Keaton all deliver outstanding performances. The direction is masterful, with Francis Ford Coppola bringing the story to life.The Godfather is an iconic movie that is a must-watch for any movie fan. The story is captivating, the characters are compelling, and the performances are all excellent. It's a timeless classic that will remain a favorite of movie fans for years to come. Highly recommended.", "History's most overrated film": "This film is a mafia version, but without the existential philosophical depth of The Brothers karamazov.They took the structure of Dostoevsky's book, but without having the same depth, and set it in the mafia.", "A movie you can't aspire to": "An important place in the history of the economy is occupied by the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United Weather in search of a new, more efficient life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinian dons. Who knew in those days that this \"bunch of Sicilian emigrants\" would take a big place in the United States and in the history of this country.Sicily is one of the most beautiful places in Italy. Unfortunately, the Sicilians, the rather friendly inhabitants of the islands of this, are synonymous with Sicily not only olives, oil and wine, but also words such as omerta, vendetta and mafia. Yes, mafia. A small bunch of pasta bandits in Sicily, run by a don. In the US, the word has a slightly different meaning. A huge number of gangsters seeking to conquer and rule all States. A family is a mafia, a mafia is a family in which a cruel and wise man belongs, who belongs to everyone and belongs. Proudly and briefly - don.", "Credit to Gordon Willis": "After seeing the first two Godfather movies again, I'm reminded how much their success is to the eternal credit of cinematographer Gordon Willis (and the production designer & actors), and how much the great fraud of Francis Coppola being a talent is held up entirely by his collaboration with people like Willis, Vittorio Storaro and Haskel Wexler in the 70's and early 80's.

It is another one of my main favorite movies. Marlon Brando is the light of the screen, in my opinion, in which was his best performance ever. Highly recommended. Skip part two and three, see Part One!A GIGANTIC 10 out of 10.", "A superb, yet confusing movie": "\"The Godfather\" is an extremely well known movie and one thatthis reviewer just recently saw for the first time.  There is a lot oftalk about it being the best movie ever made but honestly, thereare other movies that could be better.  The cast was made up ofsome pretty famous actors and they all did marvelous acting jobs. The movie definitely wasn't lacking in that area.  It was a bigattention getter in the way that there could be a scene where theactors would be talking and talking, which isn't too exciting, andthen soon after it would be like \"BAM!\" and there was action.  Itwould certainly wake up anyone in the audience who might havebeen dozing off.  All in all, the movie didn't have too much talk, ortoo much action, it was just the right amount of both. It did have a superflous amount of special effects though, mostbeing gun shots and explosions.  Considering the fact that themovie is about the life of a crime family, the enormous amount ofkilling that there is throughout the film isn't too suprising.  Maybe alittle disturbing, but not suprisng.  This reviewer has never seen amovie with as much killing as \"The Godfather.\"  It was likesomeone was killed from this family, so they killed the person whodid the killing.  Then that family killed the person who killed theirfamily member and it went on like that back and forth and back andforth, if that even makes sense.  It was like an argument.  Person # 1 says something to person # 2, so person #2 says somethingback to person #1 and so on and so on.  There was just anexcessive amount of killing.  In fact, all the killing is sort of the thingthat the viewer might remember the most about \"The Godfather.\" This movie does something that a lot of movies dare not do.  It letssome main characters die.  That is probably the most unpredictable aspect of the entire movie.  When people watchmovies they don't expect any main characters to die and they rarelyever do.  The fact  that \"The Godfather\" does this, although it issad, is stupendous. The plot of  the movie revolves around the crime family, Corleone. It basically follows their lives during a certain period of time.  Whatthat period of time is, this reviewer does not exactly know.  In mostmovies, when there has been a big time difference they say at thebottom of the screen, \"one year later\" or something like that.  \"TheGodfather\" does not do that.  Instead of putting the time changeinto words at the bottom of the screen it's put into words that theactors say.  It makes it so the audience has to listen very closely tothe movie to hear how long its been since something happened. This reveiwer thinks that this is done because when words are putat the bottom of the screen, like subtitles, it distracts the viewer'sattention away from the movie and what is going on.  In \"TheGodfather\" there is not this problem. The clothing worn in the movie wasn't anything like big, fancycostumes, but there was something about them that was quiteinteresting.  If the viewer was really paying attention to the actors'outfits they would notice that the men are always wearing sometype of suit.  They're never caught walking around in casual wear,just suits.  And the women are always wearing dresses.  Theydon't wear pants with t-shirts, they wear dresses.  Tha'ts prettygrand if you ask me. \"The Godfather\" was a very superb movie, but there are others thatare better.  It's worst feature is the enormous amount of killing.  Itis entertaining to watch, but it's not one that this reviewer wouldwant to watch over and over again.", "wonderful, and cool": "The Godfather was a wonderfully done movie. This movie had comedy, romance, death, family. The movie begins with the lead Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his daughters wedding. This means in ritual that anyone may come to the Godfather asking for a favor. Whether someone needs to be killed, or something needs to happen in order for that person to succeed. This movie revolves around Mafia people, such as the other leaders in the mafia besides Don Vito. Now after his daughters wedding day he is already processing these favors that people have asked of him. As the movie progresses Don Vito gets shot, but to the peoples dismay he survives. Though he is no longer a threat to the other Mafia Leaders. Then after a few other mishaps Don Vito's son Michael turns the tables as he begins the process of becoming the Godfather. Once this happens, Michael handles what he needs too and then the film ends. I know that the reason this movie ended this way was because there was eventually going to be a sequel. I personally enjoyed this movie, it sucks you in like a twister. It just has this part that keeps your curiosity button going. I know this, as I started this movie not wanting to watch and after the first hour I was hooked. Now I will most likely go out and rent the others to see if this extremely sensational classic can be out done. I know that if this movie did not have as much romance, death, or family values then it would of not been appealing to me. I recommend this movie, it in a way shows that the little man can become more then you ever thought.", "undoubtedly the best mob movie ever!": "The Godfather is the classic mob movie. The film is totally different from all the others in its genre. The way Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote this film so that the viewer actually sympathizes with the characters of the Italian mafia. Within the first scene the writers introduced all the main characters and all that's left to the film are twists, suspense, surprises and thrills.The film also has many romantic scenes. Michael Corleone (Pacino) is in Sicily and walking through the open country when he and his two bodyguards stumble upon a beautiful young woman leading a school of children. Their eyes meet and it's love at first sight.  Michael being brought up with the utmost respect went to the girls father and asked to meet her in the presence of their family. The viewer can't help but think `How sweet.' Fortunately the father approves and love blossoms into marriage.The acting in the film is like no other and with so many big stars the viewer can't help but be excited to see so many great names in one film. Marlon Brando plays the role of the Godfather AKA Don Corleone, the leader of one out of five Italian mafias in the New York area. The way Brando developed his character was amazing and his famous voice in the film that has been mimicked for 30 years now sounds untouchable in it's originality. Al Pacino plays Brando's son Michael Corleone, who actually wasn't wanted for the part at the time but the studio cast him with the recommendation from the Director (Francis Coppola). Pacino actually sets the bar for himself when he took this role, and for all the future roles he would play in Mafia movies. His acting is compelling, and his looks are almost unrecognizable.There are actually no innocent by-standers that get hurt or victimized in the film that you might see in other mafia movies. Infact everyone that ends up dead were people that were a part of one of the mafia families. The whole film is about respect and the closeness of family if you can see behind all the violence.The film is quite long to sit through in one sitting but is totally worth it by the end. The film will grab you in an instant with curiosity to the underground world of the mob.This is undoubtedly the best mob movie ever. This film is recommended for people that love mafia films. And for the people who don't really care for these types of movies this film will change your mind on organized crime movies.", "a great movie": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.", "work a genous": "The God Father Part One is named by this web site to be the greatest movie of all time and for good reason. This movie is a tale of mobsters but as the movie goes on the viewer begins to relate to the mobsters. This movie is a feet of writing, directing, and filming. Music set to this movie fits perfectly to each scene and sets the mood for that scene. This movie has nothing to do with most people's real life instead it has to do with their dreams of wealth and power and is a great movie for any one who has ever dreamed of wealth. \tThe main character in this movie evolves from one who is dead set against becoming a member of the family to the head of the family this transition is the focus of the story and is told and shown very well.", "Marlon the Great": "I don't know why,but since i know about myself i loved mob movies.There is something interesting in the way of a mafioso to the top,and his fall.So it is not a miracle,that The Godfather trilogy is my favourite movie. The Godfather trilogy is a magnificent saga about the Corleone family and it's way to the top of the American mob.Afcourse and their way into the high society of admired people.But,behind this story lies one more story,as complex as the first,about higher values,family,love and respect.It is very interesting to see Vito Andolini's(Marlon Brando) way from his departure from Sicily,where he was on the run because local boss Don Cicci wanted to kill him because he thought that Vito is going to take revenge on him for killing his father and brother,to New York's ''Litlle Itally'' where he is living like a bum.Although Vito had a really small wage,he bought a pear every day and brought it to his wife to show his love,respect and gratitude.Later,Vito became a very wise man and the king of the Mafia. God never gives without taking.Don Vito in one of his wars with the other families lost his oldest son,Sonny(James Caan).So, today we all know a old Mafia saying:For revenge always kill the brother. It means that you never kill the man that brought you harm,but you should kill someone that is closest to his heart.It will hurt more.On this way Vito's youngest son (Al Pacino) and his ''grandson'' (Andy Garcia) will lose their wives.And there is one more thing that the movie shows the best.What money can do to a man!When their parents die Michael kills Fredo because he let him down.Horrible,but logic.The movie is filled with great actors.James Caan is a real hot-head,old school wise guy.Al Pacino is also great as a man that doesn't want to meddle into family business but then becomes a killer.MARLON BRANDO is.... i really can't find the word to describe it.He made the most known role in the world as the rightful Don.Marlon magnificently paint a portrait of a man who doesn't forget the friendship shown to him and is willing to help anybody that respects him.If somebody shows hate to the Don,he makes him an offer he can't refuse and deals with him quickly.The words that illustrate how much is Brando a good actor,are the words that Nicholson spoke on Brando's funeral:''Now,when Marlon is gone,all we actors will rise a few steps above''.A unmissable classic", "The best film made !": "The godfather Must be the best film ever made? The story is so good and the filming by Coppola outstanding There are also so many smal details in this trilogy that are used in other films as a refferens. and the preformans of Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen)is exelent..You can se the same exelent filming in \"Apocalypse now\" in these two films you can see some of the genius that makes Coppola films so great!The Godfather nr:1  Apocalypse now nr:2", "The Godfather part 1": "This movie is widely considered in the community of film critics to be a landmark in motion picture history and is rightfully so ranked up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca as one the best movies in history. The lines are iconic, the scenes of family, betrayal and violence are all memorable, the performances are beyond Oscar worthy and it does what any great adaptation does; stay as faithful to the original as possible and only make changes whenever necessary. For me the most iconic scene is the baptism murders, which I felt are appropriately edited as Michael Corleone oversees the baptism of his infant son. The only minor nitpick I have is that, although Marlon Brando does give a solid performance, the look they gave him is a little too much like a geezer for me to believe he is a Mafia don. Nonetheless, this is a film that anyone taking a cinema class should watch.", "You Can't Call Yourself A Film Lover if you Haven't Seen This": "Is The Godfather my favorite film ever made? No, but it definitely is one of the best movies out there. Not only does it follow an incredibly complex story, but it is filmed beautifly, and the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is brilliant. If you call yourself a film buff and haven't seen The Godfather, you definitely have some work to do.\n I saw The Godfather for the first time when I was probably around 14 or 15, and had some trouble fully grasping why people love it so much. But again, I was young and probably just thought to myself, oh, the movie's old so it's boring. Boring however is definitely not a word to describe this film. It is the complete opposite of boring, with more suspense than just about any other movie ever made. Coppola did not want a movie which was from start to finish mafia gangsters shooting at each other, but instead a movie that makes you bite your nails either hoping for a character to survive or the opposite... The characters (originally from Mario Puzo's book) are either characters you root for, or they are terrible people who don't deserve to live. One of the humanizing elements that is critical to numerous characters in the film is their love for their families. Marlon Brando's character of Vito Corleone is a terrible man, who has had dozens if not hundreds of people killed before, but he has a deep love and care for his family.\n To sum up what I think about this film without spoiling anything, even if you're not into the mafia genre, if you are a person who claims to like film, this movie is absolutely a must see.", "Don is a great man": "Vito Corleone is Don of the NY crime family. He acquires fame and fortune by himself after immigrating to US from Italy. He has three sons and the youngest son, Michel lives honestly with no connection with gangster's business. One day, Don gets hurt by the other crime family that against him. And Michel decides to retaliation. This story is far from my real life but I was very interested in it. I felt parental love from that Don want Michel to live not like him. Don is a great person and that is reason why he becomes Don. I think Michel does not have to fight against the men. But if I were him, I am sure to do same. This film is apparently full of violence but indeed full of humanity, emotion and love. I recommend you to watch it if you want to think about your human nature. You must be able to learn a lot from Don Corleone.", "Well worth the time": "I find it extremely disheartening that people would complain about the length of \"The Godfather.\"  Unlike most movies of the three hour duration, I find that when I view \"Godfather,\" not once do I look at my watch or think about how long it is.  And that is simply because it is the closest thing to perfection on  film that we have yet to see.  Never once do I question it when I see this ranked as the #1 film on various lists.  Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors.  And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando.  So for those of you who don't like three hour movies, you'd better stick to the 90 minute masterpieces like \"Cruel Intentions\" and \"Gone in 60 Seconds.\" You'll probably understand them better.", "One of the Greatest Films Ever": "\"The Godfather\" is a masterful film, rich in every component essential to it's development. Along with the terrific story-line and plot, the characters and the actors who play them really make this movie. One cannot help becoming deeply enveloped in the film with all its terrific elements fitting together like a jigsaw puzzle. It is truly a film masterpiece.", "Smells like Sicily": "This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it's the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it's not a movie made by a \"true\" Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of \"my\" arid land. It's not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone's speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA", "\"I Believe In America.\"": "\"America has made my fortune.\" This is the opening quote to The Godfather and in my opinion, the best movie in American history. And what would America be without it's greatest cinema-piece? It would be a nation lost of entertainment, a nation without a character as undeniable as Marlon Brando's Godfather. Without him, there would be a missing link to every actor in the history of cinema minus the few previous such as Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca. The performance of he convinces anyone that Don Vito Corleone is truly alive. Not only alive in the film,  but alive as an actual person who speaks to us in volumes, a man who's moral guidelines and love for his family make him a respectable role model, even though he is the head of a mafia family. Don Corleone reaches out to all that see this movie and he is instantly respected as a person of honor, one who we know is of high power, yet is more a democrat rather than a fascist like other corrupt crime lords. Sonny, his son is in fact, fascist in a manner of speech and it shows when he must take over the business. Tragically, Michael the youngest son of the Corleone family is molded into the form of \"zero tolerance\" throughout the picture. The film really isn't about the Mafia; it's about family. The most important thing in The Godfather isn't the rise of power or the loss of it, only how much the other people in your life mean to you.\nMany movies inevitably become boring and have scenes that are meant to be remembered but are easily forgettable. The Godfather never becomes boring. It hooks you the minute it begins and keeps you attached. Impressive for nearly a three-hour movie. An undertaker gives a speech to convince Don Corleone to avenge his daughter against the decadent hoods that attempted to rape her. From there on, the movie continues as a sweeping epic. Death strikes many times in this movie; all the moments of this are breathtaking and at many times, heart-wrenching. I sympathize for the many characters in The Godfather that meet with tragedy because they are so lovable. The 1972 classic takes you inside of the crime syndicate; a place I am oddly enough, happy to be. I feel like a member of the Corleone family every time I watch. Prior to viewing, I must admit that this world wasn't my most desired destination. Many parts and lines are memorable in this movie. What's so amazing is that most of them are back to back, which is a trademark of director Francis Ford Coppola. Most of his films achieve continuous scenes, ones that are embedded in our minds forever. For further proof, see Apocalypse Now or The Godfather Part II.The Godfather is however, better than it's sequel. Even though the second film may have a more powerful and haunting conclusion and may also have more of a meaning, it still doesn't dig as deep into your soul like the original. Why is the first movie better you ask? Because The Godfather is in this one. Not Robert De Niro's version, but Marlon Brando's. To attempt to replace Brando is a ridiculous waste of time. Brando is The Godfather. No one else can compete with that.", "spoiler": "i think this might sound wrong but i think this movie was alright. but as well as the first one I've got to give its props but in my opinion it doesn't compare to the second one. but i did not love it also think thank al pacino was the best actor in this movie. and i also believe the second one is far better than the first don't you think i meen come on please much more theatrical more excitement of course even better acting but as well as the the boat seen if you don't think this movie as as good the first one i think that there might be something you missed in the second like the boat seen or lots of stuff but you've got to remember it is just a movie ;>", "As good as it gets...": "The Godfather has been a tradition in my family forever.  Even when I was young I wanted to see what this \"wonderful\" movie was like.  Finally, when I was eight, my whole family got together on New Year's Eve to watch the trilogy and The Godfather became my all time favorite movie.  There is nothing better.  I've seen the movie a million times, and never get tired of it.  I also enjoy watching the little documentary before the movie, but that totally spoils some of it if you haven't seen it before.  My family says I like Part 1 more than Part 2 because Marlon Brando was in it (yes, partly, but he's my favorite actor), but the story was so much better.  Many movies that are based on the book tend to add ridiculous scenes, but the Godfather kept true to the story.  All of the actors were wonderful, and now, the Corleone family is like a part of my family.", "NEEDS TO BE #1 IN IMDBs GREATEST MOVIES LIST": "100/100\nYou have to see this masterpiece. Trust me. I saw The Shawshank Redemption and it's good, but I refuse to believe that that its in any way shape or form any better than this glorious film. A true MUST-SEE in any list of good movies. I truly hope that if any millennials should be offended by this movie they should and need to die...\nSlowly.", "The Greatest Mafia Movie Ever Made!": "How can you doubt it? From the very moment the picture started, I had goosebumps. Marlon Brando gives an excellent Oscar winning performance, that I can't imagine anyone else playing Don Vito Corleone. Not to mention its Oscar nominated actors in supporting roles, Al Pacino, James Caan (who should have won), and Robert Duvall. The directing is absolutely spellbinding, the cinematography is terrific, costume design is great. To me, there is no better mob movie that explains the troubles of a Italian family in crime. I have many many favorite scenes, especially everyone else's favorite scene when John Marley finds his prized horse's head in his bed. There's that, and when Michael sends his guys to whack Moe Green and others during his baptism. The saddest scene in the film was when Sonny gets murdered, I know he was an ass-hole but he was cool too, it upset me so much I almost couldn't watch it anymore. I think the only scene that grabbed me was the very beginning of the film, when a man asks for \"justice\" over his daughter. I don't know why it always got my close attention, maybe it was because it was the very first scene in the movie, but ever since I was hooked on seeing that first scene whenever I would watch it. People often say that the best thing they get out of this film is Al Pacino as Michael, but I sort of disagree. Al Pacino launched his career in this movie, but the key element in this movie is Marlon Brando. This is the best and my favorite performance he has ever given in a movie, mainly because it was the first movie I have ever seen of him. I can honestly tell ya, that there is nothing like The Godfather. Ever! 11/10!", "Very classic gangster movies.": "The gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, the music soothes the faint sadness, the interest game human nature conflict. Whether it is acting or lens, the use of music, give people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this film is extremely need to sink down to savor carefully, and no matter when it comes out to relive can have new thinking.", "The Greatest Film of all time Hands Down": "This movie is a timeless classic. I have never seen a movie that matches its excellence nor do I think I ever will. Brando rightfully deserved the Oscar he received for the movie (although his performance in On the Waterfront was better). The AFI list says Citizen Kane is the best movie of all time, but Citizen Kane doesn't come close to reaching the brilliance of the Godfather. Coppola got everything right and made the right choice of choosing the no-name actor Pacino (at the time) for the role as Michael. There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film. The character development is also outstanding. I would extremely recommend this movie to anyone interested in knowing about the great movies of all time. Superb 10/10.", "Watched in 4k": "Still the best and even better with recent 4k transfer. When they released the blurays they did the originals a disserve. It was nice to see them take the time and attention to details and truly restored this classics to its original state. Better dare we say?", "The Godfather I": "True, the film was about the Mafia, and in the minds of the Mafias are usually depicted as violent, ruthless, anti-people and cruel, but in this film it can even be said that the Corleone Mafia, and Vito Corleone, the Good Mafia is shown! A godfather who cares about those around him, sometimes does justice to them, his family does not care about him, and he does not use his influence to trade drugs and pays for it! Of course, apart from the differences between Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone, the film finally comes to the point that when the mafia, and business and work take precedence over the family, you will kill people in the general way and have to commit crimes. Who knows, maybe the world of politics is the same, with the difference that there is no escape from it ...", "A MASTERPIECE": "NO NEED TO SAY ANYTHING TO PROMOTE THIS MOVIE. A CLASSIC.", "It was unique and extremely beautiful": "It was unique and extremely beautiful in the film of family relations, we can feel the sense of revenge and... well The grandeur of the godfather was so great that I fell in love with this character The Godfather is one of the best movies in history. I fell in love with this movie because some of its sequences were really so wonderful that I was willing to watch this movie several more times. I enjoyed.I give it a 9 because it was awesome\nIt was beautiful, very beautiful.The actors were also wonderful. The gun bullets in the sequences where they shoot someone, the person starts bleeding very naturally, and I wonder if they play natural in the 1970s or at least the last decade.", "A masterpiece well-deserving of its #1 status": "There are few films that can make the claim of being regarded as the best film ever made. \"Citizen Kane\" could. \"Casablanca\" could. But here on IMDb, \"The Godfather\" reigns supreme, and with good reason.Do not make the mistake of thinking that The Godfather is a mobster movie, focusing on action, violence, and Tommy guns. Think of the title, and what it implies. The movie could have been titled \"The Mafia\", \"The Don\", or a dozen other things, but instead, they chose a familial word for this film. Thus, it must be the family, and specifically, the role of Godfather, that must be the film's subject.There are three Godfathers that this movie examines: Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), Sonny Corleone (James Caan), and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). All three have their defining traits; Vito his traditional views, Sonny his furious temper, and Michael his reluctance to enter into the family business. Through the leadership of each, the movie follows the story of the Corleone family as they cope with joy and sadness, and life and death.One of the most enduring aspects of The Godfather is its score. Probably behind only the works of John Williams (Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones) in its recognizability, the familiar theme form The Godfather has become the theme for the mafia and every stereotyped Italian mobster group the world over. Likewise, infamous scenes such as that involving the surprise left for the stubborn director have ingrained themselves into the realm of organized crime forever.The story that The Godfather tells is superb. As power transfers from one leader to the next, we hope for the best for people that are ultimately criminals. How was director Francis Ford Coppola able to humanize figures that would typically be stereotyped? By infusing them with life and background, and showing to the audience that even the hardest mafia hitman has a softer side.The Godfather has accomplished a feat few films have: winning enough critical and audience acclaim to cement itself in cinema history forever. As long as people desire to experience human drama on an intimate level, The Godfather will \"make them an offer they can't refuse\".", "A bond between a father and his son is immense": "A man must be with his family. If he is not in contact with his family he is not a man. Problem is the family is part of an organized crime syndicate. Throughout this film by Francis Coppola we get the opportunity to get a slice of pie in this family and time period of Americana.\nIn this grand flow of a film there are two main characters `The Godfather' Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Interesting is the evolution of each of the main characters both on opposite points of power (one neutral and one powerful) to switching sides in the end. There is even a key part of the film were Michael joins into the family business and that is during his trip to the hospital.Through the film I was amazed at all the realism spread about on the mafia and the family. Not to mention the fact that the dealings of the mafia were never shown or totally discussed; this was more about the family and what it took to survive in corrupt New York, New York.This film is one of my favorites now because of it as a whole. The build of the plot, the music at certain scenes that created a tension from the character, and the mesmerizing visuals placed nicely. I would recommend this film to anyone and the dog skip.", "A dynamic film that has no substitute": "This film is truly one of a kind\"The Godfather\" tells the story of the Corleone family, an Italian family involved in organized and legitimate crime.  The patriarch (Marlon Brando) is beginning to lose rule over the family and his business, and new management must betaken over by either of his two sons, Sonny (James Caan) or Michael (AlPacino), along with tension between other crime families in 1950's New York.This is a very original and genuine story that truly has no substitute.  It is brought to life by a wonderful cast and it's powerful nature will grab the attention of even the most picky audience member.One scene this reviewer would like to point out is the scene in the italianrestaurant.  Pacino's character, Michael, is pulling out a gun from a bathroom stall.  As he does so, a train can be heard approaching.  As the bulk of the train screeches by, Pacino stands there, contemplaiting his next move.  As the train begins to fade from hearing, Pacino goes back into the restaurant and murders the two clients at his meeting.  This scene shows the change of Michael from the war hero, to the family's next hit man, as he steps onto the first rung of the ladder of eventual family succession.  The train, in the eyes (or ears if you prefer) of this reviewer, is symbolic of his transition.  Before the train: war hero; after the train: Hit man.This film is one of a kind.  It has it all: love, anger, drama, vengeance, honor, and a plethera of other emotions that one would think would be too much for onefilm.  It has certainly earned best movie in the eyes of the reviewer, and a piece of American art, culture and history.", "the transitions": "The Director of the drama hit `The Godfather' Francis Ford Coppola, was unique at directing this film. There seem to be a lot of transitions in this film and mystery. He also was sneaky at who is the real main character.\tThe movie is full of suspense and disbelief, The casting director was remarkable at finding the right people to play the part. When watching this movie ask you self one question, do you feel sorry for this family, that's full of hatefulness and war? I asked my self that question and yeah, I did because of the way Coppola took the movie apart and pieced it back together in a different way. The transitions are some-what noticeable and there are others when you might have to watch it again to see it. \tThe one thing that could have been changed was when ever the Italian family or even when ever they were speaking in Italian it was hard to understand what was going on, but it also could have been used as a tactic to throw the viewer off. Another thing that could have been changed was the timing was difficult to comprehend, between 2 days or a year.", "The Goodfather": "The Godfather is arguably the greatest American movie ever made. A film with all the classic movie elements that's perfectly created and executed. Highly regarded by critics and thoroughly studied by film students and movie lovers alike, The Godfather is a masterpiece. It's such a classic that it is still a strong contender in the `Best Movie Ever' debate. \t \tNo other movie has told such an involved story of the mafia. Only could a director like Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo, create such an atmosphere of believability. By the end of this epic film, the audience has a newfound respect for some notorious mobsters and unexpected sympathy becomes apparent. Never has such a movie before or since told the story of important values among common criminals so well as here. \t \tOnly with fantastic actors could you pull off such a reversal of feelings toward the mafia. Marlon Brando does a fantastic job as the lovable patriarch, whose swollen growl makes him feel like the `Mafia Santa Clause'. The always-good Al Pacino creates a deep character full of turmoil and ultimate greed. His role of Michael, `the heir to the thrown', goes through an extreme transformation of personality and values. Such superb actors like these, and others such as Robert Duvall and James Caan, create an environment full of complex and intriguing characters. \t \tThe technical execution of this film is stunning. From the first frame to the end credits, this movie is film production at its finest. Unique and smooth camera movements pair nicely with the story; the score is the quintessential piece to such a gripping plot; and I have never seen a more entertaining murder than in this movie. \t \tA flawless piece of cinema throughout. Great writing, directing and acting make it a classic for the ages. Never have I felt more connected to such ruthless and villainous individuals than in this film. The `climax' of The Godfather sums up all the feelings in the movie: countless murders over the sounds of a child's Catholic Baptism. Outstanding. \nOverall Grade for The Godfather:     A+", "Glamorizing Scum and Vermon": "For certain,my review will be regarded with great disdain.Before I viewed the movie,I read the book by Mario Puzo.The similarities are right on target.Coppolla accurately conveyed the book to cinema in an engrossing style,however,I honestly believe that these bigger than Life characters were more suited for a documentary.The movie itself in a technical sense is excellent,but It's stature is overstated in the archives of movie history.The Mafia,never referenced,oh really,do we really have to struggle with this enigma,in light of the fact that Michael goes to Sicily,to hide from u.s.authorities,and the mob,He kind of got a surprise there.I find the adoration of the Don,Brando to be sickening and offensive.He is displayed as an arbritator of honesty and intergrity,a model to admire? Did this group forget the concept about when in Rome.A unique culture can effectively be blended into any society,providing they play by the rules of their host country.It is amazing to me,that such a small island nation,could have such a dominating influence or admiration in our western culture.Moreover,these thugs have done absolutely nothing in aid of their native home of Sicily,such a charming snake pit that has still not joined the 19th century.We now see a myriad of Mafias all over the world.If this is to be put in proper context,it is troubling to me,that we adorn and admire such cultures.I find the tributes to be troubling,not just in the movie making sense,but in it's implications to family values,and morality.I'm certain that the commercial revenues from this movie,could have assisted areas of the world that do not enjoy the privileges of our generation. On the movie again,I found the soundtrack beautiful,however,certainly a contradiction to the henous overtones and behaviour of the plot line and characters.There is even some morbid undertones that express love and loyalty.The only emotion I detected here was greed,violence,self-gratification,hideous marriages.The most contempt is explored in this group's demands for respect,that is an oxymoron.The mindset of this movie has caught up with today's corporate mentality of greed and power.Did this movie require more sequels,so that we could start reading a book from the last page and work our way to the beginning,Like \"Memento\".Your user ratings are engulfed with shallow praise for barbaric cultures.After this movie was released,every clown italian or not,was emulating the behaviour of these thugs,as if to pontificate their significance in the real world.There are a ton of movies past and present,that are more significant and artistic.I see no artistry in corruption,I only see an endorsement of bizzare behavious fabricated on a shallow premise.Whatever happened to love and sensibility?Are we compelled to view the ugliness and darker sides of our nature,and,if so,there is indeed no hope for future generations.I guess I will have to check under my hood every morning now,well that kind of say's it all!!", "An Offer You Can't Refuse": "A timeless masterpiece. A truly awe inspiring piece of cinema. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Very well directed with dazzling cinematography. Acting was superb and the script was flawless.I'd recommend this film to anyone, especially those who enjoy Scorsese's work with mobs like Goodfellas and Casino. The film is so enthralling you can not believe it came out in 1972. The camera work and direction of Capolla was truly amazing. It has such memorable and quotable lines. And another mention of the acting, because Pacino was unbelievable and so convincing as Michael. A defiant masterpiece, everyone should see this movie, at least once.", "This film is definitely an offer you can't refuse": "The Godfather is definitely my favourite film of all time. It is never boring. Brando's best. He won an Oscar. The film is absolutely irrisistible. It's original and is perfect on the telling of a mafia empire falling down because of a deal that was turned down. Pacino became a star for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. This is James Caan's best film and is the only film that got him an academy award nomination. Other people that became noticeable are Robert Duvall and John Cazale. For sure it is a 10. I recommend it to everyone. It is not a film to say no to because everything is going right down the line. I am sure it will not be a turn down. I am saying this because I know that it is one of the best films created. It was #3 on #100 of the afi's top 100 films list.", "The 2nd best Mafia movie": "I'm sure you may want to argue with me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This is a terrific movie on many levels. Pacing, Script, Lighting, Sets, Everything is top notch before you even get to the superb acting. This film demonstrates the ability to show violence in a shocking way and some people used it as a normal function of business. If you want to know what my #1 mob movie is...see Miller's Crossing. This is the best of the Godfather trilogy. Another bone you'll probably have to pick sometime. My favorite thing about the movie is probably the sets and locations. Choosing a favorite line is difficult. I appreciate the relative small use of profanity. \"He's been struck by the thunderbolt\"", "Honestly? It's a bit over-hyped": "Now, I have to start by saying I just watched it for the first time ever, so I am definitely looking at it with fresh, modern eyes. And that being said, I just don't see it. Maybe it was this masterpiece in its time, but I don't actually think it holds that well in today's standards.People seem to praise its directing and acting, but I don't really see how they are that special, to be honest. Goodfellas is definitely the better one at both of these. The directing and acting were good, yes, but a masterpiece? You can't even hear half of the words Marlon Brando speaks.The strongest point was the interesting plot and it is great, even if it lacked a few good twists. The story arc overall is good and Al Pacino's character goes through a good development. On the other hand, the pacing could have been better and one or two times it felt maybe a bit boring even. The runtime could have easily been cut by 10-20 minutes or the boring acts could have been improved.In general, I kind of didn't like how they romanticized the whole mobster life. And this is indeed why I prefer Goodfellas over this: that movie showed what kind of maniacs and psychopaths criminals and gangster must be to survive in that underground world. This made it look like anyone could have changed their career to become a criminal.Anyhow, it absolutely is worth a watch and it's one of the most important parts of cinema history and I am embarrassed to admit it took me all these years to watch. But I finally. And if you like well acted and well directed gangster/mobster/crime cinema, I would definitely suggest to also turn to Breaking Bad and Peaky Blinders (even though they are not movies, but series, they are the modern day masterpieces of directing and acting).", "Visually Imppecable and fundementally one of the best films!": "I actually have never seen the classic movie and was really impressed and understand why it holds the status that it does in American Cinema. The locations and set were beautiful and spot on with the theme. I thought everybody looked like they belonged perfectly. The legendary scene with Don Corleone where he is in his office on the day of his daughter's wedding. The lighting and shadows in that is really impressive. Another one of my favorites that show how a movie can take you on a journey. Forget about what's going on for a couple of hours. When Michael was in the bathroom of the restaurant and the train was passing by and you see him searching for his pistol. I think this is a great example of great cinematography, acting and writing all coming together to create a larger than life scene. Being in a theatre it emphasized everything by a ton. You could hear the train as if you are sitting in that restaurant. Notice all the lighting and shadows I was really impressed!", "A masterpiece.": "A masterpiece of a movie with great cast, very good script, good acting and directing. It almost feels like you are in the movie the whole time and you stumble upon these emotions surrounding love, loyalty and systemic hierarchy.The only thing about the movie I have a problem with is that it sometimes becomes very long-winded or boring in that sense, but if you have a good amount of time on your hands and a lot of snacks, it shouldn't be a problem at all.A 9.5/10 from me.", "A great analysis on culture, family, traditions and dirty business": "I think Francis Ford Coppola has delivered an amazing analysis on family traditions with The Godfather, which I consider his masterpiece.Considering that it opened in 1972, and analyzing all the violence-full sequences, it is not strange to read about it as \"shocking\" in several reviews.The Godfather and The Godfather part II are some of the movies you just HAVE to see. In part II, F.F.C. tells two stories: Vito Corleone's acension to power and Michael Corleone's new life as the new Godfather.I'd give them both an 11 out of 10.", "A reprise": "This is my second comment about this film - I am just pleased to see that there are some film fans with the sense to recognise that this motion picture is superior to any other.And that a lot of you are realising the true supremecy of James Caan as Sonny.Respect to everyone Any Godfather lovers out there feel free to E-mail me.", "A masterpiece in every sense of the word": "In my opinion this is undoubtably one of the best and one my favourite films ever made. What is surprising as anything is that two years it was followed by Part II which is just as good (and then 20 years later and money-grabbing, dull and unnecessary third film). The first time I watched this film, I thought it was very good but overly long. But the second time I watched it, it didn't seem overly long at all, but beautifully detailed and concise - despite being nearly three hours long. I didn't find myself become bored, because the remarkable thing about this film is that almost every line, ever scene adds to the story or unfolding the characters, and their interaction with each other. The acting is believable, the direction is superb, and cinematography excellent.As well as all this, the film avoids cliches and over-dramatising deaths, but instead shows the Italian culture and strong importance of relations with your family. The differemt characters seem to perfectly gel. Micheal who changes from being relatively uninvolved ('a citizen') to heading the family, Sonny -overly volatile, Fredo - not clever enough (he's more involved in the 2nd film), and Tom - the level headed, sensible lawyer, who doesn't let his emotions run away with him like the others. My only (slight) criticism of the film, is that the Scilly scenes didn't run as smoothly as the rest of the film. Although it was interesting to see where family orginates from (again the 2nd film covers this more), Micheals falling in love and then his newly-weds' death seem a little unrealistic. Well in didn't make as well sense to me in a way.In summary this is a brilliantly detailed and enjoyable film, if not as 'entertaining' as Armaggedon (supposedly) or other rubbish.  I can see how this film wouldn't be for all tastes, but anyone interested in the more 'classic' style which people remember for years to come, as well as the storyline, this is a MUST see. Also note its a good idea to watch Godfather Part II shortly afterwards, while Part I is still fresh in the mind, as they link together brillantly. 10/10", "Close, but not the greatest": "\"The Godfather\" is a visceral achievement in moviemaking and has a rightful place near the top of any list of the greatest films ever made. It seizes your attention, doesn't let go and takes you down the road promised to immigrants to America -- before taking a turn in which we confront the prejudices, mistrust and other roadblocks to the realization of their dreams, and how they went on to create success on their terms. But I have to put it near the top, not AT the top. That honor, on my list, belongs to \"The Godfather Part II,\" for a reason that it's hard to fault Coppola for. In \"The Godfather,\" I found Michael to be too far outside the family at the beginning of the movie. While not renouncing his father, Sonny or their enterprise, Michael seems to be more of an observer in an Army uniform with his white-bread girlfriend nearby than a family member PLANNING to immerse himself in the life his father and brother have chosen. Obviously Michael is drawn closer to his family as it becomes threatened with, then targeted by, violence. This is understandable but, to me, not foreshadowed by the life outside the family that he had chosen a few years earlier and seemed to be comfortable with. Of course, \"Part II\" gives a much fuller picture of how Michael got to where he was in running the enterprise, and heading the family. But we already know all we need to know about his motives and choices -- courtesy of \"The Godfather.\" This deeper, more realized character of Michael in \"Part II\" is the reason I rate it ahead of \"The Godfather\" -- but not by much.", "In American motion pictures, it's as authorative as its title role": "It's amazing to think, having listened to Francis Ford Coppola's DVD commentary, that his 1972 epic The Godfather was produced under such incredible studio and financial pressure \u0096 one can only imagine what this picture could have been if Coppola was given a little more control. To this day, The Godfather remains a classic, truly extraordinary, and etched into the memories of all who've seen it. It is one of the most widely acclaimed and financially successful films of all time, consistently among the top film lists of most, and is my personal favourite motion picture.Set in 1940's New York, The Godfather tells the tale of the patriarch of a mafia organization, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) \u0096 a man who commands enormous authority and power \u0096 and both his literal and figurative families. When the Don refuses a proposition by the drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo, believing that narcotics is \"a dirty business\", Sollozzo \u0096 backed by the power of a rival mafia family headed by Don Phillip Tattaglia \u0096 orders an assassination attempt. Don Corleone barely survives the shooting and, for the love for his father, Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) decides to take action, masterminding a calculated move that will forever draw him in to the life of crime he always wanted to avoid.The cast assembled for The Godfather can lay claim to being possibly the greatest ensemble ever featured in an American film. Marlon Brando's career-reviving turn as the Godfather himself has already cemented its place in cinematic history \u0096 no more needs to be said. Al Pacino demonstrates a remarkable transformation from idealistic youth to cold, calculated heir to the Corleone throne. James Caan as Sonny, the Don's eldest son, is as explosive, violent, and temperamental as the pages of Puzo's bestseller describe, and Robert Duvall as adopted son and family Consiglieri (Counsellor) Tom Hagen is all logic and composure. But the praise should rightly stretch out to all, even those in small roles, as all play a part in making Coppola's world of Italian culture and underworld crime authentic and believable.When I try to pin down what it is, exactly, that makes a motion picture a \"classic\", I can't help but return to the notion of how memorable it is. This is ultimately where The Godfather qualifies \u0096 just about everything in this film is memorable in one way or another. We remember the acting \u0096 there is not a more iconic performance committed to film than Brando's Don Corleone. We remember Gordon Willis' celebrated cinematography, from the shadowy, atmospheric tension created in the offices where \"business\" is dealt, to his presentation of the sweeping, sun-kissed landscapes of Sicily. We remember the beautiful themes of Nino Rota's score \u0096 the haunting, lone trumpet that opens the picture and the full- fledged orchestral arrangement of the instantly recognizable \"Godfather Love Theme\". And who could forget the masterful inter-cutting during The Godfather's climactic baptism sequence? From the opening shot of the thickly accented undertaker proclaiming \"I Believe in America\", to final unforgettable shot in the Don's quarters of the door closing on Diane Keaton, who finally realises the truth of what has happened, Coppola has attained a directorial quintessence with The Godfather that he may never again reach. While watching the picture, we simply cannot wait until the time comes to sit down and view it again. It's a rare quality in a film, and the hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece.", "Classic Mafia Movie!": "The Godfather is a classic film that has received widespread critical acclaim for its performances, writing, direction, and overall impact on the film industry.One of the most notable strengths of The Godfather is its cast, which includes powerhouse performances from Marlon Brando as the titular character, Vito Corleone, and Robert De Niro as his son, Michael. Both actors deliver nuanced and complex portrayals of their characters, with Brando's portrayal of the aging and increasingly vulnerable Vito being particularly noteworthy. The supporting cast is also strong, with memorable performances from the likes of James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Al Pacino.The writing in The Godfather is also noteworthy, with sharp and intelligent dialogue that serves to deepen the characters and advance the plot. The film's portrayal of the inner workings of the Corleone family and the world of organized crime is both convincing and engrossing, and the film's themes of loyalty, family, and power are explored in a thoughtful and nuanced manner.Director Francis Ford Coppola does an excellent job of bringing The Godfather to life, with strong visual storytelling and a commanding sense of style. The film's cinematography, art direction, and music are all top-notch, and the film's use of violence is judicious and effective in conveying the consequences of the characters' actions.Overall, The Godfather is a masterfully crafted film that has rightfully earned its place as a classic of the gangster genre and a benchmark for cinematic excellence.", "Loooking for something?": "Like gangsta,mafia,and drama? This is for you! Its a great movie and i thing the best movie of mafia at all!So watch it or i will make you an offer you can't refuse", "Kind of a shame...": "\"The Godfather\" is a good movie that should have been a much better one. It has almost everything it needs: a stellar cast, a story based on a bestseller, great music, lush cinematography, etc. It makes a kind of visual poetry out of many of its scenes. But in the end it lacks a soul. As a movie about the Mafia, it made its characters too lovable, whitewashing the brutality, hypocrisy, stupidity and sleaze of real gangsters. We like the characters too much; we want to be like them, deliver their lines. It leaves out even the few ideas that the book had. In the end it is a story well told, but eventually, a story about nothing (not in the Seinfeld sense, either.).", "The originator of gangster movies": "Representatives of Italian churches and triads 'successful people in the capitalist countries such as the United States have escaped, stolen, established, avenged, whitewashed growth history, and mixed the generation and destruction of family, love, and friendship in different situations. . Family interests are above everything else, and everything that is not conducive to the growth and development of the family must be eliminated. The coexistence of interests is the foundation of harmony, and the divergence of interests is the beginning of hostility. The death of the old godfather, the birth of the new godfather. Is the beginning of an unstoppable ending.", "An overrated masterpiece": "While certainly a little overrated, the Godfather still holds up as an amazing movie with some of the most iconic characters, moments and lines in all of film. The story is a crime drama that follows the leader of a massive crime family passing the torch to his youngest and most reluctant son. The genius and appeal of the story not only lies in its well executed structure and masterful dialogue, but also the realism and accuracy with which it tells a story about the mafia. However the film would be nothing without the characters and the actors that play them. Al Pachino is indeed fantastic in the film, and Robert Duvall is also good, but the film belongs to Marlon Brando. His performance as Vito Corleone is legendary and the character has become one of the best and most loved in all of fiction. This is an absolute masterpiece, though not quite the greatest of all time, and will remain a huge part of film history forever.", "Beautiful Composition": "This film really opened my eyes to the drama of beautiful cinematography and how compelling you can make an image simply with the framing. Having each shot tell its own story is an incredible element towards crafting an excellent film. In addition to the cinematography, I became a huge fan of Brando because of this film. I read that he used some personal techniques to craft his character and I really admire that now that I am looking for ways to make my own screen-time unique and dynamic. I wish films would continue to use The Godfather as a model for good cinema. There is something missing from modern movie-making that can be rediscovered by watching films like this.", "Power is not granted; it's been taken": "Shows powerful men's life. Its not just a movie for quickies. careful watching gives you glimpses of handling creatures of emotion and fear. its not exaggerated. But it is generally applicable in civilized society when leaders have emerged. Another interesting thing is usage of sound. A lot of sound and scenes are composed without dialogues. Light, silhouette, symbols of shadows are heavily used to 'frame' godfather. even you can hear a lot of family sounds without meant for any literal communication to the audience. baby cry, Italian conversations.. Bit lengthy and dialogue oriented. Only watch when you have peaceful time.", "A precise and flowing work": "Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a landmark of cinema.  The three-hour film is the result of an incredibly precise brand of filmmaking.  Despite the fact that the story spans a number of years and thousands of miles, there is a clear, very natural progression throughout the film (with the exception of a subplot or two).  The characters are complex and varied, each playing a specific role that contributes to the story.  The film does admirably well in keeping the story relatively coherent, despite its complexity.In the film, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a powerful crime family in New York.  He arranges killings and is involved in illegal gambling rings, among other things.  Yet to those who love him, he is known as a man of reason and justice.  He is the Godfather - a title of respect and endearment.  Many seek him out for his blessing, his advice \u0096 or a favor.  Despite the fact that he is, essentially, a murderer, the movie does an excellent job of making the audience respect him; the deaths he arranges are always justified in some manner to the audience.  They men killed are either other criminals - usually involved in narcotics and other crimes somewhat worse than the Corleones' - or are corrupt in some way, a danger to \"the family\" and probably murderers themselves.Vito's family has a hierarchical power structure.  At the top is the first-born, Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone (James Caan), hot-headed and vengeful, with a lust for power - he is inverse of the collected and methodical Vito. Then there is Fredo (John Cazale), the ambitious but ultimately incompetent son who is more interested in women and booze than the family business. Finally there is Michael (Al Pacino) - the youngest son who is clearly the central character throughout the film.Michael is a young World War II veteran who wants no part in his father's business.  His signature line is \"That's my family, Kay\u0085 it's not me.\"  He respects his father more than any other man, but he wants to live a different line.  He is a dynamic, fully-realized character that is absolutely convincing.  He is also a very different character at the end of the film - but in a way that is completely consistent with his personality.The film has an excellent pace.  There is an ebb and flow - the film begins rather slowly, then picks up the pace, and rises to the climax of the first act - and then the pace slows once more, only to build up suspense again to a final climax, in which all loose ends are neatly tied.  Never is the audience bored - the story keeps a tight grip on the viewer, ensuring that they wonder as to the fates of the characters even in the slowest parts - a remarkable accomplishment in of itself.The Godfather is a excellent film in every sense of the word - technically, aesthetically, in terms of story and characters, themes and music. It immerses the audience in a completely different - yet perhaps altogether to familiar - world.  It is a classic that is - and will be - rooted in film history.", "Well done": "The Godfather, an electrifyingly well made film. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, just naming the heavy hitting stars. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia family living in New York. The Don's main source of income is gambling and protection. Another head of another mafia family (Sollozzo) wants to sell drugs to gain profit, Don Vito hates the idea of selling drugs on the market, so an attempt to take his life is made. One special son of the Godfather is brought to light when this event happens. In the film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the films gives the viewer a feeling of sympathy for a mob family, when in reality, a person does not usually take the side of a mob family, doing things against the law to make profit. A couple of the ways this happens is the fact that it's felt that Don Corleone is trying to do the `right' and `honest' way to make his profit by not selling drugs. Also, by the death and injury of many family members, the film brings a feeling of understanding, sympathy, and compassion towards the Corleone's. The film includes numerous scenes of murder, often in an offensive amount. Some scene feature hideous lights jobs, to the point of not seeing the character's faces, or telling what is happening. Although very monotonous, the music and soundtrack the movie was well done, and really changed the feel of individual scenes. There was an excellent job of doing crescendos and making diminuendos of certain scene to build suspense, or foreshadowing an event. Overall, the acting was superb, great casting, very well conceived and structured plot. I give The Godfather 8.5 out of ten.", "Deserve all it's glory": "An old patriarch of a mafia family tries to submit his power to his son through violence and chaos. The Godfather is the typical mafia story, masterfully written by Mario Pulzo. Marlon Brando brilliant performance and a young Al Pacino great acting make this one of the greatest film of all times. Winner of 3 Academy Awards.", "Watch it in one sitting.": "This movie is widely regarded professional movie critics as one of the greatest films of all time.I myself am in one-hundred percent agreement with this assessment.Fifty years on from release what can I add to the canon of reviews that has not been said? This! For you young people (or anyone else) who have not seen it yet or seen it but not start to finish I say the following. Block out some time and watch it beginning to end on one of the streaming services. No watching it on AMC or TCM with all their commercial breaks. Dont watch it over two nights. It is long but to fully appreciate it, do yourself a favor, and watch it all at once!", "Yes, It's That Good": "This iconic film is a legend, and for good reason. The a thing, cinematography, plot, and script all as good as it gets. If you have any interest in film and haven't seen The Godfather you are doing yourself a great disservice. Go watch this film!", "True perfection": "I didn't think i would ever give a movie a 10. There is always something to say. I watched the godfather when i was younger and recently watched it again after 15 years. It is a true masterpiece. Everything is perfection. The characters and how they develope, the storyline and the way it is filmed. The olschool music is just the icing on the cake. I already liked it in my childhood, but fell in love rewatching it. It's just a trip through nostalgic perfection, enjoying every second of it.", "The Godfather review": "It's a very good movie, it's about family interests, family mafia, it could be said that a power struggle as well, there were scenes that really shocked me, the movie takes as well really unexpected directions, the perfomances were also very good, both Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and the other supporting actors.The different camera angles that were used in the scenes, the only thing for which i put one point less, it's because of the way the mafia works, like a monopoly and some things that the movie want you to asume, that three years passed, for example, like: \"wait, hold on, what happened here?, and those things.", "The God Father review. 10 out of 10!": "Phenomenal! One of the best movies ever made. Great acting! music, screenplay! Great directing. I can't express my feelings with just words. One of Hollywood's greatest films. It may take a many viewings to fully comprehend the film. I wasn't ready for what this movie had in store for me. This movie will pull you in each time you watch it. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story is great, the characters are very carefully chosen. Al Pacino's performance is very good.. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films ever. A piece of art which will live in the hearts of many, This film is a brilliant mob movie, that everyone should watch. Everyone I know loves this film. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give give great performances in their finest movie ever. The amount of work put in The Godfather is just amazing! I can feel each character's emotion in this movie. I give it 10 out of 10", "Godfather's power": "This is how I watched the movie.\nI watched first 1 hour then left as such since I was bored. After 3 months, I watched the movie again, this time I could enjoy it very much.\nThe movie is showing how powerful Godfather really is. No major plot twists or anything like that but it's a great gangster movie.\nThe movie is made up of many independent scenes, the first scene itself is catching.\nMust watch, a little bit lagging if seen for the first time, yet a good movie.", "A family tragedy": "Most filmgoers who rhapsodize over this wonderful film probably place an inordinate stress on the violence and the politics which connect not only one family, but several, in this sprawling tale of post World War II America. With apologies to those of Italian heritage, I think the tragedy of the Corleones is less a matter of ethnicity than their ruination by blood which is set in motion by two evils: greed and a lust for power. The film is one which sets off the family or clan, [the neighborhood as victim] against the larger, unforgiving American society. The characters are wonderfully realized and splendidly acted. They appear as if drawn to life for the first time. The sinister atmosphere of the film, from its great opening sequence to its frightening close, is a nearly three-hours-long treatise on the disintegration of a family. The Corleones are revealed as equal parts melting kindness and merciless vengeance. The Godfather's turning point is Captain McCloskey's unnecessary assault upon Michael. The meanness of the violent act unhinged the human ideal in the Don's young son. From Michael's understandable love and need to protect his helpless father in an unguarded, creepy hospital emerged his irrevocable decision to cast away any desire to become successful in the eyes of legitimate society. The slow, sure gestation of the plan to assassinate both Captain McCloskey and Virgil Solozzo is one of the major rewards for anyone who loves this film. The seamless transition of Michael Corleone from a patriotic, dutiful, obedient son into a cruelly vengeful and malignant weapon is terrifying portrait. The title of the movie applies to both Don Vito and to Don Michael, with the son slowly eroding the warm and loving family, painstaking built by the father, into a loveless, cheerless collection of individuals adrift on a sea of loneliness and treachery.", "An epic for all time": "I could watch this movie again and again.  Marlon Brando is spectacular, and you envy and pity the Corleones at the same time.  They seem to have such a strong sense of loyalty and family, yet they are constantly watching their backs and wondering when their time is up.  The struggle of the Corleones to eventually become legitimate is dramatic and sad, but beautifully portrayed.", "A divine masterpiece of acting and directing...": "When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let's be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather. Whether you like gangster-movies or not, this is one you can't miss!!!", "Yes, it is the best.": "I really it hate when I'm flipping with the remote and I come, once again, upon \"The Godfather\".  No, it's not because I'm bored with it after seeing it 1,000 times.  It's because it is still completely captivating and totally enthralling every single time I see it.  And, I can't turn away!  It is and always will be, my favorite movie (along with and equal to Part II).  As others have said, skip Part III.  Or, at least, enjoy it on its own terms and don't try to compare it to or even think of it as a part of a trilogy of Parts I & II. Part III is the \"Let It Be\" album of Francis Ford Coppola. (You Beatles freaks will understand).\"The Godfather\" is not a masterpiece.  It is THE masterpiece.", "Stunning!!": "It has the best elements from about every movie-genres. Some of the scenes are breath-taking. This was the first time I watched The Godfather even though I had the trilogy-box for months. My expectations was very high, so I've been waiting for the right time to watch. Today was the day. The Godfather overcame my expectations!! I will watch this movie one more time before moving to Part Two and Three. The Godfather need full attention. You can't watch a movie like this one on Saturday-evening with the kids running around the house and the wife vacuum'ing. This movie needs the right setting and you to be ready and in the right mood for one of the greatest movie-experiences. And I really mean it!! JG", "It doesn`t get any better than this": "This film will forever stand as the truly greatest of it`s time or of all time.You will not find a better movie anywhere and if you don`t think this film is great,well you got a serious problem. I thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for this film and I hope we will see Coppola back in action soon. The acting as well is brilliant and Marlon Brando as the godfather,he is just amazing.This film only recieved three Oscars and it should have got more. This is a film about the mob or the \"cosa nostra\" but it is also a film about family and friendship.It`s a very touching film and a very beautiful film. This is the ultimate film and I love it. So it doesn`t get any better than this and to all of you out there who haven`t seen it,you don`t know what you`re missing. This is the BEST!!!!", "An epic masterpiece": "After having watched the Godfather countless times, I have to say that it is (along with the rest of the trilogy) the best film/series of films I've ever seen.  My comments are on the series of films as a whole.Here are my main reasons for this assertion:1-The complexity of the plot which draws one in to an involvement with the film without the complexity being just for its own sake.2-The depth of characterisation of Michael.  The way he seems to inevitably to get sucked into something deep and serious when he initially seems ashamed of the family 'business'.3-The interlinking of scenes from present and past which adds something emotionally at certain points in the film. (eg. the flashback of Michael telling his family about him joining the army)4-the music which creates an amazing and authentic atmosphere.\nparts 1 and 2 merit a 10 and part 3 a 9. (part three is better than some have suggested I think)", "The Review of the Godfather": "The Godfather is one of the best important works in the history of the movies. It tells a story about the gangster.And it is the greatest gangster film of alltime. We can not only catch a glimpse ofthe life of the gangsters through this movie, but can know the principle that wehave to accept something we dislike, forthe duty, or someone we love.In the really life, we may have to accept something sometime, like the Michael.Maybe we may feel unhappy or angry. Butin a people's life, it's always the situationlike that, and we have to experience them.", "different thought": "A popular movie in this movie gives it a different thought", "Must watch before you die": "Must watch before you dieNo words can define this movie.", "second best film ever": "This is the second best film ever made.  Only \"The Godfather part 2\" is better.  Nothing else need be said, but since I ave to get four lines I will point out that Pacino's transformation in this film is one of the most moving performances in history", "Regular": "I don't know why this film became the most overrated movie of all time.\nTo me(and a lot of people), it was just a regular gangster movie, nothing more.", "Cinematic Masterpiece, obviously.": "I was lucky enough to watch this movie in the theaters a few months ago because of its 50th anniversary. At that time it was my second time watching this film, and it just gets better the more you watch it. I literally had goosebumps all over my body when the movie started. I can't just sit for long periods of times and watch something without doing something else, but with the godfather, i always sit still and watch.....great!", "Powerful hard hitting masterpiece!": "You may of heard that the godfather is meant to be this huge hitting box office Oscar winning best movie ever made, well it is. But you need to be one of those people who accept movies and like them for what they are, as the godfather lasts for over 3 hours. It never gets boring and is a huge surprise in the movie industry. It is great powerful and well acted. The certain kind of movie that shouldnt be missed. The story surrounds the Corleone family. There lives in the mafia world. It will leave you shocked when yo watch this movie. Don't miss it if you love movies. This is now known as the \"all time best movie ever\" And its great and fun to watch.10/10If you like this i recomend Goodfellas, a great movie that comes close.The Godfather is great see the whole collection \"Classic\"!", "Oh My Godfather.": "Al Pacino is a young and sullen US Marine named Michael, back from risking his life for his country in the Pacific Ocean, only to find his family has degenerated into an anti-American crime syndicate. Torn between patriotism and love of family, he decides to report the whole regime to J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. But when his father is shot (by Hoover's G-Men no less), Michael instead senselessly chooses to start killing Americans, including a Police Captain and a Turk. I'm sorry, but I couldn't understand the character's motivation in that scene, it was rude and it spoiled the whole meal, if not the movie. Otherwise I think you'll like it for the wonderful Sicilian scenery, the post-war N.Y. look, and for the scene where Sonny bangs his girlfriend against the door while his wife fumes, Tom laughs, Connie marries, Fredo slobbers, the Don waits, and Michael whines through his nose.", "Probably the best movie of our lifetime": "Hailed as the best movie ever by most people, and I tend to agree. We probably won't see a movie this perfect in quite some time. Everything from the casting to the execution of the finished film is handled with such precision it is truly astounding.I guess you are wonder why I wrote \"probably\" in the summary and well, let me tell you this: There is another movie that is if not better at least on the same level as this one. And the movies name? It ends with II.That Francis Ford Coppola was capable to pull this of at such a young age is awe inspiring and even more so when he did it a second time around. I mean how many movies have a sequel/prequel that is if not as good even better than the first one? Don't worry, you can count I will be right here waiting for you to finish. What did you find? Terminator 2, Lord of the rings 3, Toy Story 3, The Bourne trilogy and The Dark Knight? Well you would be correct and this shows you have rare it is when you think about how many sequels there are.", "More movies should have these qualities": "The Godfather, which hit movie theatres and wowed audiences over 30 years ago, is still arguably one of the best movies ever made.  Only the best writers, directors and actors could make a story about the mafia, who in the beginning seem to be cold, ruthless killers, and turn it into a group of people winning over the sympathy of nearly everyone in the audience.  This film wouldn't have been as believable or worth watching if it weren't for the great cast.  Their acting drew people into the movie.  Marlon Brando, who played Don Vito Corleone, was introduced to the audience as the \u0091Godfather', the leader of the organized crime family.  I loved how he was portrayed as an intimidating leader, but had a softer side for his grandchildren and his son, Michael, who he had a close relationship with. Throughout the movie, negotiations are made, bold-faced lies are told, families are torn apart, and several people are killed.  At the beginning of the movie, the viewer feels sympathy for Michael Corleone because he seems confused and not sure if he wants to join the business.  He makes up his mind to be apart of the business that will soon consume his life and because of that he changes as a person and the viewer no longer seems to identify with Michael and they feel a little bitter towards him.  He looses respect from the audience.  The camera angles added more attitude to the movie, giving it more symbolism. Sometimes the viewer is frustrated with the actors, knowing that if they had just made a different choice, things would have turned out the way the viewer wanted them to.  That's another thing that caught my attention during this film; I found myself upset with the characters and disappointed in them as if they were actual people.  I think that is a great quality in a movie.   I really liked how the viewer's feelings for Michael changed in the end.  It's a nice surprise when movies throw something like that in to spice things up and make the audience hope for a sequel.", "Spectacular! For the older crowd": "`The Godfather' is a spectacular movie, for the older crowd.  Between a quotable script, great theme music, and a fabulous main character, this film will keep the viewer wondering.  While watching `The Godfather', the viewer may recognize many lines.  Some of examples of those could be, ` I'll give \u0091em an offer he can't refuse,' or `Take it to the mattresses.'  Simply the fact that lines from the movie are well known, proves that this movie is worthy of watching.Throughout the movie, the same music is played over and over, but in different styles.  For example, if someone is about to get shot, the music speeds up, and almost gets scary.  When a happy time comes, the music gets softer, and more legato.Finally, one of the best things about this movie is the main character.  Al Pacino plays Michael, the child of the original Godfather.  After his father gets shot in a mob hit, Michael, takes over the family business, and completely changes who from the person he used to be.  Al Pacino is very believable in this role.Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a 9 out of 10.  It is definitely a movie worth seeing, but leave the kids at their friends, there is more gore than many would like.", "this movie no good": "I waste money on no good film. I write now because I mad.

There are so many spoofs and other movies that adapt or down right steal a scene or a quote from the Godfather. Watching this movie helps to explain a lot about so many others. The plot was intriguing, every event through the plot into a new turn. Like just when a person would think Vito has died and then he recovers against all odds. This movie is just like that. And Mike goes and guns down the cop and then flees to Italy. Nobody that hadn't seen the movie before would expect Mike to go and get married. Then at the most unlikely moment Sonny dies as he is going to help his sister and is gunned down at the causeway. And at the beginning when they chop off that horse's head as part of that `deal he can't refuse'.\n\tMike had not really get involved in his father's work up until that night after Vito had been gunned down. When he and the baker stood out front of the hospital to protect his father from being `finished off'. After that it was almost all down hill from there. He then killed the police chief and that mobster. After Sonny was killed and Vito recovered mike became the decision-maker in the family. Until Vito finally died, at that point (at the end of the movie) he became the head of the family. \tIn a way the movie revolved around him and things that effected him, Events that pointed him in a certain direction.

Yeah, I can see that.": "Yesterday, was the final day of my examination. A day I had been longing for quite some time. My teacher actually gave us an assignment to write an essay about my future career, but school businesses can wait. I got more important stuff to do. I went to my room, flipped open my laptop, and searched for a good movie in Netflix. Something caught my eye as I skimmed through the movie lists. There it was, Marlon Brando's face as the infamous mafia Don. With a vibrant looking rose just pinned in his suit. The Godfather was offering itself to be watched. An offer I can't refuse.The Godfather was cited as one of the best movies ever made. And so it was natural for my expectations to rocket to the sky. At that moment, I created a fictive challenge for the film to justify my expectations. I heard Brando's mumbling voice say 'Game on'. So I prepped myself for a 3 hour ride and pressed the play button.To praise it as a great movie would be an insult. It is a masterpiece, as was acknowledged by many people already. When I hear the word masterpiece, I can't help but envision an image of a grand luxury. The aging quality of antiques, the majestic stroke of paint on a canvas inside a gold patterned frame. The fact is, I saw these opulent features in The Godfather. Every scene shot in the movie feels grand. You feel all the splendor from the Corleone family slowly getting under your skin. The music is also a great help to the aura of the movie. It sets the tone with uneasy calmness that makes you respect the movie with all your heart.Of course all the beauty of the movie wont be complete with a great story. And The Godfather has a great one. It is about the daunting reign of the Corleone family in New York. They had strive under the leadership of Vito Corleone. However, now his time is coming to an end. His condition is getting worse, while the other families are getting stronger. The inheritance of the throne will soon take place. The throne was left vacant earlier than expected, however. Due to the failed assassination of Vito Corleone that left him in a coma. His son, Sonny, was next to the throne. But he too, was assassinated. This left his youngest son, Michael, a war hero, to step up. Despite his early reluctance, the thirst for revenge got the better of him. And once you stepped into the dark, the darkness will consume you. And thus, Michael decided to become the new Don of the Corleone family.The credits rolled. I closed my laptop slowly as I let my brain digest one of cinema's finest. I took my notebook out of my bag and placed it in the table across my bed. I pondered as what my future career will be. And I would be lying if I said being a mafia hadn't crossed my mind.", "Very Overrated.": "I don't see what so many others see in this movie. It is choppy, the characters are undeveloped, it is not very well acted, and it is boring. If I hadn't read the book, I don't think I could have followed the movie. There is little context in the movie story line without the book to fill in the gaps.", "The best for all time.": "with no doubt,the greatest movie of all time.loyalty,family relations,business,power,authority or enmity are all in the movie,but while wathcing they are all invisible,when it ends,you can feel them strongly.

The direction in the Godfather is superb and he acting in the movie is excellent, Marlon Brando gives us one of his best performances. Frances Ford Coppola makes the movie focus more on the family than on anything else and is much more than a gangster movie, it is more about family. The Movie is a film noir perfect in every way. 10 OUT OF 10.", "Best Movie ever created": "The AFI rated The Godfather the third best movie ever.  Only citizen Kane and Casablanca were higher.  I haven't seen citizen Kane, but I have seen Casablanca, and that can hold a very, very small candle to this masterpiece. In this movie nothing is gratuitous or useless.  The dialouge is perfect. Even though this is a three hour movie, all the scenes still stick in my mind.  Only great movies do that to you.  If you see it, you'll see what I mean.", "The Godfather is an American classic, because it c...": "The Godfather is an American classic, because it contains basically everything a great movie needs.  The flawless performances make the movie incredibly realistic, and the cinematography and score make The Godfather even more effective.  Practically everyone who watches it falls under its spell in the first or second viewing.  A film of such power deserves to be considered one of the greats.  However, the trip to Sicily is pointless and time consuming, which takes a point off the grade.RATING: 9", "Art in a Film": "Its hard to describe the acting in this film, but to me the acting was so artistic that it felt like I was watching moving art in a film metaphorically speaking. Even if you are someone who doesn't like gangster films, I feel like this film can be enjoyed by an audience of any genre. The way the story was acted out and slowly unraveled throughout the movie was beautifully done. My favorite character obviously was The Godfather himself, I can't picture any other actor being able to pull off what Al Pacino did in this film and this is one of the big reasons why is one of my top five favorite actors. This film had everything from romance, action, drama, horror ( in a way). One of the very few movies I ever watched and couldn't think of anything I didn't like about it", "THE BEST Mafia film of the century": "One of the only films I have seen that is perfect in every regard.... The Godfather revolutionized the gangster/mafia movie sub-genre and changed filmmaking forever! Would give 11/10 if I could.", "great": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.", "belief": "The film, at first glance, tells the story of an aspiring young man who degenerated into a Mafia boss. However, if you think about it more deeply, you will find that it is actually a process in which people choose between survival, integration into the environment and changing the environment so as to complete themselves. To go a little bit further, it's about how people's beliefs change people.", "Unique": "Among One of the best gangster movies And the characters are never forgotten by us", "Text": "This is the textbook of how to do gangster movies. There are more than 1000 movies am sure inspired by this movie world over by this epic. Acting, Cinematography, Makeup, Action name any department and this movie excels. Have watched it for more than 100 times yet it never fails to amuse me.", "Any man who must say \"I am the king\" is no true king": "Godfather is about mafia families and how they handle their business. We follow the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) is the head of family and a very powerful man while his son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) he tries to stay away from their dirty business. Marlon Brando was excellent in this film every time he was on the screen I was captivated. His facial expressions and his silent dominance is what you expect from a \"Godfather\". Remember any man who must say \"I am the king\" is no true king. You heavily see how important family is for a mafia man(and italian also) and how everything revolves around it. While Al Pacino portrays beautifully the son who slowly tries to learn the ropes of the job. The movie has heavy dialogues and the most scenes are people talking then acting for brief moment then talking again I really liked that , its not fast-paced not slow-paced either is just the perfect combination. Music was really good , I feel like if the music was not on point we will be talking for an entirely different movie whatsoever. Definitely a must see.", "eww": "Disgusting awful bad cringe. fsardhgfgvuhfafsdsafsaf\nsadsadsadsadfsafdsdfsaf\nfsdafdsafdsafdsafdsafdsa", "Very good mob movie": "This movie is not one of my favorite crime movies but it is still very good I never read the book but the movie is just amazing such as The Godfather 2.", "Best film ever about Mafia": "The Godfather is the best film about the Mafia that has been done so today. He not only accurately portrays the disputes against rival families. The film also shows the whole family psychology that involves the family and relatives and friends who live with the family of Don Corleone. The wedding scene is one of the best scenes in the film, kept showing the Italian traditions, even though the USA The scenes of struggle and war between rival mobsters is also taking the breath. This movie is one of the few sequels that had the same quality of the first movie without losing quality. Not enough watch the first film we got to see three movies in a row ... hugs", "Whats all the hype about???": "Honesly couldn't see what all the fuss is about. I felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film. Good actors boring story and even worse directing!!! Perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently, and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers, producers, and directors? I don't doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the 'God father' sorely outclassed. It is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay-day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it.", "The greatest movie of all time": "Nothing really can be said about these movie... it's truly the best of all time", "Legand": "That's a little to what the film says. The film is like a work of art. For the first time in a movie, I've seen all the actors play well. spectacular script and acting, management. A big hand for everything.", "Changed movies forever": "The original Godfather changed movies forever. The major studios became less important due to its indie makers. I cannot say anything about this film that has not already been said. It is a masterpiece with only its second part and Citizen Kane able to compare to it. The acting, writing, and directing are some of the finest ever to be recorded. Al Pacino peaked in this film with his subtle, yet absolutely effective, portrayal of Michael. Marlon Brando delivers one of Hollywood's finest performances, with the raspy voice and arched eyebrows. James Caan also found his perfect character in the emotional Sonny. Francis Ford Coppola does the finest piece of directing I've ever seen, and Puzo and Coppola's writing presents the audience with memorable characters. Sterling Hayden also steals a scene or two as the police captain. A film that defies time and repeated viewings.", "The best movie ever made": "There's nothing bad you can say about this movie, it's just that good. From the screenplay to the performances it is just perfect. There will never be another movie like this.", "Best movie experience I ever had": "This movie isn't just about mafia or crime or just killing people. Some people thing that this movie is only about violence (mostly female people ;) ). The movie is more about family, how the people in a family are connected together, how a complete innocent son, can become a very violent guy.It changes the way you look at mafia. Some think that mafia is just a group of gangsters that kill for money. Well, the movie tells you that it's not just that, there is honor. Of course, I'm not saying that they are right, but they aren't just a group of violent assassins. The music on the movie is very well made, the acting is fabulous, and Al Pacino is great. So is Marlon Brando. The movie starts at a good point and ends at a good point too. Some might think that it's not a good ending, doesn't explain enough. But I just love the way in which the movie ends, great music, great scene and great look on Kay's face. I know that there are people who will call this movie a boring one. I accept that it's long...very long, but it's necessary and it explains the entire story very good. Overall, it's a fabulous movie, the best movie experience I ever had. 10/10", "A perfect movie in every aspect.": "What can I say, an outstanding movie, certainly the best that I have ever seen.The Godfather depicts organised crime in a way that no other film ever has, or ever will. Although there is violence, it is put in very discretely- instead choosing to focus on the Italian family values that the Godfather and his heir, Michael, have adopted. It is a beautiful portrait of a seemingly happy family, with dark secrets. Eventually, the family suffers because of their underworld status, and Michael Corleone eventually takes over the family, with all of his father's wisdom, but with the ruthlessness of his late brother. The direction and the acting of the Michael character is exceptional. Al Pacino portrays him perfectly, and Francis Ford Coppola masterfully directed his transition from family rebel and sweet Westernised man to aggressive and ruthless kingpin of the family business.The music is another pivotal part of the movie. Nino Rota's famous main theme of the Godfather will stick in anybody's head for the remainder of their life. The lighting is also very well done, with the dark orange colour which adds to the overall effect of the movie.All in all, a brilliant masterpiece, with no flaws whatsoever, 10 out of 10.", "Piece of Art": "It is the end of 1945 (after the war), and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has returned from the army. This film follows his rise to Don of the Corleone mafia family, having originally said he wanted nothing to do with it.This film is one of my favourites because it is so masterfully crafted. The script is sheer perfection. The performances are golden. It will be extremely difficult for anyone involved in this production to say that it was anything less than the best film they have worked on. The only criticism I have is that I remember that I had to watch this film a second time, as I originally couldn't understand very much of what Vito was saying.Overall, one should not be allowed to die without watching this film. This, along with it's sequel (The Godfather Part II), are offers you can't refuse.", "Overrated. But nonethelesss epic": "I want to point out that there is a flaw in this movie which everyone seems to be flawless; when Sonny chases down his brother in law and beats him up he takes a swing at him and misses his face by more than a foot. I am surprised this was let go. For me it sucked a bit of magic out of it. Still one of the best films ever made but I wish people would stop calling it flawless", "Viewing is definitely recommended.": "Classics can be seen as old, intimidating, mostly black and white movies... The Godfather doesn't even glimpse at those characteristics, in contrast, it not only enthralls the audience, but also inspires other films relating to its topic.  The 1940s revolved around a tone that was dark, and uninviting to sympathy, while The Godfather actually triggers extreme emotion towards the, otherwise seen as, \"bad guys.\"  Characters that are seriously stereotyped take a new spin and actually make the viewer feel involved in the events of the movie.  Michael, an army man in search of pure separation from his family and the family business, is in love with Kay, a young girl full of life and enthusiasm for Michael.  While his older brother struggles to keep the family name intact.The characters themselves shine in the light of a great story, full of excitement and suspense.  Talks of war between families and the spread of drugs and gambling keep the viewer interested throughout the long film.  The viewer is hopelessly involved with the family, having had no interaction with any real people or in conversations.The Godfather is timeless with awesome actors and angles, the subject matter is rather heavy and it should be seen by parents before viewing by children. It is definitely a ten on a scale where that rates the highest.", "Best ganster drama": "One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.", "The Greatest Movie Ever Made.": "The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own.  But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone.  The Godfather is filled with a great storyline, beautiful acting, and a gruesome showing of the crime family.", "A masterpiece of cinema. One of the greatest films of all time.": "Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic \"The Godfather\", which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why. The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka \"The Godfather\", Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the \"innocent\" son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as \"Tom Hagen\" as the adviser to the Don. The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway. It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family. I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who haven't seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie \"you cant refuse\" to see. The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is \"Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely\".The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam \"Boom Boom\" Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time. This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family.", "It's not personal. It's business.": "This is a masterpiece of modern film-making. Coppola has managed to make his audience care about a Mafia crime dynasty, as we follow the inevitable transition of power from the venerable Don Vito Corleone (Brando) to the youngest of his three sons Michael (Pacino). This was something that the ageing Don never wanted for Michael, wanting to see him legitimised as a Senator or a Governor, but fate and the violent nature of their chosen profession steps in. Impulsive and violent eldest son Sonny (Caan) is duped and gunned down in a drug war, and middle son Fredo is overlooked as he is just not Don material. Michael, however, is his father's son, and his path into the family business is partially forced on him after an attempt on his father's life. Humiliated and beaten by the New York Chief of Police (who is in the pocket of a rival mafia Family), his life changes when he makes a character defining decision to take revenge on both the Police Chief and a rival narcotics trafficker named Sollozo, who, having made the attempt on the Don's life, must now see it through or forever be a marked man. Michael completes the task with a steely eyed determination, and murders both men in a chilling scene in a family restaurant. Michael is then forced to flee the USA to hide in Sicliy under the protection of a friendly Mafia family. His character is further developed after he falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian peasant girl, who is mistakenly murdered when his enemies track him down to Sicily. When Michael returns to America, he is not the same man that sat in his sister's wedding celebration at the start of the movie. He is older, wiser and surrounded as he has been by death and betrayal, those intervening years have been crucial to his character development. Like his father before him, he has chosen his path and has become a Don in waiting. This is an accolade that the older Don Corleone does not wait long to pass on to him, and although the old Don is still alive (surviving the five bullets Sollozo's assassins hit him with) he hands over the reins of power to Michael. Michael, now at the head of the business, accelerates the nefarious activities of the family. He seeks to relocate them to Nevada, but must tie up his New York business, split his territory between his Lieutenants Tessio and Clemenza fairly and settle old scores first. He uses his father as Consigliari, and Tom Hagen, the Families lawyer and Consigliari is quickly sidelined both because, as Michael tells him, he is not a wartime Consigliari, and because he needs his hands clean after the family re-settle in Nevada. The Assassination / Baptism scene is unparallelled, as Michael cuts down his enemies with a ruthlessness that maybe even the old Don did not possess, perhaps the reason why he stepped aside. These scenes are an interlinked series of brutal murders as Michael wipes the slate clean and assassinates anyone and everyone who have opposed the family. The genius is that the murders are interspersed with cutbacks to Michael standing as Godfather to his sister Connie's child, in Church, renouncing evil and Satan, as his Capo's and button men rampage through the remaining heads of the other five families. It is truly breathtaking film making. There has never been a better or stronger collection of actors ever assembled for any film before or since, and the dialogue is as memorable as anything ever committed to the page. There are no weak spots in this movie and the point to consider is that even though this is a film made against the background of crime and violence, and these play a huge part in what unfolds, it is essentially a film about family and loyalty. When the Corleone's decide to take murderous revenge on the heads of the other families, you do not turn from the screen at the savagery which is undoubtedly there to be seen, but instead, you root for Michael to be successful. There are simply too many memorable scenes to recount, but the final scene played out immediately after Michael orders that a Doctor be called for Connie because she is quite rightly hysterical (he has had her husband Carlo garroted out of revenge for Sonny's death) where Kay watches Michael's Capo's pay homage to him by kissing his hand/ring, while his Chief assassin, Neri slowly and deliberately closes the door in her face is the best ending in cinema history. I will end by stating that the Godfather II, is, if it were possible, even better. You will not regret watching this movie. It will stay with you for a long time after the final credits have rolled.", "Epic gets caught up in itself...": "Few other films revel in their sheer pompousity as 'The Godfather.' I must say that I do not dislike this film; it is a classic and deservedly so, and still one of the best gangster movies. Its just it tends to take itself too seriously, and you can't really relate to the characters. Don Corleone is not as violent and ruthless as expected (he fails to take revenge after Sonny's death). It would have been more thrilling to watch the Godfather carry out a brutal payback executive or unparalleled brutality.The film was too slow and long for my tastes, and lacked action and suspense. The best scenes include the scene where Al Pacino has to kill an enemy of the family, near the end when Don Corleone dies and of course the memorable 'Machine-gun death' of Sonny.", "Still the benchmark for character driven films": "Legendary performances that remain some of the best ever given from an all-star cast, iconic cinematography, and some of the absolute best, most human character development that ever made its way to a screen.Adaptations aren't usually this faithful or brilliant. This movie and the book it's based on influenced society for a reason, they are landmark achievements. Very, very few movies feature characters that bring so much to the screen, and the study of power in The Godfather series will forever be etched in history for its brilliance.The 1970s was the decade for films as art, more than any other decade. It's a shame that the modern era is dominated by the likes of The Avengers.", "Sorry Shawshank": "Still the best. All gangster films and tv shows wish they had the class Godfather does", "An unmatched classic!": "Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.", "Nothing To say.": "This is most movie spots to be watched\nBest movie ever", "Not to my taste": "For some reason I got bored, couldn't watch it all the way. Maybe a few years later I'll try again. People always change. Maybe then I'll like it. The acting and all are certainly good, it's only the storyline that is not to my taste in my opinion.", "The movie": "The best movie ever made, real gangster strategy. Similar to Miller's crossing.\nMicheal Corleone is an ordinary, quiet Ivy league alumni, which is about to change when his father is wounded in a assassination attempt. Being a decorated war hero, and knowing truth about his family business he decides to take control of the situation by implementing an ingenious plan.", "Amazing film": "The Godfather is One of the most great films in the world.", "Kinda Impartial": "Well, it is no.1 on the list, and on many others, very influential an all. But I have trouble seeing this as the greatest movie ever made.\nSure it is good, excelent even, but not at all close to being the best. I feel there are other movies that are more better, some of which came before The Godfather, and are generaly more important. I hope I can understand why this is what it is soon.", "Godfather, the best movie of all times? Gimme a break...": "Godfather the best movie of all times, and the only movie worth a 9/10, and Godfather 2 the third best movie?? Come on..., the Godfather series has its moments and especially the first one is not a bad movie at all. But, IMHO, almost all the other major movies about Mafia (especially \"Goodfellas\" & \"Once Upon a Time in America\") are, more interesting and better art too than the bombastic Godfather series. I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards.And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much: it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the \"wild & free\" life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography \"Run, baby, run\" because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that. Sadly, it is often the same with movies. You think Quentin Tarantino is so popular among the masses because of his artistic merits? You think wrong.", "The epitome of great cinema.": "`Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,' remarked Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando. By reading that quote, one might have thought that Vito was a virtuous and wonderful family man. However, he was the Godfather to the most powerful crime family in New York who dealt with murder every day. Little by little throughout the film, the viewer easily bought into the myth of the mafia: the family togetherness and their rich traditional background. But, director Francis Ford Coppola also exposed the viewer to what actually goes on in the mafia: death, blood, and calculated murders. Coppola used the elements such as camera angles, lighting, editing and dialogue to compare and contrast the myth versus the reality if the mafia in the scenes in the film, which were the events during Connie Corleone's (Talia Shire) wedding, the baptism of her child and the confrontation between Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his abusive brother-in-law, Carlo (Gianni Russo). Before the Corleone family lures the viewer in, they should take into consideration what is actually going on. \tA drastic difference between the reality and the myth of the mafia was blatantly expressed during the scene in which Connie Corleone got married. While everyone gathered around outside for a traditional, family oriented Italian wedding, the inside of their Corleone compound hosted crime negotiations between Don Vito Corleone and various members of his crime family. Outside of the compound, the Corleone family members gathered together to sing traditional Italian songs, wore traditional and classic wedding attire, danced joyously and took the family picture. Meanwhile, indoors, Don Corleone granted favors for the wedding guests, these favors often involving murder. To contrast the two scenes, Coppola implemented them with camera angles. Outdoors, the camera angle represented an onlooker and followed the festivities during the day. This gave a sense of belonging to the audience, and helped them `buy into' the myth of the mafia. Simultaneously, during the negotiations indoors, the camera angle represented Don Corleone's point of view. This made the viewer realize the intensity of the mafia and the importance of the role of the `Godfather' because everyone gathered around Vito and was humbled by his presence. Also, Coppola contrasted the scenes by the use of lighting. For example, outdoors, the lighting was very bright and there were barely any shadows. This created an air of happiness and showed the audience how the family made each other happy. In contrast, indoors, everyone and everything was cast in dark shadows to show the dark underworld of what was actually occurring in the mafia. \tAnother scene that showed a comparison of the myth versus the reality of the mafia was the baptism montage. Coppola ensured that this scene was implemented by using an editing technique called parallel action, in which two scenes are shifted back and forth to compare and contrast. In this example, the parts of the scene undergoing parallel action were when Michael was witnessing his godson's baptism and when the murders of all of the Dons that Michael had planned were being executed. At the baptism, the Corleone's proved their family togetherness and showed their belief in God. Michael even renounced the devil and pledged his allegiance to the church. However, he knew that as he as saying this, the murders he had planned were taking place. The brutal murders obviously showed how fiercely protective the mafia is and also served as irony, considering that Michael was renouncing Satan as people he ordered to die were being slain. In the order that the scenes were placed proved how both aspects of the mafia were considered to be alike in some ways to Michael. For example, the dripping of holy water off the baby's head and the dripping of the blood of the victims and the crying of the baby and the murders blended together to show how they were perceived as being quite mixed up and distorted in the heads of the mafia. \tLastly, a scene that contrasts and compares the myth versus the reality of the mafia was the confrontation between Michael and Carlo after his child's baptism. Coppola accomplished this comparison chiefly by the use of dialogue. Michael explained to him how he knew of his beating Connie and his plan to kill Sonny. After Carlo obviously feared for his life, Michael gently explained that he would only banish him off to Las Vegas and that he wasn't allowed to partake in the `family business'. He then said that he would never make his sister a widow, rather kill the father of his godchild. This showed that Michael had family values and prioritized his family over his `family business'. Then, Carlo was escorted to a car, and then strangled. The reality of the mafia, in this case, was that they would deceive anyone to achieve revenge and wouldn't let anyone stand in their way, even their families. \tI believe that the mafia isn't all about killing and crime. The people involved truly believed that they were doing the best they possibly could to protect their families, even if that meant murdering people along the way. However, I admitted that while watching The Godfather, I bought into the myth of the mafia. I found myself legitimizing the terrible events that Michael had orchestrated because his was trying to carry on his father's legacy and to protect his beloved family. This was a product of Coppola's intent to create almost a `home video' from the Corleone family: the frequent murders were as essential to them as their lavish weddings and their family dinners. So, if a viewer heard the quote, `\u0085a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man' might think that Vito Corleone is incredibly enraptured with his family\u0085 but which one?", "I rate it 12!!! on a scale of 1 through 10": "Everytime I watch this movie I feel the need to go into my back yard and build a shrine to Francis and Marlon...

The brilliance from all of them is just different. The way the portrayed each character and how well the director did. I'm starting to think i might become an actor after watching this.", "The ultimate depiction of America's obsession with power": "Mario Puzo's book The Godfather is one of the greatest works of fiction this country has ever produced, and Coppala brings it to the screen almost perfectly. Both the book and the film have been so popular, in my opinion, because they provide a stylistic and romantic view of power-a subject which we Americans have always struggled with. Most Americans (especially men) like and admire Vito and Micheal Corleone. The fact that they are criminals doesn't bother us at all. Usually a character must be empowered by the law or seeking justice in order for us to sympathize with him or condone actions we normally view as evil. That is not the case with the Corleones. We like them because they are powerful in and of themselves. The actions of the Corleone family are sometimes motivated by revenge, but more often the goal is to simply gain more power. We excuse them of murder because we see them as being outside of and above the law.\nThe reason that this film is so appealing (beyond the phenomenal acting, the wonderful quotes, the artistry and originality or the director, etc.) is because deep down, most of us want to be Vito Corleone. We want to be powerful enough to protect our families and our friends. We want our enemies to fear us. We want the money that goes hand in hand with such power. (You'll notice, that in all three Godfather stories, the power brings in the money, not visa versa.) Sure, most of us would rather come by it honestly, but in the end we just want that kind of control. For most of us, Vito Corleone embodies the American dream.", "essence of cinema...": "We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of \"The Godfather,\" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.", "Glorifying criminals and their lifestyle.": "I really don't understand why some people loved it so much. I agree acting by all actors is outstanding, but this movie is about a crime family and it glorifies the criminals of the society. Criminals are volves of society which prey upon sheep (good people) of the society,they use evil and immoral ways to become rich and powerful. Criminals must not be glorified. Please stop promoting such crime movies. All crimes movies should show a terrible fate of criminal who either has to spend rest of life in jail or is given suitable puinishment for his or her crimes. I did not live the movie as it glorifies lifestyle of criminals.", "Simply one of the best movie ever made.": "No words to say about this masterpiece. The art of film making.", "Gangs of Wasseypur replica- Gangsta movie": "I can say that this movie is a sophisticated version of Gangs of Wasseypur and if you like watching crime world then you'll love this film.I personally don't like gangsta movies because they do not have much respect for their women. Though I liked all the Italian accent in this movie.", "Great direction, acting and plot": "Amazing acting, amazing direction and screenplay. Marlon Brando at the top of his game with what could be the most recognized performance in movie history. The Godfather introduces us to a very talented cast with a initial wedding scene that presents us with all of the different personalities that are part of the Corleone family. The plot of the movie revolves around Michael Corleone, a role taken by a young Al Pacino personally picked by Francis Ford Coppola even when the studio heads wanted someone else for the role. It was Al Pacino's big break deserving an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. This movie is first about family, secondly about power and politics and lastly about necessary violence...all summed up to make for a very special movie, one of the best ever, if not the best.", "LOVE": "One of the best movies of all time, so much talent behind and in front of the camera!", "This can be the ultimate display of perfection": "One of my absolute favorite films of all time. A masterpiece without any compare in its genre. Please note that there is not one detail to complain about in this film. As much as I love Part 2 the original is in a class for itself. 10 out of ten .. no doubt.", "Not very impressed-awful": "Sorry, but i can't believe that this is the most popular film, it dragged on for so long i didn't even see the ending. Don't get me wrong, i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time Al Pacino shot the 'Bad' copper i had to turn off.The storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didn't care about whatever happened to the characters. How stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemaker's bed, he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind?I can't think of any reasons why this was a good film, if you do then you better tell me!!", "Insane Performance": "When reviewing a classic masterpiece like the Godfather, it is hard to believe that there is still something left to say. Well, to me , movies are all about performances and how a viewer can relate to a character. I am fascinated with actors. Marlon Brando has showed us that in order to be believable one has to search deep down his soul even look for a crazy version of himself in order to deliver a believable character. Directors should give the freedom to the actor to deliver a character that has to come somewhere from within the actor himself. Any judge of talent in an audition will tell you that a performer has to lay down his emotions on the floor and be true to himself so that the audience can feel his truth and relate to it. Marlon Brando has just showed us what acting is all about. The Godfather is now , thanks to Marlon, a man who knows that by lifting a finger his will shall be executed and the \"scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day\"...Marlon Brando doesn't need to convince us how powerful the Godfather is, we are already convinced , he won us in just a few lines. Now we believe he is trying to bring Bonasera back to the \"family\" under his power and to the business of trading \"services\". The magic of the Godfather is right here and there.", "THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!": "I hope they remake this movie maybe then that nonsense will stop, but then again once is enough. I swear people just claim it to be the greatest of all time because it's the COOL thing to do, most of them probably haven't even seen it. It's long (really, really long), boring and pointless.

That's how I describe `The Godfather'.  Every aspect of this film is dripping with intellect.  The directing, the writing, the cinematography, and the acting.  And all the elements of the film are woven tightly together to make a very entertaining package. \tThe intricate plot follows the development of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and the enthralling drama that pursues his `family'.  The script does the impossible task of capturing the complex politics of organized crime, and makes it interesting to boot.  The plot leads the audience along its windy path where it comes across many peaks until it finally builds to the fantastic finale. \tTo achieve this famous finish, the director employs the use of some pretty clever technical tricks.  To achieve suspense, he cleverly places the camera at angles that leads the audience one way, until he surprises them with the real result later on.  He also infuses the sound of the church organ music and the crying baby, and then gradually increases the decibels subtly and effectively.  That technique pulled the viewers in and made their knuckles white during the climax of the film.  The director was skillful in his mastery of all the film's techniques and in getting what he needed from the actors. \tThis strong cast of cast of actors included Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Conn.  Each actor portrayed their characters profoundly.  Marlon Brando executed method acting techniques in a way that only a veteran like Marlon could.  Al Pacino clearly shows his character (Michael Corleone) grow and change.  His acting is subtle, confident and quiet until it explodes in an awesome rage. \tMichael Corleone is much like the entire movie.  `The Godfather' is subtle and complex, and it builds to the memorable finish.  `The Godfather' stimulates the mind and starts the blood and adrenaline pumping in anyone who watches it.  That is why I recommend this beautiful masterpiece to anyone and everyone with a thirst for quality film.", "A stellar cast for a timeless, brilliant and spectacular classic film": "A stellar cast for a timeless, brilliant and spectacular classic film. A milestone set in the history of cinema by three big names: Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The best Mob film ever made, pioneering in many aspects: camera movements and shots, poetry of light, actor's work in pauses full of meaning and tension. The work of production designer Dean Tavoularis and costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone were very meticulous and truthful and created that impact of truthfulness that served as an indispensable support in the unraveling of the intertwining of a terrible and shocking but tender at the same time story, always exciting.

Don Vito Corleone is a wise, benevolent patriarch to the Italian American community of New York, and gets into trouble with rival gangsters only because he refuses to take part in selling heroin. Unless you have been told that he is a criminal, you'd never know. You certainly never see the Corleones cheating or hurting honest citizens. That's what I mean when I say that the movie is crooked.Compare the Corleones to TV's Sopranos. Tony Soprano is overtly criminal-a brutal, thieving, murdering, adulterous extortionist who pretends to adhere to a Mafia code, which he breaks whenever it suits him to break it. This is why The Sopranos is artistically superior to The Godfather. The creators of the Sopranos have actually dared to make Tony Soprano and his fellow criminals hateful, which is just what you would expect real criminals to be. Don Corleone, on the other hand, resembles a real human being about as much as Tarzan of the Apes.So, great as The Godfather is as an entertainment, it fails as art.", "As close to a perfect movie as there's ever been": "This one has it all. The casting, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the plot twists. It is simply almost above reproach.

The directing is excellent, the scenes are really beautiful, the dialogue is of very high standard, but most of all: the acting cannot be compared with anything I've ever seen on film (perhaps with the exception of the follow-up \"The Godfather, part II\").Marlon Brando is always Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino is almost as good. The Godfather is not just a cool gangster movie, it is also about how fragile life is and the impossibility of having total control over a situation.The war between the New York mafia families shown in this movie is similar to most struggles for power, both on a smaller and a larger scale.", "The Hollywood Family: Part 1": "Francis Ford Coppola's movie about the Corleone family is the story of the ultimate Hollywood family. Although \"The Godfather\" has lost some of it's original steam. In 1972 the causal treatment of violence was beyond shocking. With films like \"Natural Born Killers,\" \"Goodfellas\" & \"Pulp Fiction\" (any Tarantino film for that matter) savage violence done in an \"every day life\" manner is no longer as shocking. Although there are a few scenes that stand out, even today. When Michael Corleone paid back those gentlemen for the attempted murder of his father. That is one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. And of course the scene were one of Mr. Ed's comrades makes a cameo. The most amazing thing to myself is how much of a family this really is. The Corleone's love each other, and that shines through above everything else in this film. But even with all it's greatness it lasted too long. So this great film just doesn't make the 10 cut for me. 9 (would be 9.8) out of 10.", "Believe the hype.": "I remember when I was about 13 when I first watched the Godfather. I turned it off after half an hour. Three years later one of my friends had it on video. At first I was reluctant to watch it, but I became entranced by what I saw. Not only did it contain probably the best ensemble cast I have ever seen(Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Shire), but it is also one of the greatest stories in modern cinema. The predominant theme in this film is not violence or power as some might say it is, but family. Without giving the film away, the most moving and evocative parts of the film are when the members of the family are involved. I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Brando's work (Apart from 'Apocalypse Now'), but he deserved an Oscar here, for one of the greatest performances of our time. Caan, as the explosive 'Sonny' should have got 'Best Supporting Actor' too, as well as other magnificent performances by Pacino as Michael, and Duvall as Tom. Watch this film, you will NOT be disappointed. The greatest film ever? Probably-a definite 10.", "20th Century Shakespeare at its finest.": "I am one of those dorks who knows virtually every line to this movie? Why? Because the characters move with that timeless, understated intensity that no other director gets quite right.

We despise Tattaglia, Brazzini, Carlo-everyone who threatens the dynasty.And of course it ends with sublimely just revenge.

It was released in 1972 and there is hardly any doubt in my mind that it has truly stood the test of time. It is a brilliant adaptation of the bestseller novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo.The Godfather is a gangster movie set in the late 1940s & early 1950s around the lives of the Corleone family. Corleones are an Italian American Family in New York headed by 'Don' Vito Corleone. Vito has three sons, Sonny, Fredo & Michael and a daughter named Connie who is married to Carlo Rizzi. He also has an adopted son named Tom Hagen (German-Irish) who is the 'Consiglerie'(Advisor) of the family. The family is into the business of gambling, unions & liquor. They have all the judges and politicians 'in their pocket'. The Corleones also have influences over the media & the cops. They form a crime syndicate of 5 Italian- American families who have a stronghold over different parts of New York. Vito is assisted in his work by his 'Caporagemes' namely Clemenza & Tessio who carry out his orders.The family is faced with problems when the refusal of Don Vito to join & support the drug business along with Virgil Sollozo leads to other families (Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracchi & Cuneo) going against them. The bad blood between the families results in Don Vito getting shot. Sonny, (The 'hothead')who is the eldest son gets killed and Michael has to step-up in this time of need. The emergence of Michael who was earlier reluctant to join the family business as the head of the family is the highlight of the movie. Michael imbibes all the unique qualities of his father and takes revenge for his family. I don't know where to begin with as far as appreciating this movie is concerned. It has the most amazing characterizations with all the characters being well etched and having their own individuality. If Vito was the 'reasonable man' who valued his family, Sonny is a hot head, Michael is rational, Fredo is weak & stupid, Tom is measured, Sollozo is ruthless. Even the supporting cast of Clemenza, Tessio, Don Barzini, Connie, Captain Mcklusky, Jhonny Fontaine,Jack Woltz,Mama etc are extremely well defined. The dialogues in the movie pack some serious punch. Some of them which I can recall on my fingertips are \" It's not personal Sonny, its strictly business\", \" Only don't tell me that you are innocent , because it insults my intelligence & it makes me very angry\" and finally \" I'll make him an offer he cannot refuse\". The screenplay seamlessly gels with the movie. Who can forget the scene at the Louis restaurant, the baptism scene at the end, or Tom Hagen informing his Don about Sonny's death. The movie has got this whole Italian milieu which takes you in a different world, makes you feel like a member of the Corleone family and identify with each and every character. Last but not the least, a tribute should be paid to the entire cast of the movie. No one could have acted better than Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael, James Caan as Sonny or Robert Duvall as Tom. Even the performance of the supporting cast is phenomenal.I would like to sincerely thank Francis Coppola for putting up such a gem of a movie which has really caught my imagination.", "Super played": "One of the best ever and it actually showed the reality of the fake personality of public elected politicians and real mafias", "Best film of all time": "This movie is a definitely best movie. Everything includes in this movie are just perfect. The acting, the theme, the score, the Cinematography and the lighting, I can't write it's greatness.

Great acting, great mood, great everything.  This is basically a perfect picture.  Francis Ford Coppola brought together everything and made the film very realistic.  And let's not forget Al Pacino's stirring performance as Michael Corleone.  Great flick. Too bad George Kennedy's not in it.", "One of my favourite films and a masterpiece.": "When I saw Al Pacino in Scarface, I liked his acting and I was eager to watch The Godfather because Al Pacino was there. It was so beautiful. It's not just about just any random gangster films. It's about a man named Vito Corleone, a man who do other people's favour, a man who believed in America. Those whom the Don helped called him \"The Godfather\" because they are indebted to him. When an attempt on Don's life happened, his son Michael decided to kill the man who shot his father through the support of Older brother Santino. When that happened, He is forced to flee the country because the war happened and Don Corleone was recovered from his gunshot wounds but decided to hand over his empire to Michael who returned to the country after Santino's death and learning that his father is sick.The acting especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino was highly acclaimed. The story which is delivered by Mario Puzo and the screenplay which is delivered by him and Francis Ford Coppola were breathtaking. When I read the book, several scenes I saw in the film were on flashback like, Kay, played by Diane Keaton, shows the about the Don Corleone's Shooting to Michael, Don Corleone's youngest son, played by Al Pacino, were shown before the chapter the shooting of Don Corleone occurred in the Book but in the film Don Corleone's shooting were shown first before Kay revealing the newspaper that occurred Don Corleone shooting. I was praising the direction by Francis Ford Coppola. It was so awesome.I always watch this film because it always been my favourite films.", "Fantastic Adaptation.": "This movie is truly a masterpiece; the story is riveting, the momentum and pacing are marvellous, the characters are interesting and it really does pay off what it sets up, however, it would take me forever to recite the list of pros. I do have a few criticisms though; this movie, while leaving out some elements from the book were a good call(such as Fanucci and Johnny Fontain's full story), my sisters say that Vito's death isn't as tragic and Michael's arch isn't as slow burn in the film due to the decision to keep out some of the scenes relating to these 2 concepts, but I think that the scene before Vito's death was enough for the movie and the swiftness of Michael's development was justified, however, they should have ties up Fabrizio's sub-plot better. Overall, spectacular film.", "Der beste Mafia Film der Welt": "Ich bin der Meinung das der Pate der beste film ist wenn es um Mafia filme geht die Handlunge ist einfach super die anfangs scene ist Leg\u00e4nder und es ist super zu sehen wie al pacino langsam zum Mafia boss wird Ein muss f\u00fcr jeden Film Fan und erstrecht f\u00fcr jeden Mafia Fan", "It is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema": "I think that whatever I say, I do not give this great movie its due.

The Godfather is based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. \"The Godfather\" still ranks second on the IMDB, behind \"Shawshank Redemption.\".

Just a perfect cast, everyone acting amazingly well.Soundtrack: This is one of the things why this movie is my favorite, the soundtrack is perfect, amazing, epic, and it falls short. It's great how it generates a touch of fear, epicity and just by closing your eyes with the background music, you think you're in a classic Italian theater.Plot: It is the best movie that perfectly combines gangster movies and melodrama. A perfectly developed plot, which leaves no one indifferent. That scene near the end where Michael is in the church along with the revenge scene and the background music, or the final scene where his wife is seen in the foreground and Michael in the background receiving his new \"executioners\" and accepting that he is the new godfather. Perfect.", "My number 2 movie": "There is a reason that films are called the greatest, and The Godfather proves it. Coppola paints a chilling picture of the Corleone family, while the cast, particularly Brando and Pacino are unforgettable. If you haven't seen this movie, then \"whats the matter with you\"?", "Miscellaneous": "When Michael and Fredo drive up in Vegas to meet Moe Green, that clearly was not Fredo in the car. Could have got a better stand in with the same receding hairline.", "Antitrust in The Godfather": "We often hear that what the Feds nail mafiosos on is tax evasion, rather than the substantive underlying illegal commerce. What if it was antitrust instead of tax?Gangland is exactly where you'd expect to find anti-competitive behavior, working in the shadows to extract rents. After all, unfairly treated competitors can't complain to the authorities; their recourse is instead only to violence. What's more, those competitors are often themselves taken out of play by the government, whether through transparent corruption (e.g., the legislatively and executively sponsored \"war on drugs\") or through opaque corruption (e.g., bribery of corrupt cops by competing gangs). Thus, the very illegality of the products in which gangs traffic makes for government-granted monopolies that incentivize the illegal behavior.As much trouble as these monopolies and oligopolies cause for incumbents, they're even more of a headache for insurgents. Hence, barriers to entry in mob-controlled industries are high. Indeed, in Coppola's 175-minute film, there's barely a suggestion that a new family could come to compete with the five, let alone that an organization other than a family could try to enter. (There is one suggestion than an existing deputy of one of the families could do a start-up.)Relatedly, the specter of boycotting by the Corleone family is ever-present. The Godfather's office is the marketplace. Demand walks in, and the Godfather farms it out to approved suppliers of murder, maiming, extortion, etc. Hence the refrain from his lieutenants, \"Who(m) should I give this job to?\" As an antitrust defendant, Don Corleone would likely argue that this matching of buyers to sellers is a market-promoting service, see Chi. Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231 (1918)\u2014like a market maker on a securities exchange\u2014while prosecutors would allege that, by unilaterally choosing the supplier for each transaction, he is impeding an open market rather than lubricating it. Prosecutors would background this argument with atmospherics of racial discrimination, cf. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982), by the Corleones qua employer; Mike says of the family attorney, \"He's a good lawyer (but n)ot a Sicilian one.\"Market-splitting is rampant in The Godfather. One family controls the Bronx, another Brooklyn, and so on. In a particularly apt bit of dialog, during the epic meeting of the five families, one head refers to the United States as being split into \"territories.\" This meeting is the smoking gun of collusion amongst the five families. If they could survive evidentiary challenges, such gems as Don Corleone's \"When did I ever refuse an accommodation?\" would find prominent places in the prosecution's brief.The tying in Coppola's film is blatant enough to make Yale, Hack v. Yale Corp., 237 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2000), or Microsoft, United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam), blush. And the ties that bind are first and foremost family ties. Hence the brilliant opening sequence of intercutting between shadowy interiors of business deals and sun-washed exteriors of the wedding, which lingers long enough\u2014the latter replete with multi-generational singing, dancing and tribute-paying\u2014to make us feel we're there, part of the family. The mistake of the father whose beseeching of Don Corleone opens the film was to miss this lesson. By not investing in respect for the family upfront, by forgetting that the contract with the Godfather is a deep basket of goods and services that one locks into for the long term, he insults the CEO. Only by signing up for the whole kit and caboodle\u2014including reciprocity of a sort and at a time to be named later\u2014does he get into the club. Hence the plausibility of Mike's claim at the end of the film that he is imposing exile\u2014the ultimate punishment by the market dominator\u2014on his brother-in-law. Sonny's career as family head is doomed not just because he's a hothead but also because he forgets that ultimately it's all about family.All these shenanigans are ways of restraining trade. And how better to restrain trade than decapitate the $600,000 horse of a Hollywood producer who won't hire your guy and leave the head in his bed, to whack a Las Vegas developer who won't sell you his hotel, or to execute your competitors point blank under the mantle of family ties? While making offers that one figuratively can't refuse is generally market-promoting, making offers than one literally \"can't refuse\" is market-restricting.So, would going after mob commerce under the antitrust laws be an unprecedented prosecution of a monopoly that the government itself sponsored? Nope. The government unwittingly sponsors monopolists all the time, by imposing so much regulation that potential entrants don't bother. Thus the Godfather is referring to America's political organs when he says, \"I believe in America. America's made my fortune.\" And he is speaking on behalf of countless regulatorily entrenched incumbents\u2014from banks to taxis, Katrina Miriam Wyman, Problematic Private Property: The Case of New York Taxicab Medallions, 30 Yale J. on Reg. 125 (2013)\u2014too.", "Best Movie!": "The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.\"The Godfather\" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although \"The Godfather\" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of \"The Godfather\" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so \"The Godfather\" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel.

The plot is gripping, an amazing interpretation of the American Mafia, and the film's acting is superb. The characters make the film seem like we are watching a documentary moreso than a movie. You can see the transformation of Michael from the reluctant son, to the man who inherits an empire. Al Pacino's performance is outstanding. Marlon Brando is such a believable godfather that I think mafiosos throughout history would feel intimidated if they ever had to go to a \"meeting\" with Don Corleone.James Caan also provides a smashing performance as the hot-headed Sonny. His ferocity and high spirited attitude adds so much to the film. I've always wondered if Robert Duvall's natural speaking voice is that of Tom Hagan or of another one of his characters like the preacher or Gus.This is one of the few films that I will never, ever grow tired of watching. Dramatically and cinematically speaking, it is one of the few films that I admire and wish that other Hollywood directors and producers would try to emulate as far as style, story development and acting goes, especially in Hollywood's dark time of remakes and lackluster script writing.", "One of the Best Mob Movies of all time!": "The Godfather is definitely a masterpiece in every sense of the word.

Michael kills the people kills the people planning to get in their way, and then heads off to Sicily to hide. While he is gone, the family goes horrible downhill as the empire falls in a post-World War II during the 1940's. The best thing about the movie is that it is so interesting seeing the Mafia up close. It is so smart and brilliantly made by director Francis Ford Coppola. Wonderful acting by Brando, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall. Great film-editing and some of the best characters ever made in Hollywood. An excellent achievement.

OK, so it has some nice music, decent acting, and a gripping plot. All in all, I'm secure enough to state that it is an OK movie. However, the fact that it is rated 9.2 out of 10, and on #2 spot in the top IMDb movie list requires some analysis. Deep analysis on this simple question: is this movie really better than the 100,000 or so other movies in IMDb? Better yet, is there something wrong with humanity if a movie about sick, violent, greedy, vengeful, hateful people gets a #2 spot? My answer to this last question is, sadly, yes. Well, at least for the bulk of humanity: individually, there is no problem to rate this movie 10/10 (in fact, there is but hey, I'm putting it into perspective here), because it is fairly entertaining. But the fact that statistically it has been rated so high shows you about the sad and devious nature of people. I, for one, have rated at least 200 movies higher than The Godfather, and I am proud of it, because I cannot convince myself that a film which tells you the story of people with the lowest possible moral can be one of the best I've seen. Main characters have to have at least a very small ray of humanity and decency in them for the movie to be really good (character depth), or else, it is just an average action movie, nothing more...8/10", "Is getting better each year": "The godfather.\nWhere do I have to start?\nMarlon brando or Al Pacino\n187 minutes of intense waiting just for (what is the next move?)\nIt's like a game of chess when you have Protect the king ( the family) and to do that you have to move your pawn ( Michael) but on the way to win you have to sacrifice both of your queen ( veto corolonge) and knghts ( santino and tom ) to let your pawn flourish on the mat as a new queen controlling the whole board\n10/10 is not enough for this kind of films", "Drab and awful?": "Derirative, contrived, moronic in parts, inexcusably slapstick, horrendously acted, monstrously ill-informed, soul-wastingly aimless, incompetantly structured, amazingly awful dialogue, virulently hideous casting, monstrous over use of toilet humour, inescapably stupid bodily function gags, insanely complicated plot, innumerable plot-holes, a myriad of anachronisms, baffling directorial ineptitude, spectacularly pretentious and alienating, superbly bad costumes, terrible make-up, manically dire soundtrack... ...are all NOT faults of this quite splendid gangster epic.

It's considered by almost all to be a three hour masterpiece. But, there's my first problem. It's three hours. Not that I despise movies that run for this long, because some certainly do have the content to keep that run time entertaining. This one, however, gets boring and slow at times. When I say this, I am mostly referring to the Marlon Brando dialogue scenes. I cannot get over the way the words fall out of his mouth as he mumbles them. Why he did his dialogue like this, I have no idea. If there was a reason for it, I stand by my rating. Don't get me wrong, this movie was anchored by great performances and writing, directing and cinematography, but it did not require three hours to be told.

They didn't even agreed with some of the shot and artistic vision he had for his film but and went on to do amazing things, breaking records ad setting new ones. It did great in the box office that year and it went on to become the greatest film of all time. Not only did the film inspired filmmakers like my self but it paved the way for Mafia films in general. Ironically Francis him self became in his own right a godfather in the world of Mafia film. I also enjoyed watching how the characters in the film changed towards the ending of the film.

The film communicates many different things on many different levels to the audience.  First and foremost is the importance of family.  The Don has never made any apologies for the life that he leads and did it all for the sake of his family.  It is true that there is no honor among thieves but this is a movie.  For the mere sake of the story, Don Vito Corleone is an honorable man.  His word is bond and he is not a selfish cheat.  Don Vito Corleone's most appealing asset is his relationship with his family.  Although the film starts with Don Vito Corleone's reign as Godfather, the film is focused on the reign of Michael. There are things that I learned in this film and the other two films that I carry with me today.  `Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer' is just one of the things that I think are important from that film.  `Never hate your enemies for it clogs your judgment' is another.The film shows that even the best made plans can go off course.  Don Vito never planned that life for Michael.  Without telling too much of the picture I can say once again it is the greatest film that I have ever seen and I have seen a great number.  Gone with the Wind is an epic and as all time period pieces go, it does make us think about when times were different.  I never could relate to GWTW.  Living in Atlanta it is forced upon you but still does not quite cut it.  It is much different than Star Wars because it appeals to a more earthly and realistic side of movies. Sci-Fi is a favorite of mine but this does not compare.  Good overtakes evil in the Star Wars saga and in the Godfather films we are always cheering on the bad guys.  They pay for their sins in triplicate, but still they would never change the lives that they lead.Finally, the film is ageless.  I still get the same rush from the movie that I did when I was first old enough to comprehend the true dynamics of the story so many years ago.  We will always have corruption, murder, and power brokering in the underworld and it will in many cases be intertwined with certain political figures.  Another thing that will remain a constant is the love for family and the undying care a father has for his children.  A father will give the lesson, may it be right or wrong by other's standards, this is who we are, this is what we do, and this is how we do it.The Godfather will reveal the many different things in the family, but most of all...it is about a father , his sons, and their business.Francis Ford Coppola did a wonderful job bringing that story to the people.DHM", "!!!!!!THE BEST!!!!!!": "Well, to say something about this movie is rather easy because you know that every single serious movie-goer would agree that this is one (I would say THE ONE) of the best movies ever made in heaven or hell.

Because this is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE and I want to make that clear...  :)", "Perhaps the best film on organized crime made in this century.": "THE GODFATHER undoubtedly remains a masterpiece in motion picture production and is probably on the top ten list of best films ever made of most movie buffs.  Based on Mario Puzo's highly acclaimed novel of a fictional Sicilian American crime family, it is a dramatic and realistic portrayal of the trials and tribulations of life, liberty, and justice in the \"underworld\". This film introduced moviegoers to the acting genius of Al Pacino and reemphasized the unique talents of Marlon Brando, which won him an Oscar in his splendid portrayal on Don Vito Corleone, the founder and titular head of a powerful mafia family.

Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]\u2014and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990. On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his fear, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he \"sleeps with the fishes\". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital, but is accosted by corrupt police captain McCluskey, who breaks his jaw; Sonny retaliates by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey that his brother approves over Hagen's objections: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael lures the pair to a restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Vito, saddened to learn that, despite his hopes, Michael has become involved in the family business, decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home and over a year later marries Kay. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife to make the business legitimate within five years. He allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises even as he plans to move family operations to Nevada and delegates New York business to members who stay behind. Hagen, upset when Michael replaces him with Vito, is mollified by the older man's reassurance about their long- range plans for him. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signally his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Brazen, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone.", "The Struggle of One Man": "If you haven't seen this movie, then you're missing a part of American history.

Personally, I always feel that the longer a movie is the, the better, as it leaves more room for character and plot devolpment, but even in the best of the 170+ minute movies I've seen, there's always a few scenes that you feel could've been cut short or cut altogether. That never happens in The Godfather.The characters, particularly Vito Corleone (Brando) and Michael Corleone (Pacino), are so dynamic and have such rich backgrounds; this is the key to a good story, IMO. The dialogue is classic, as you'll no doubt recognize many of the lines and expressions that have been incorporated into our modern vernacular.There's so much more I wish to say about this movie, but I believe I'm running short on space. I'm a young man who doesn't always agree with critics and older audiences as to which films are truly classic. I've never been swayed to like a movie because others say it's great. So the fact that a 34-year old movie still has this kind of appeal to a younger audience is quite telling. I strongly encourage anyone of any age to see this movie. This is the pinnacle of American cinema.", "An Amazing Film": "The Godfather is probably the most well crafted film ever made. No true fan of film will deny this piece of art. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino turn in amazing performances. James Caan and Robert Duvall are equally brilliant. The cinematography is among the best I've seen and the lighting is nearly perfect.Watch this movie. Then watch it again.", "The Godfather, a review": "Hailed by almost every film critic as a masterpiece this film is regularly voted as #1 in film polls, or at very least in the top 10. And if there was ever a movie which deserved it's place amongst the elite, this is it. Director Francis Ford Coppola had only made low-budget movies and enjoyed limited success as a director up until 1970 when he came to recognition with his screenplay for Patton. The screenplay won him\u0097and co-writer Edmund H. North\u0097 an Oscar. He then began work on a screenplay for The Godfather with Mario Puzo, the book's author. The resulting film took the world by storm and won Coppola his second Oscar for writing. The film also won Best Picture and Best Actor (Marlon Brando) at the 1973 Academy Awards and was nominated for 8 others Oscars including three nominations for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall).The wealth of acting talent in the leading roles is unparalleled. Marlon Brando's Don has been copied and imitated in countless films and TV shows since it's release; the strength and memorable nature of his performance standing as a true testament to his acting ability. Al Pacino gives a career best performance as Michael, struggling to remain aloof of his family's criminal activities and maintain a happy relationship with his girlfriend Kay (played brilliantly by Diane Keaton) but eventually being dragged into the family 'business' by his father's failed assassination attempt. James Caan is superb as the hot-headed older Corleone brother, Sonny; subsequent acting roles have never quite given him the opportunity to shine as he does here. Robert Duvall's cool, calm and collected adopted brother character, Tom, is a marvellous addition to the family as he tries to diffuse situations with sensible advice (he is the family's lawyer and consigliore). However he too appears to have hidden, darker tendencies; the famous horse's head scene is apparently all his own doing. The whole Corleone family is played with perfect depth and emotion by all the actors; John Cazale as Fredo is the perfect example of the understated performance\u0097he is not as prominent as Sonny, Michael and Tom but still an integral player and extremely memorable. The only aspect of the acting which seems to be less than perfect is the supporting actors in the smaller roles. Although there is nothing 'wrong' with their performances, one does feel at times that they are stereotypes i.e. the rotund chef / hit-man Clemenza, and the aging henchman still trying to break out into his own 'family' (Tessio).This is without a doubt the most influential movie of the 1970s and whatever minor quibbles might exist about some of the stereotyping, the acting of the leading stars, the perfect direction and brilliant musical score (by Coppola's father, Carmine) cannot be faulted. The pacing and editing of The Godfather must also be commended because even with a runtime of almost three hours, it never feels boring and withstands repeated viewing. A true American classic, it spawned two sequels; The Godfather Part II, which is also hailed as a masterpiece and won numerous Oscars, and the lesser but still noteworthy Part III. Currently residing at #1 on the IMDb's Top 250 list, this has been firmly lodged there for some time.", "Come on guys....keep it original": "I love everything about this movie, the acting, the imagery, the intrigue, the score...the only thing I have a problem with though is the title. Like can you really sleep at night? Like honestly REM sleep, knowing that you single-handedly stole the title of The Godfather from the demon of the north himself, Krampus. Adjacently, The Godfather 2? *Bleh* more like Jack I'm the Box Rises. Come up with something original next time, for God's sake.", "About the movie": "This movie is the best movie ever for me ! He deserve the first place ! Story : \"Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.\" -This short story said everything about this movie, i liked all the personality, specially the hero of the movie. The Director he had know how to play with all the personalities and their roles. So great thank to him because he make a great movie. For the stars, \"Unkonwn\" he's my best actor all time ! 14 October 1994 is a special day, so always remember it ! :D I liked everything about the movie, even the Soundtracks. I think in our day we missed the movies such as The Shawshank Redemption, and the good father .. :(", "A compelling crime-drama, the Godfather, will never cease to disappoint its audience, and remains a top contender within its genre.": "\"The Godfather\" is an American Crime film, which made its debut into theaters on March 24, 1972. The film was based on the original penned by Mario Puzo, with the same title. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film was centralized around the lives of an elite mob family in New York. Regarded as a classic, The Godfather has been an iconic American film, having been considered one of the greatest features in American films. It is a film that is multifaceted having evidence of several emerging underlying themes.The film commences with the wedding of mob leader, \"Don\" Vito Corelone's (Marlon Brando) daughter. Arriving as a decorated Marine, Corelone's son, Michael (Al Pacino) is in attendance to his sister's nuptials. Michael is adamant about his unwillingness to participate in his families' business of organized crime and is a decorated United States Marine returning from World War II. In the midst of the celebratory event, the Don has a private meeting with Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) whom requests a monetary commitment and protection to engage in a partnership within the emerging drug trade. Pursuant the investigation of a spy, it is unearthed that that Sollozzo was involved with Correlonne rivals, the Tattaglias. The denial of the opportunity sparked a fire fight between the two clans; resulting in a failed assassination of the Don. This ordeal prompted Michael, to pursue involvement within the family business. After a visitation with his father at the hospital exposed that the two hired men hired to defend the mob boss were unable to located leaving Vito vulnerable to additional attacks. During his recovery, Vito's eldest son and Michael's brother, \"Sonny\", portrayed by actor James Caan, assumes seniority and regains control of the family affairs. It was following this change-of-command that a string of mafia murders commenced.Continuation of the feuds between opposing families resulted in many casualties, including that of Sonny, was murdered en route to apprehend, brother-in-law Carlo, for brutally abusing his wife, and Vito's daughter Connie. While idling at a local toll-booth, a slue of heavily armed assassins relinquished gun fire succumbing Sunny to his demise. Away from the heart of the happenings, Michael meets romantic interest Appollonia (Simonetta Steffanelli) , in Sicily. The pair wed, however all is far from a fairy tale ending. The existence of the couple was short lived, as Appollonia was murdered in a vehicle by detonated car bombs that had been placed by assassins sent forth from the feuding families with an attempt to kill Michael.It is with these developments that you truly see the development of Michael's character.Shaped by experiences, plagued my unspoken heartbreak by losing loved ones, and embracing a life of crime which he formerly opposed. \"The Godfather,\" continues with plights of violence and opposition, as Michael assumes control of the mob's affairs. The move, has set high standards for the genre, as standards for forthcoming films will be comparable to this favorite film. Other movies represented in the same category are those are well-crafted, however, aren't comparable to the storyline and the character development that is presented within the Godfather Trilogy. Movies such as \"Reservoir Dogs,\" imitate the same violent antics that are exhibited in other mafia features, however,lack the same continuity that the Godfather possesses. As Michael is declared the new \"Don\", he seeks to relocate the business to Nevada to avenge his family, lovers, and friends. The film, is action packed with surprised lurking around every corner with unsuspecting twists that occur as a result of the gritty , unsuspecting life of a mobster. A compelling crime-drama, the Godfather, will never cease to disappoint its audience, and remains a top contender within its genre.", "A culpable masterpiece from the Master": "This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to a ruthless mafia boss.", "The Greatest Crime Syndicate": "the greatest crime show i have ever seen. The godfather is a tale about revenge, betrayal,love and hustle. On this hand, A powerful and rich family. An Organized crime empire passed down from father to son. On the other hand, Other ruthless powerful rival families. Special thanks to Al-Pacino and Robert De Niro. Some of the greatest Actors of our time.The motion picture (in view of a script labored over for quite a while by Puzo and afterward at last given frame, I think, by executive Francis Ford Coppola) gets a similar vibe. We have a tendency to relate to Don Corleone's family not on the grounds that we burrow group wars, but rather in light of the fact that we have been with them from the earliest starting point, watching them sit tight for the fight to come while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper containers. \"The Godfather\" himself is not even the focal character in the dramatization. That position goes to the most youthful, brightest child, Michael, who comprehends the way of his dad's position while modifying his antiquated ways. The Godfather's part in the family endeavor is portrayed by his name; he remains outside the cutting edge which will continue and, ideally, point the family into genuine undertakings.", "An Epic!": "There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.Right movie from the beginning of the movie, the music is haunting. It pulls you towards itself, like the fatal attraction of parvana to the shama. Marlon Brando is characteristic. There has never been another Don in history so charming, honorable and one who is also a true family man. A Don who respects his friends and never forgets a favor.The transformation of Al Pacino from the distant lad who says \"That's my father, Kate, not me\" to the emotional son beside his father in the hospital ensuring him \"I am with you now\" to ultimately the unprecedented words pronounced by him \"I am working for my father now\" underlines the storyline.Some of my favorite dialogues by the movie are: \"A man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man.\" \"I never ask for a second favor when I have been refused the first.\" \"Don't tell me you're innocent, because it exhausts my intelligence.\" \"Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family.\" \"Women and children can be careless but not men.\" The distress look on Brandon's face when he finds out his war hero son is invariably pulled into the underworld business, the silent tears of acknowledgement when he hears the news of his other son's murder and simply says \"I want no acts of vengeance\" shows that some actors don't need big dialogues to act.The final stages between father and son are beautifully portrayed. A concerned father advising his son, the last person he thought would be his successor. And the dutiful son consoling his dad that \"We'll get there\".The music is not just background score but also underlines the essence of the movie. Attentions to details like the steady flow of water, chirping of the birds, are hard to ignore.The climax of the movie where he lies with so much conviction to his beloved wife completes the transformation of Al from a civilian to the head of the Corleone family.", "123456789": "While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death.", "The Godfather of all the movies from the last 33 years!!!": "Very well executed, \"The Godfather\" is one of the best films of the last three decades. It is directed by a great director: Francis Ford Coppola, and the cast is so great: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton (in her first starring role).Winner of 3 Oscars and 5 Golden Globes, \"The Godfather\" is one of the best gangster flicks ever made. You do not remember the facts, but this film is a classic tale of a Mafia family: the Corleones. This is a true classic of the 1970s, you don't be fooled.I also recommend: \"The Godfather, Part II\" and \"The Godfather, Part III\". Rent the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy in your local videostore.", "Real Drama": "This is been excellent and favorite movie all the time. Mr. Francis done really a great in the history of cinematography. First opening scene has revealed the outstanding performance of Mr. Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was absolutely amazing in his young age. This movie set the dimension of a underworld trend setter movie.", "Acting is good but with 1 big problem.": "This Film is almost 3 hours long! I like the story, acting by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but after I watch this movie on my TV for 1 hour, I start to look at my phone. The spoiler in which Vito Corleone died is dramatic( Which is a good thing). But after I watch this movie, I have mixed feeling, whether I felt happy that Michael take over the Corleone family or should feel bad after for the past 2+ hours that some of the character died in the end. But still, good effort by the director himself. When I think that when critics and people think that this is the best film of all time, I have some doubts about it, maybe other films like the wizard of oz or Forrest Gump might be better.", "Best. Movie. Ever.": "I didn't know movies could be this perfect. The acting, the story line, and the cinematography are superb. How much more can I write?", "I think it makes sense in the movie": "Don't let anybody know what you are thinking . Great men are not born great . They grow great . Never hate your enemies . If affects your judgment . A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man . Behind every successful fortune , there is crime .", "An outstanding look at the mobster hierarchy": "Francis Ford Coppola manages to execute one of the finest pieces of American cinema with the first of his three part saga, The Godfather. From the dialogue to the acting, this film excels in painting a gritty, realistic depiction of the mobster hierarchy, with one of the greatest pieces of acting in cinematic history with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone. This film has already stood the test of time and is deservedly ranked as one of the greatest films of all time. A true masterpiece.I urge you if you have not yet checked out this film, what are you waiting for? It's a true hallmark of cinematic excellence and is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion.", "Great overall film": "This movie was well directed with great acting and character development. There were many plot twists that kept me guessing and made me want to sit through the lengthy film. Although, there were a few confusing jumps in time that took away from the overall experience of the film. This film set the mold of what many crime dramas would later follow.\nThe film had great cinematography, using appropriate colors for each scene's tone. The film's score also resonated well with the scenes it was played in. The actors did a great job of immersing themselves in post-war mob culture while maintaining good chemistry with their co-stars. In conclusion, The Godfather is a film with excellent cinematography, acting, music, and plot.", "Overrated In Nutshell": "When a director tries to romanticize what shouldn't romanticized such like mob crimes, prostitution laundry money works, Drugs dealing.. all this goofy stuff to present an evil version of robin hood who tries to justify a weak folks,protect his family and Pushing you in the same uncomfortable corner that your boring philosophy professor about morality , hence that fake masterpiece is the result.So, is The Godfather an Overrated film?!WTF, no! It is super-overrated and boring.I had really high expectations about this movie, like \"Hey, you just must see it - that's how the world really works!\". As a journalist, I could not miss such a masterpiece. Well...the things did not work out as I had expected. First of all, in general, I found it to be way too long, boring and tedious. I get why so many people are impressed with that movie, it offers some interesting ideas to consider, some - well-hidden, though - criticism of the American society between the lines and a fascinating storyline.I really liked some scenes and parts, for example, \"Michael-hiding-himself-in-Italy\" was really beautiful! However, most of the movie is filled up with serious guys seriously discussing serious issues with a serious accent. And that's it! There is almost no humour, no symbology, no moral, no emotional charge - and no entertainment. By the way, I had exactly the same impression from the book and, knowing the plot already, I could not make myself to finish it.Second, the acting and the characters. I expected something really super-amazing, or at least believable and accurate, and found none of those. I am a big fan of Al Pacino, for example, he totally nailed it in the Devil's Advocate (a better movie than the GF, in my opinion) but here, his stony face is just too...stony. No sensual or emotional charge at all. Just a serious, decisive guy - and nothing more. Hard to trust or to believe. The same for Marlon Brando. The GF is the only movie with him I have seen so far but his wheezy voice makes me cringe. And these guys are supposed to be Italians? They look like they both have had a serious deal of a serious wheat.And, the last but not the least - the accuracy. There is none. First of all, it is really...hard to believe that an Italian family, first and second generation of immigrants, speaks English with a weird accent all the time. This is just crazy and I am surprised no one mentions this epic fallacy. For God's sake, they should speak Italian at least for the purpose of conspiracy, as they do all they can to hide their activities from the state!Second, there are almost no pictures of what the Corleones' circus is actually doing for living. We see a rich house, family dinners, rituals, consiglieris but no murders, no drugs, no prostitution, no dirty stuff, except for a couple of shots. It's an unfair presentation. There is no sense in asking whether the portrayal of the organized crime in the movie is accurate since the picture is incomplete.Pues...to sum up, in my opinion, it's a tedious, commercial and super-superficial movie which is not bad in the common sense of these words - it might be worth seeing once. However, a fairly overrated one. The best movie of all times? No way. There are many deeper, funnier and more consistent pieces around.In my view, a movie is great if it engages the imagination, captivates, makes one think more expansively, and above all ENTERTAINS. The Godfather does all of these, but not really to any remarkable degree. I can think of twenty other movies that outdo The Godfather in all of those categories.Another thing: I prefer movies that tell an engaging story, and the focus of that story is about BIG IDEAS. The Godfather is one of those movies that are about people and the characters. The latter really is of little interest to people with more analytical, logical-thinking minds, and more appealing to \"feeler\" type people who get fascinated by people-focused stories and relationships.That's it.", "A Classic": "You can not have seen this movie its such a classic.", "like new every time": "Glowing reviews are pretty much universal for The Godfather, and nothing I can say here could even significantly ad to the mountain of (well deserved)acclaim given to this masterpiece.  The acting is superb: Brando is breathes subtle grace into the title role, Pacino gives an epic performance, Caan would never be this good again, nor would Talia Shire, Cassavettes is unflinching, and the constant analysis of every angle running behind the eyes of Robert Duval absolutely makes the film.  Coppola, as always, is given to the grandiose, but here it fits like the proverbial glove, and he guides smoothly from ultimate tension (the \"gun-in-the-toilet\" scene leaves me dry-mouthed in fear even after the umpteenth viewing)to ultimate calm. The score is by now a classic, but like the entirety of this work, never satisfies merely on the memory of what it WAS but always fresh with what it still is.  Overwhelming every time.", "The best movie made ever": "This is the best film made ever. To learn and to understand how to make good movies The Godfather is the best movie ever that nobody filmed until now except Coppola. A perfect cinematic scenes, locations, art designs, wardrobe, plot, role acting, direction, art department, script, etc. This film has all the ingredients to know how to make a brilliant good film. Unfortunately knowing all of these parts too many people adding structural parts of the movies and making with all these ingredients didn't make a movie as Francis Ford Coppola made.", "Just an Overrated Movie.": "This movie don't deserve to be watched .\nThe movie is very slow.", "Truly the Greatest": "This is probably my favourite movie. It really is tough to decide between the first 2 for the greatest, but i do think that this just has a slight edge, and i am also a huge fan of the 3rd, but its not quite in the same league. I just think that it's really mindblowing how awesome Marlon Brando is in this movie. That is probably the most deserved Best Actor Award ever, as this movie is probably the greatest Best Picture winner ever.Basically this movie is about organised crime, or the mafia, or cosa nostra or whatever you want to call it. I can see how some may think that it glorifies the world of organised crime, but i really don't think that that makes any difference at all. A really basic overview of the story is that Michael Corleone (Al Pacino in one of his greatest roles ever, alongside the other Godfather movies and Scarface) is involuntarily drawn into the world of organised crime when his father, Vito \"The Don/The Godfather\" Corleone (Marlon Brando) gets gunned down in the street. Of course there are a thousand small loops involved, like the whole Sonny, Connie and Carlo triangle and Tom Hagen (beautifully portrayed by Robert Duvall) is important as well.I don't think i could ever get over this movie, as it is one of the most brilliant things i have ever seen.", "The story of Corleone family": "I'm not going to waste my time and my words on the plot or the summary of the film, but I'll write about the feelings that I proved watching \"the Godfather\". This film is a perfect movie and the cast is one of the best ever seen: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire... The majority of the actors are still appreciated and sought-after. The cinematography is wonderful; the soundtrack is very good (when I hear the trumpet at the real beginning I have the creep). I was really surprised when I read that \"the Godfather\" won only three Academy Awards: it should have won at least 10 of them. \"The Godfather\" is one of of the films that will be remembered even many years by now, and it's without doubts one of my favourite movies (with \"the Godfather - part II and part III\" and \"Braveheart\"). Don't miss it!", "A real man": "When I saw this movie ten years ago, I couldn't understand it.And now I think it's the best movie I ever seen. Marlon Brando is the real man.", "Sets the bar in terms of quality - for any film ever made.": "The Godfather is not a film for everyone, you need patience, understanding, and appreciation for pure cinema.And pure cinema is exactly what you get. This masterpiece of acting, directing, storytelling, is so deep and meaningful, you may need several viewings to truly get the beautiful cinematic picture that this film paints, I did.If you have doubts about the films greatness, give it a chance, watch the whole thing at once, immerse yourself in the experience.The way all the characters interact and flow is so realistic, Al Pacino did an outstanding job in particular and is widely regarded as the greatest actor of all time, and for good reason.This film will undoubtedly stand the test of time, and I would be very surprised if something came along to out-do this 1972 classic.I'm not sure if Francis Ford Coppola knew what a piece of magical film making he was gifting to the world.", "Just wow!!": "Never thought I could enjoy a movie so much. Not into crime drama this just took my breath away!! A true masterpiece. That's what acting is all about. I wonder why I never got into it earlier.", "The Gother Father Review": "The Godfather The film The Godfather takes place in New York and some parts of Italy during the mob era in the late 1930's and '40's. The story begins with a mob boss Don Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather, who conducts \"business\" out of his office. The scenes that take place here are where most plots and deals are being prepared. Usually trouble is being made when scenes take place here. Corleone is asked by a New York gangster, Sollozzo, for protection in exchange for profit from the drug trafficking business. Advised by his adopted son and family lawyer, Tom Hagen, and since he is not fond of drugs, Corleone decides to decline Sollozzo's offer. Following an assassination attempt on Corleone conducted by Sollozzo, his oldest son Sonny takes over the family business. Soon after this assignment to power, Sonny is assassinated. The next in line is Corleone's youngest son, Michael, the main character, who is a World War II hero. Michael had vowed to never become part of the family business but is slowly falling into the position due to his brother's death. After he is involved in a mob killing, Michael is forced to move to Sicily, where his father was born, until everything calms down. A movement that is frequently seen throughout the film is hand gestures. These are usually made as a signal for help, to kill someone or used to get a point across. An object that is seen often during the film is a gun. The gun represents quick resolution and necessity for survival.Although this film is a classic, it isn't well written because the scenes were scattered. It was also hard to follow and I had to watch it twice in order to understand what was happening. In addition, it was very lengthy. It seemed like there pointless scenes in the film.In The Godfather the viewer is able to see the different groups of people throughout the movie. One of the main groups in the movie is Don Corleone and his sons. Another group is the heads of the five families. These men would meet during movie to negotiate money, territory and other things that involve mob concerns. A different group in the film is the rest of the family. These people are important because the mobsters cherish, protect and believe family comes first against anything.In the film little things are the cause of big things. For instance, when Don Corleone decided to decline from Sollozzo's offer, the consequence was the hit that Sollozzo put on him. Another example is when Sonny's sister was beat by her husband Sonny decides to go after him but ends up trapped at the toll booth where he was assassinated. A similar example is after Sonny is killed, Michael becomes head of the family business. All films are uncanny. The Godfather is my MLK film, therefore it is uncanny.From the film I learned that even though you are in a \"family\" business you still are not able to trust anyone fully. The message of this movie is that when conducting a business there is always someone out to get you. Especially when you are at the top you have to watch your surroundings and who you decide to trust because once you at the top the only direction you can go is downward.", "The greatest landmark on American cinema.": "The Godfather is great. For almost thirty years now audiences have been captivated and intrigued by the Corleone family. And no other mafia movie has ever come as close to being this good. The story is just amazing and the directing by Francis Ford Coppola is nothing less than spectacular. Coppola has taken the concept of organized crime in America, something that was once looked down upon, and has built a cult following around it, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as their leading figures. And I don't think any single film has produced as many memorable scenes as The Godfather. Who could ever forget Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, buying those oranges on that fateful day? Or James Caan, as Sonny Corleone, getting massacred by the barrage of machine-gun bullets? And lines that will forever be repeated by fans like, \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" The bottom line is that The Godfather has changed the way we look and judge films. It has made cool what is sinful, crime a family value, and dynamic characters the modern-day icons of several generations of storytelling in film. Alongside all the revolutionary pictures of all time, The Godfather earns it place at the very top. Whether it is the #3 greatest film by the American Film Institute, #1 by IMDb, or #2 by me, this movie should very well be agreed by all to be a landmark in American film history.", "A movie I can't refuse!": "The best movie of all time. It is the great beginning of the greatest film trilogy of all time. Truly mesmerizing with it's epic directing and stellar cast. It is definitely Hollywood (actually film-making as a whole) at its best. Loved the scenes and the atmosphere. It really deserves all the love it gets.", "Doesn't deserve to be # 1": "I liked this film and all, but does anyone really think this film is better than Lord of the Rings? Come on! It's surprising how many people supposedly \"love\" this film, yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted. A few mumblings here and there do not good acting make. And the attention to detail argument? \"It's so detailed - exactly as that era!\" So what? Lord of the Rings brought to life a FANTASY land, far more challenging than 1940's New York.", "Pure movie magic": "I watched it a few years ago and I didn't like it, I thought it was \"cool\" but nothing else. I thought it was boring and slow.I then watched it a few years later, I recommend to watch it in the day or when your not tired, it is sooooo good!!!!!! I agree it's the best film of all time, shawshank coming very close. It may not be my favourite, but I agree it is the best. I prefer watching number 2, but number 1 is amazing.", "What else can be said?": "What else can be said about this cinematic masterpiece that has not been said a million times?  What exactly is it about this movie that ranks it the #1 movie of all-time on many lists, including imdb.com's list?  It isn't just the plot.  While masterful, I have seen better plots before.  Not many, of course, and not better by much, but there still are a couple.  It's not just the acting.  Again, I am hard pressed to think of better performances, but there are a few out there.  I will say that Brando's acting, Pacino's, Caan's, Duvall's, Keaton's, and so many others all mixed together were awesome.  But it's not only the way each one acts, but also the way each one acts off the others.  But still, the acting alone could not make this movie #1.  The cinematography, the lighting, the sound, the musical score, all these were terrific, but none of them made this movie.  So then, what DOES make this movie what it is?  I would say that it is taking all of these elements together and breathing life into them.  Rather than simply being a voyeur, watching all the action from the outside, the viewer is thrust into the middle of it.  He becomes surrounded by the action and to a certain extent becomes part of the Corleone family.  And as the movie races towards its climax, the viewer is pulled emotionally at every turn, forcing hatred towards good people, love towards evil people, respect for those who do not deserve it, and ultimately a great deal of sympathy for a man who rules with an iron fist and seems to be too concerned with his own well-being to care about the feelings of anyone else.  And yet, at the same time, we see that he does care, and he does feel, and he does love.  There is a tremendous feeling of family in this movie, a great sense of belonging.  And I believe that is the secret to this movie.  The viewer is not left on the outside, but brought inside warmly to share the innermost thoughts and feelings of men he might normally avoid and fear.  And the viewer learns a profound secret by watching this movie: There is no greater desire than the desire to belong, to be a part of something, no matter what that something may be; and this desire will be ultimately fulfilled no matter how much it is ignored or resisted.  Underneath it all, we are all the same.", "Simply the Best": "This is probably the best movie ever made, well certainly the best that I have seen. One of the few movies that I find loses nothing in comparison to the book. Why can't they make more movies like this anymore? The acting is superb, the sets are great, the pace of the story is well set out, and the soundtrack is so right for the film.Full marks to all who had anything to do with this creation.", "A near-perfect film.": "Believe me, for those don't have attention spans, this is a movie that is worth trying to overcome that shortcoming.  You won't be disappointed.  I was lucky enough to see this recently at the new American Film Institute's Silver Theatre and Cultural Center where I work.  Amazing.  The DVD set has some great extra features.  Also, look for the \"ghostly figure\" of Coppola during the funeral scene.  *****/*****", "Godfather startup!": "The Godfather movie has been reviewed from different perspectives and maybe this work of art is considered one of the masterpieces of cinema, but what has attracted my attention is the Godfather's business! An attractive idea with a business plan and a unique operational plan to create wealth and provide business security in innovative and new ways so that it can be inspired as a unique model for business development, how to manage members The group, keeping trade secrets, market development, audience analysis and how to deal with the law and interacting with society are only part of these issues that can be carefully considered, so I suggest you watch this movie from this angle.Mohammad jafar.", "Certainly overrated but still a great film": "This film is often regarded as perfect including the acting which is renowned as some of the best in the history of cinema. However I was quite underwhelmed by the performances except for Marlon Brando who is truly captivating whenever he is on screen (which is surprisingly not that often considering he won best LEAD actor for his performance.) Even Al Pacino's performance is both emotionless and forgettable in my opinion. I'm not going to waste time talking about everything that makes this film good because everyone has done that. What I am going to do is just mention some of the reasons why, overall, I was disappointed in the film. My first problem with the film is that I often found the story stretched thin by too many characters and occasionally found myself confused by the many unfamiliar Italian names that kept popping up. The first two hours of the film are exceptionally entertaining, well made and expertly written. However it is around the two hour mark where what was making the story so captivating is almost completely resolved and we are then forced to sit through another hour of a film that is no longer all that interesting. The three hour run time of the film is certainly unnecessary as even though seeing Michael take over the reigns of the family and watching Vito die is still great stuff it feels like it could have been covered in 15 minutes instead of adding another hour to a film that felt like it had already ended. I do understand that my opinion will not be popular but I felt that I should mention my problems with the film and stop some people being brainwashed by its 9.2 IMDb rating and then instantly saying that its a masterpiece so they could be accepted even though they may have found parts of it boring. I don't know... Perhaps my expectations were too high.", "masterpiece??? really???": "I read all kinds of reviews that call this flick a 'masterpiece'. What kind of masterpiece? I have never seen a masterpiece played on TV every single weekend.\nIt is always the B movies that are shown that much.\nAnd I love how 1 hour and 5 minutes of commercials are added on to make this a 4 hour movie. Repeat; a 4 hour movie!?!\nNo, it's not a masterpiece and if it was, it would still not get 4 straight hours of my time.", "Unfortunately, this movie is perfect!": "The only defect of this movie is that it is perfect. The fact is that there's nothing more irritating in a movie than the unanimity. When someone hears that a movie is perfect, the best of history, etc... he/her creates expectations so high that no movie can ever fulfil. This movie is the case. Every single detail is crafted to perfection. Mario Puzo gave it the tense and realistic plot. Coppola gave it the dignity. Brando gave it the genius. Nino Rota gave it the passion...Well, if you didn't see this movie, you are a very lucky person. You have the privilege of being able to see it for the first time and no experience can be stronger than the first one. But, first of all, forget all opinions about this movie. Don't create any expectation. Forget even this comment. And don't thank me for it. Just love \"The Godfather\".", "Once is never enough!": "Last Thanksgiving the WHOLE family was sitting at the table, eating, drinking.  My cousin shouted in from the living room, \"The Godfather's on,\" and it was, on regular TV complete with edits and commercials.  Anyway, it's safe to say that every person in that house that day saw The Godfather a hundred times and the comments were, \"My God, I've seen that so many times...\"  and within ten minutes everyone was in the living room, holding dishes in their hand, eating standing up, watching this movie that everyone knew inside out, everyone quoting from the movie as the actor's spoke, and so on.  Trivia facts shared, general info on the movie, and EVERYONE glued to the picture.   THAT is the sign of a great movie.  If a movie can hold this kind of hypnotic magic, even  after all these years, it has succeeded in the art of story-telling.  Perhaps no other movie has this attraction like Godfather I.  So, don't feel silly if you are seeing this movie for the tenth time (Or the hundredth time).  It's always a winner.", "GREATEST MOTION PICTURE EVER AND OF YEARS TO COME!": "The Godfather is without a doubt the Greatest Movie of our time and of anybody else's time. The brutally brilliant and passionate film is about the violent Mafia family, the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (Best Actor Academy Award Winner Marlon Brando) is passing on the family business to one of his sons-but which one? He decides to skip over the oldest son, the hotheaded Santino (Academy Award Nominee James Caan); He also decides to skip over cowardly Frederico (John Cazale); In the end he passes it down to youngest son, the intelligent Michael (Academy Award Nominee Al Pacino). This movie won the Academy Award for best picture in 1972 and deservedly so. Great performances by Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall. It deserves to be the IMDB's highest rated film and #3 on the American Film Institute's Best List. It should be number 1. On a scale of one to ten, this gets a 100.", "Not what I taught": "Couldn't stay awake after 3rd time trying to watch it", "Perhaps the best film ever made is an under statement": "Perhaps the best film ever made is an under statement.....A very powerful film that has three elements I look for the most, story, acting, and directing. One of Francis Fold Coppola's masterpieces (The God Father Part II, And Apocalypse now would be the other three)Marlo Brando perhaps give's his most famous, and best, performance as Vito Corelone. Good acting from Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall in my second favorite performances of his.I wold go into details of the story, but by now, most people should know what the story is therefore I won't. It is kind of surprising it only one three awards the year it came out. Granted the three were big ones (Screenplay, Best Actor, Picture).... I haven't seen Cabaret (the movie that picked up best director) So I can't judge if Fosse deserved it more than Coppola, but that's okay, Coppola got his just award the sequel (Which is an excellent flim and contender for best movie of all time as well)One thing that really sticks with me though in the movie, is the music, I always find myself humming the themes to The Godfather more than I do anything else, and I quote the movie just as much as I do Dr. Strangelove and Monty Python (With Python being home to most of my quotes)Rating: 10 out 10", "I'll give him an offer he can't refuse": "These words can be heard throughout this movie. So with it can other lines that people love to quote. I guess you could say I love this movie for the way it was written. For that I would say you might as well be right. I mean this is a great film that has been said to be the \"greatest film\" ever made. I don't really know if I can support that. It has been a \"great drama\" but that is just that there are other genres out there you know. One should also be advised that it is four hours long. Given in this day and age who has four hours to sit down and watch a great film much anymore? You know also there was alot of killing and intent to injure others in this film which might make you wonder about today. If i s alright to have in movies but not alright to have in real life? For the love of the great man upstairs its not a kids movie either. It might as well be a movie that you go see after reading the books. Thats right theere is a series of books! I never knew that until I looked on here and saw who wrote the screenplay. May you rest in piece Mr. Puzo you will not be forgotten! Please watch this film give it a chance and remember this, there are books!", "The only film that I gave note 10, and without a doubt it really is a masterpiece. I do not think will ever be matched by another film.": "A great film ... storyline, frameworks, so complex characters, the actors enter the characters so well in their ... undoubtedly a film that deserves a place of honor in the collection of films each ... If you saw the movie, try and book of the same title by Mario Puzzo ... simply help visual memory to \"see\" the characters ... the book is very good and worth reading after you see the movie. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie. In the second part of the movie was pretty broken thread by death character Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino seemed too young for the part.", "The Godfather is the ALLTIME BEST MOVIE IN MY LIFETIME!!!!!!!": "Spoilers!!!!The movies are just as rich in dialogue and plot as the books themselves. It is a compelling saga about the rise of the mobster Corleone family. You have to watch it several times before you understand the depth and magnitude of the storytelling. Marlon Brando was hailed for his acting in this film, I thought Al Pacino who plays the conflicted son of the patriarch had far more facets and nuances. I watched Godfather 2 and then 1 back to back so forgive me if the reviews overlap it really is one continuing story. It starts with an Italian marriage of the daughter where Vito grants favors to the Sicilian communities and extracts favors in return, You cannot help but side with his character.He has a sordid seedy side with mobsters, organized crime and racketeering. And yet the audience empathizes with his strong love for his Italian family as well as his ties and loyalty to his even closer knit mobster family. We see the magnitude of the power of the Godfather when Tom Hagen, the adopted son of the Godfather, an Irish Lawyer goes to Hollywood to send a message from the Godfather. He wanted his friend Johnny to have a plum role in an upcoming movie. The director shows off his beautiful mansion and $600,000 show horses. The director quickly becomes enraged at the request seeing that Johnny had stolen a starlet he was involved with and sends Tom on his way (Duvall). The next morning comes one of the most memorable scenes where he wakes up to the graphic bleeding horse head. The scene is powerful. Marlon Brando does some of his best acting in this piece it is best role of his lifetime which ultimately defines his acting for his generation as well as future generations to come. Every gesture is well thought and planned. From the script comes lines that even now are still unforgettable and are still often quoted--\"I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse\". The best acting is not when someone shows a full range of emotion it is at its best during quiet solitude, you can see Don Vito pondering and thinking his next step. he is pained when he hears Michael probably his most beloved son had killed the police and was sent away to Sicily, Michael's fate is sealed. He had always wanted him to be of legitimate power being the smartest of all the children. The quiet garden scene is magnificent as you see Marlon Brando conferring with Michael who is now getting entrenched in the family business and how the Godfather says he never wanted this for him. Deep down, Don Vito just wanted to make good for his family. Despite all the crime, he still loved his family and kept them close united in the family business. Vito was a bit of a Robin Hood, expelling bad people to help the good people which is why we emphasized with his character and rooted for him even with the evil entrapping. Even as he plotted revenge on the local Mafia boss in Sicily who gunned down his mother, father and brother we still cheer for him as he exacts his revenge. As his power declines, when Solozzo wanted to do narcotics and exact police coverage from the Godfather, even with promises of more wealth, Vito still had a code of ethics, that was to do no harm to children and not get involved with the sordidness of drugs. we can all relate to that. An attempt on his life is made and as we see the great Don fallen physically and literally from power and health, slowly the rise of the younger Corleones occur replacing the rapidly fading Don Vito Corleone. Another intense scene ensues when one of their hit men Luca Brazi is found dead, a package is delivered to their home with a bullet vest wrapping dead fish--an old Sicilian saying --he is sleeping with the fishes. A scene that has been multiplied and quoted a thousand times over in film and in media. The Godfather's usual body guard calls away sick that fateful day which does not go unnoticed. One day Clemenza, one of the Don's faithful accomplices since the start accompanies the body guard on a trip then tells him to stop while he takes a leak. The bodyguard is then shot. Clemenza nonchalantly tells the gunman \"leave the gun but take the cannolis\", another famous line. Alfredo, the middle son of Vito is incompetent and could not even pull the trigger on the gunmen who shot his father, he is outcast to managing casinos in Nevada being cared for by his younger brother Michael who he slowly resents. HIs is a portrayal of weakness in a family of dominant men. Sonny is the oldest brother who acts before he thinks steps in as the next Don. Micheal hears about his father's shooting as he and Kay (Diane Keaton) walk by a newsstand. He is hailed as a war hero and is the intelligent one who never got caught up in the family business. But with the shooting of his father he is inexorably pulled into the dark side. He visits his father and sees no staff or guards he moves his father to another room. Enzo, one who the Godfather has granted favors to comes to visit. Michael enlists his help to make like they have guns. He shows Enzo how to pretend his coat is loaded with a gun. When Solozzo's hitmen come by Michael makes a motion towards his coat as if he's about to pull out a gun and the mob car quickly scurries away. The cinematography is dramatic and magnificent. This scene was set at night. Michael hiding in the shadows and the shadowy figures of the hitmen are gripping telling the story of revenge, crime and evil. You see Enzo sjaking like aleaf knowing he could have nearly been gunned down. The police come by and the corrupt chief breaks Michael's jaw when he tells Michael to leave. Tom quickly comes by posing with private investigators, but the corrupt cop knows when to high tail it. This is the fateful night that Michael turns, you see a fine display of emotions on his face and he is compelled to do something to save his father which wins over his reticence in getting involved. You can practically see Michael's thoughts it is an all consuming role. Michael cannot deny his loyalty to his father despite his innocence. While Sonny and the main caporegimes are plotting, Michael pipes up he will take out the chief of the police and Solozzo. They are stunned It was unthinkable. They are astounded but impressed by Michael who is well known even among the 5 families of crime to be not involved. This marks his entry into depravity and darkness. They plan to use a respectable restaurant where the gun will be planted in advance in a bathroom, Clemenza reiterates 2 bullet to the head then drop the gun and walk. The plan goes without a hitch. Michael is banished to Sicily for a year where he falls in love with a beautiful but virtuous Italian girl. It is charming to see how women used to be courted before women's liberation and women are still virtuous. He courts her the old fashioned way slowly wins over the father and it is quite beautiful seeing the old world ways where she is chaperoned by 5 older women. You see the charming traditions of a Sicilian wedding set against a picturesque backdrop of old world villages and beautiful hills You feel like you are a part of the wedding party. He teaches her how to drive, but alas, one of his bodyguards plots to plant a bomb and his beautiful young wife gets caught in the crossfire. Michael goes home but does not seek Kay for another year. Kay is hurt but accepts him back and you wonder how a sweet innocent women can blend in with such a family ridden with crime. Connie, the only daughter of the Godfather, is wrapped up in her own drama. Her husband is a violent man.; She is often seen with bruises and black eyes. Sonny's temper is ultimately his downfall. He threatens Connie's husband if he should ever touch his sister again like that he would not see the living daylights. Connie's husband betrays the family and sets Sonny up by provoking a fight with Connie. Knowing Connie will be home he asks a mistress to call causing her to lose her temper followed by a glorious scene of dish smashing. It felt real as if you were in the room with them, what followed next was a very realistic scene of her husband taking his belt off and she runs to the bathroom with cries of terror, it was very uncomfortable to watch but you felt the raw emotion. Sonny hears about it and without an escort runs to Connie's defense and is assassinated in a brutal gun scene on the Long Island causeway, which is one of the most unforgettable scenes of the movie. Here you felt the backlash of crime and what befalls you when you get mixed up with it. Kay asks Michael if he would be the godfather to Connie's child. He consents but in the back of his mind is plotting the revenge of his father and his brother. The last scene is iconic and intense. You have the pure sacred baptism of Connie's sweet little baby with the congregation being asked to renounce sin, Satan contrasting with gory scenes of the 5 family heads gunned down graphically, one is having a massage being gunned down by a hitman through his glasses, another is trapped in a hotel of St. Regis and gunned down through he glass doors, another is gunned down in an elevator by Clemenza, another is gunned down in bed with his mistress all the while you see scene. The vendetta is final and complete. In the end, Michael exacts his cold revenge from Connie's husband who is led away in a car and garroted. In the last scene, he lies to Kay and she watches him being silently hailed while the caporegimes kiss his hand and the door slowly closes, it was an awesome scene. In sum, it's movie of deep family love, traditions and culture, betrayal, passion, greed, revenge, innocence turning into evil and that no matter how powerful you are there is always someone more powerful who will gun you down. Godfather is the best movie I have ever seen in my life, nothing compares.", "One of the greatest films ever made.": "Well where to begin this film for me is the pinnacle of film. Its beautiful in every way. The music, acting, scenery, is virtually perfect. Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan.", "What can I say? One of the truly great films. (SPOLIERS)": "After posting my thoughts on part II, I decided to give equal time here. Part of why GII was such a terrible movie is because this was such a great one.Coppolla does his best work when he is under career threatening pressure, and perhaps this was it. Here you see what happens when his ego doesn't get in the way, and when that happens you can see his technical genius.Brando gives the best performance, and one of the great performances of all time by any actor in film. James Caan was perfect. Enough said. The restaurant scene with Al Pacino and Sterling Hayden is indelibly etched on my brain as the most chilling experience I've had in a motion picture. Bravo.The set, the camera work, the music, the writing, the dialogue, all work cohesively. The hospital scene is an excellent example of creating tension. Quite honestly, I didn't think Coppolla was capable of such Hitchcockian style direction. If you haven't seen it, you have something to look forward to. There are few movies that I would recommend more than this one.", "\"It's not personal... It's strictly business\"": "IN THE LOVING MEMORY OF:Santino Corleone 1916-1948 (known as the \"hothead\")'Don' Vito (Andolini) Corleone 1892-1954 (in 1945 Vitos life was the mark for assassination, unfortunately it didn't go down so well for the people who did it, as Vito survived the attempt.

During times of hardships, audience flocked to their local cinemas to catch the latest flick, which invigorated Hollywood's movie studios to create imaginative & lavish films. This subsequently lead to the creation of some of the most innovative & influential films during the 20th Century. Among the list of 20th Century masterpieces is the critically-acclaimed film The Godfather (1972). Based on the novel by Mario Puzo & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather breaks all norms of the film industry. A phenomenal cast, a powerful soundtrack and an enriching plot propels The Godfather into a high standard of films. By the end of the film, the audience would be persuaded to sympathize with the Corleone family & their \"business\". The Godfather should be on everyone's bucket list for \"Movies to Watch Before You Die\". Stop reading this and go watch it if you already haven't!", "The Godfather is the answer to everything in the universe....": "Yes its a guy line and this is by far the greatest guy movie ever made. Any man who has watched The Godfather knows how much this movie would have touched him and his soul. He would have felt like going into a parallel universe and coming out refined. Such is the sheer magnitude and power this movie commands. A long story about one great gangster is not a story about a gangster itself. It is the story of every human that you see in the world everyday or every father you see everyday. It is a story of a father who is trying to pass on his legacy to this sons and as always there will be a son who will want to make it on his own. But there comes a time when the son will realize that family comes first.The steeling portrayal of Don Vito Corleone by Marlon Brando will be one of the most haunting performances that you will ever see on screen. The deep voice, the heavy face with a small frown and the look which says even if you point a gun a gun to my face I will still blow your head off is empowering and scary at the same time. But the subtleties and pain of a man who has power are the things you might remember about him the most. Then comes the young Italian Al Pacino. He looks like the wimpy son of a army general dad but dare you not forget that the blood of the king of gangsters runs through him. He is not muscle, he is the brain. The way he just sits down and thinks about his moves and executes them in deadly precision makes him just as good a Godfather as his father. The remaining members of the cast consisting of James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton etc. are all extremely praise worthy. The bottom line is that this movie had the best cast, the best direction and the best script in the history of cinema. The flow of this magnum sized cinema is amazing as it does not let the viewer off its leash. The intricacies of the film and the way it swerves and squirms and rolls and down right destroys sometimes is amazing.For Mario Puzo's book, the brilliant screenplay, the brilliant cast and just about everything associated with this movie it gets a 10/10.

I have never watched a film this long before then decided to sit down and watch it again. I've seen plenty this long and although I enjoyed them and watched parts of them again, I have never watched one like this all the way through. Let's take your standard gangster film, either you have the new guy just arrived in town looking for trouble, Joe from 'A fistfull of dollars', or you have the guy looking for revenge, Porter in Payback, or the cop trying to stop them, countless films. THIS IS DIFFERENT!! Sure you might say gangsters have been the guys your rooting for before but no not like this. You start with an established family, and you watch them fall into the ruin and gradually get saved. Brando and Pacino both deserve every award there is for making characters who although are often bad you can still see the old fashioned hero in. Not one bad actor, not one bad character. Not one bad moment. Yet why isn't it no. 1? Well I don't know but it isn't really no. 1 material. Perhaps its the fact you have so much story to take in and so much happens that you aren't sure whats just happened or it could be simple. I could have just expected a no. 1, a film that had me crying, cheering, yelling. I didn't get that but I cant think of one better gangster film, or one other film that deserves to be a classic like this. So perhaps it is a no. 1, for now until a true no. 1 comes along. For those of you who say 'the book was good, not sure if I want to see this', then I'll tell you this. This film is a book. not only is it a book, it's a great book. You cant put it down but when you do you can start anywhere. You can flick back to clarify what has happened, the story is well structured the characters well developed. It's well cut as if it's been edited by a publisher. I don't want to call this no. 1 because when you see it you'll constantly be judging it as a no. 1 film, like I was, and you will feel let down. However if you see it not expecting a no. 1, you will finish it having seen a no. 1.", "this is the film that made me fall in love with movies": "I am not going to tell you why I think this film is great. There are very few films that have been discussed so intently as this one (Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the only two that come to mind that might be more respected) and there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Also, I'm not going to try and change your mind, it's probably already set and if you are anything like me, it's not changing anytime soon. Besides, film is art not science and art is about emotion. No movie has meant as much to me as The Godfather, let me tell you why. I think I got hooked on movies because I am an obsessive person. If I read a good book I must read ALL of the authors work--two days into The Road, I had ordered McCarthy's other nine books. Everybody loves movies. I bet one in three adults hasn't touched a book in over a year but most of us make our pilgrimage to the local multiplex at least once every month or two and there are a handful of movies--whether they be Citizen Kane and 400 blows or Die Hard and The Rock--that we'll watch whenever they're on TV. At eleven or twelve, I certainly had my list of favorites but most of them were simply entertaining. I've since learned to appreciate Raiders of the Lost Ark as a piece of film making and ET as a genuinely brilliant work of art (its one of those movies you loved as a kid but love even more as an adult) but the Godfather was really the first movie that blew me a way. I may not have been able to tell you why but even back then i could tell, this was something special, this was a work of art. This film, along with its sequel (I like to think of them as one movie, mainly so I don't have to pick a favorite) Have topped my list of all time favorites for as long as I care to remember. Often I've wondered if its simply because of how strong my initial reaction was after that first viewing but every time I re watch it, from the beginning or starting in the middle, I'm reassured that it truly is the greatest film of all time. 'I believe in America,' still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, right down to the final scene when they close the door. The baptism is one of the greatest scenes in cinema, or is it the one at the toll booth, or at the wedding, or in the restaurant. There are too many. It is a film that doesn't just work at every level, it works perfectly at every level. If you have not seen this film you cannot say you love movies. American cinema may not have began here but every film since has been made in its shadow. It is the greatest film of all time and will never be topped, Period.", "Great film": "This is a wonderful film I really enjoyed this movie", "My headline couldn't do this film justice.": "If you're reading this, and you have seen the film, you know what I mean.If you're reading this, and you have not seen the film, then stop reading my review, and any other review, and either watch the film, or just don't bother looking up anything directly related to the film ever again, because you're wasting your time.", "Part 1": "Don't get me wrong, it was good, a pretty damn good film. But I read the book before I saw this film so I felt like the audience got skimped out on a lot of great and important details. And I'm sorry to say but Brando did not give The Don the justice he deserved. In the book The Don is beyond words. And Brando was simply excellent.Overall though I really dug it, I'm excited to see part 2", "Overrated! Vastly inferior to the second film... (Very Minor Spoilers)": "The first 20 minutes of this film were slow. But then it took off and the plot got more and more interesting until some stuff happened and the main protagonist had to go to some foreign place. After that, it became a bore-fest filled with long drawn out scenes that added \"little to nothing\" to the plot. Like the guy's foreign wife... What was the Point of That!!? Fortunately, It ended in a pretty bad@$$ and brilliant manner. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie were pretty great. Still, that doesn't excuse the amount of filler and lack of character development for the characters that were actually important in the next film. That includes The protagonist too. (His Character Arc wasn't handled very efficiently. He was a lot better in the second movie.)", "Very long winded and disappointing !!": "I was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created, it was no.1 in the IMDB chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted \u00a312 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours!! if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre !!", "The Ten Lessons I Learned With \"The Godfather\"": "The Ten Lessons I Learned With \"The Godfather\"Lesson I:\"A truly rich man is one who has powerful friends.\" Surround yourself with people as much or more influence, intelligence and power you have. They will be useful to ensure a good view them from society.Lesson II:\"Do not hate your enemies, disrupts reasoning.\" The less they know who your enemies are, the better. There cautiously and methodically based on their reason. In a game of chess the player only announces the \"checkmate\" to finish the opponent.Lesson II:\"Truly great men were not born great, they became great.\" Man must make your destination and never sit and wait for their arrival. Sartre once said:\"Man is born, finds himself in the world, and then he sets.\" Note that this definition is never final.Lesson IV:\"Let your friends underestimate your qualities and your enemies overestimate your faults.\" Show your real \"I\" for their actions in the world. Words have power, but their actions only make them powerful. Therefore, learn to ignore all the praise and unnecessary harm to his ego.Lesson V:\"He'll make a great offer.\" Always have more than one ace up his sleeve, so you can make anyone surrender to your desires. Learn to create traps for people to enter, even unintentionally, in your game.Lesson VI:\"Friends and business, water and oil.\" Mixing business with friendships is like letting a monkey watching a bunch of bananas, that is, it will not work.Lesson VII:\"If history has taught us anything, it's that anyone can be killed. \" Treat problems with accuracy and intelligence and you can delete them one by one. Plan your actions always in view the order you want to achieve. Here goes that maxim: \"the end justifies the means.\"Lesson VIII: \"A man who is not devoted to his family, is not a real man.\" Put the welfare of his family before everything. As it will be your foundation, its stronghold. If she is not well, you surely will not be. Remember that the family did not constitute just those who have blood ties with you, some friends are like brothers.Lesson IX:\"Learn to hear all opinions and never tell what you're really thinking.\" For most people disagree with us, it is highly recommended listen to what they mean. They can say something you had not noticed, or have an innovative vision on the subject. However, speak only what is necessary. Don't go around telling what you like or dislike, what they do, finally follow this idea: people just need you to know about what is absolutely necessary that they know. Just beyond can harm you in the future leaving you vulnerable in the face of certain situations.Lesson X:\"Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer.\" Nothing to declare war on your enemies openly, it improves your mental alertness. Keep it close so you can confuse it with false information about themselves. Let him think that is part of your team, and then when he least expects it gives the boat quickly.Extra Lessons Lesson XI:\"Do favors.\" By doing so people will always have the feeling that something should you and one day you may charge them these favors.Lesson XII:\"He who depends on others depends on shadows.\" The focus here is not about not depend on anyone, but, knowing the right people you could tell that in time of need you do not stay in the hand.Lesson XIII:\"The enemies of your friends are your enemies too.\"Do not take a traitor to his true friends. Learn enjoy them without hurting the friendship. If you are friends with someone just because it is something you should have in common, then everyone who meddle in his way are getting in yours too.", "Wow very good": "Film that passes a cool feeling.

Starting from the foundations of one of the greatest novels (kudos to Signor Puzo) it gains tremendous strength from the greatest acting, directing, producing and scriptwriting that one can come across.", "The older the better": "I guess it's the fourth time I watch this movie and it seems to be getting better as I watch it again and again. Movies about the mafia are one of my favorites. I just loved The godfellas, Casino, Once Upon a Time in America but The godfather is diferent it not just about mafia. Its about a family completely involved in mafia. As some one have written here, the changes in Michael's ( Al Pacino ) personality are incredible. One of the best part is the baptism. Meanwhile Michael is at the church, his fellows show how will it be to deal with the Corleone's.In a few words, watch it and also watch The godfather, part 2.It's a pity but the third part of the trilogy isn't as good as the first ones.", "the best movie of all the time": "a very exciting and interesting movie,including a lot of good acting specially Al Pacino as Michael Corleone ,which make you think about many things. a movie consist of cruel,clever,killer and of course lonely characters. a movie about violence,about mafia and about the life of us ,the true life of us.", "The Godfather.": "The Godfather is a classic movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's about a mobster family where the whole family is involved except one, because he's a college student. The family didn't want to involve him because he had a good educated head on his shoulders. When his father is out one day, there is a mafia hit on him; however things don't go as planned exactly. Long story short, the dad ends up in the hospital and the educated son feels the need to get involved and help his father out. To my surprise, the son who didn't want to be involved finds himself completely wrapped up in the mafia lifestyle. Shockingly due to previous mob movies that were not as popular with the box office, Paramount Pictures was very hesitant to adapt this film. It was a good thing they did because this was the start up to many successful mob movies. Mario Puzo is the author of the book \"The Godfather\" and thanks to the success from the book, the movie was able to be produced. In my opinion, I love the cast. Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he is known for mafia movies. I was shocked to find out he was almost fired from being in this movie! I can't imagine what it would have been like without him. All of the cast took their roles really seriously and met a lot of mobsters to really get the feel of the role.One of the most important thematic elements is the very first scene when the bride's dad goes into the room to ask a favor from the Godfather. This is important because it shows how respected and powerful the Godfather really is. That scene was really good for character development and plot. Italian lifestyle is a big part in this movie and one of the ways its portrayed is through the language. Throughout the movie there are some parts that are fully in Italian. Even if you're not Italian after watching this movie you'll be sure to feel like you are. Violence is a big thematic element in this movie. It is constantly happening in almost every other scene. Violence and death are big parts in the Italian/ mafia lifestyle and thats how it always was and always will be. A very important scene happens right off the bat, Coppola didn't waste anytime! The father is shot, and was supposed to be killed. This is the motivation for the sons change of heart and priorities in life. Another important scene is when Michael goes to visit his father in the hospital bed. While he's in here he has his eureka moment and saves his fathers life. All in the same five minutes another important scene takes place. As Michael was leaving the hospital he runs into a dirty cop who is also in touch with the mafia, and there is an altercation, you'll have to watch to see what happens next! When Michael gets up his confidence, another crazy scene takes place. Michael became sneaky and learned the ways of the mafia. He goes into a sit down with the guys that are above him on the mafia ranking and when he goes to the bathroom he takes the gun that he planted prior to the sit-down and kills all the men at the table. Obviously this is a key point because it shows Michael's growth. The last important scene happens after a lot of deaths take place. There is really no one left in the family so the responsibility of running the family business falls into Michael's hands. This movie has a lot of story lines which only makes the movie more interesting. Obviously the mafia is a big one. In the first minute were in the room with the Godfather, the boss. Another storyline that unfolds is family relationships. The son, Michael didn't want anything to do with the mafia but once his father got involved he had to do what was right and stand by his father and help out anyway possible. Business is another storyline that keeps the movie moving. The Godfather's famous line is \"I'm going to make you an offer, you can't refuse.\" Every time the Godfather says this you know some type of business exchange is about to go down.I think the director did an amazing job of putting all of these story lines together. There was never a dull moment in the film from the first five minutes to the last. It wasn't like he added unnecessary scenes or additional story lines to make the movie more interesting, everything had a purpose and had me at the edge of my seat the whole three hours!The most important relationship that is developed in this film is the relationship between Michael and not only his father, but the whole family. He was always the outcast of the family because he never wanted to live the Italian lifestyle but as the movie rolls on, he becomes closer and closer to the lifestyle and more importantly, his family. By the end of the movie Michael's life becomes the whole family business, and let's just say there's a new Godfather in town.", "A true test of times": "Francis Ford Coppola was once asked why \"The Godfather\" had been placed amongst the greats of American Cinema.  His answer:  longevity. \nLongevity in the cinematic world is a piece of work that stands the test of time.  A film is amongst the greats when it doesn't conform to the current pop culture or the specifics of issues.  The Godfather is not only an example of \"some mafia movie,\" but rather an example of an excellent storyline adaptation, great actors accomodating to their roles, and simplicity in shots that show how pictures are worth 1,000 words.  (Take into the consideration of the film coming into the scene during 1972, which is such a minuscule moment in camera development and shot technology compared to the everyday advancement of computer graphics.)Francis Ford Coppola works well with Mario Puzzo to turn such a great novel to such an excellent movie.  The only backstep is that the novel gets more indepth with the character of Johnny Fontane.  However, the focus is still on \"family values\" in general, and displays the actions of a mafia.  Al Pacino (although undermined by film producers to play the role of Michael) is excellent with his gestures and voice confidence as the film proceeds. The lighting is also an admirable display of how simple shots can be more wholesome and effective.The Godfather is a great film that truly denotes a stand through the test of times.", "An American Classic": "The Godfather is a definitive example of cinematic perfection.  There is nothing lacking from the film; acting, direction, cinematography; all perfect.  And, like any good American classic, it becomes better with every viewing.  Marlon Brando seems to get all the credit, but I believe Al Pacino delivered the film's greatest performance, as well as one of cinema's greatest.  The Godfather is timeless, and will be treasured for decades to come.Rating: 10", "Not #1": "When I saw that The Godfather ranked number 1 on the IMDb top 250, ahead of The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List, among others, I knew I had to see it.  I rented it and watched it through a couple times.  I'm having trouble figuring out why this is everyone's favorite.It's a well made film, probably top 50 material, but it really wasn't a intoxicating, compelling, or moving experience for me.  It isn't just a difference in taste, because I also saw The Godfather Part II, and that is one of the greatest films I've ever seen; top five material.  I just never got into The Godfather's storyline.  It's well made and all, just not the best, in my opinion.", "Its good": "Really good. I liked it. beings a biy slow but it works.", "Not for the modern day idiot nation, but incredibly good!": "I can understand why one might be bored by this film, it's three hours long and the majority of the American public can't wrap their puny minds around anything more complex than an episode of \"Friends\".  However, for anyone with an actual attention span (and i have ADD, so you should have a wider attention span than me), this film is a masterpiece. Sure it goes on for a while, but the story completely envelops you with the tension and the flavor of the tale.  The symbolism is amazing as Michael Corleone's appearance slowly changes as his character changes.  At the beginning of the movie, I didn't even recognize him as Al Pacino!So, if you think that \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" is a marvel in filmmaking, then you might want to pass this one by.

DON'T MISS IT THIS REALLY MASTER CLASS.", "Probably - if not definitely - the most overrated movie of all time": "In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close.The movie has been so hyped that I really was expecting to see the best movie all time when I watched it. What I saw was a decent flick with some very quotable moments, but in my mind the film has no singular or superior quality when compared to other great films. Monstrously overrated, but still a respectable movie.", "The best film ever made.": "Simply flawless,that's all there is to it.It's hard for me to talk about this film as I have nothing but good things to say about as it's my favorite film of all time.The whole cast is awesome,led by Brando's legendary performance as Don Vito Corleone,quite possibly my favorite performance ever.And Al Pacino became a star here as Michael,who goes from straight laced college man to cold-hearted mafioso.James Caan,Robert Duvall,John Cazale...I could go on and on.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is excellent,there's an amazing score by Nino Rota,the period detail is spot on.I love this movie to death.My number one film of all time.", "Hollywood's Finest": "The Godfather is in my opinion the second greatest movie of all time.

Stunning brilliant.10/10 Acting10/10 Story10/10 Pacing10/10 Adaptation from novel10/10 Overall", "Traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh.": "The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organised crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptised while Michael himself, the newborn \"Godfather\", is baptised in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed.", "Forever classic": "A movie that has been watch through different generations and still finding a place among the best. A true classic that will always be interesting to watch again.", "As good as its gets": "This is what movies are all about, a great cast, wonderful performances, intresting characters, stand out scenes,lovely score and a great story all into one. The film may be 3 hours long but the film is always watchable and never boring, and it does not feel like 3 hours long. This is the only film out of the three that the whole family is together, which makes it easily the best.The scenes that stand out are the horses head(of course), sonnys shooting, vitos last breaths,and the five killings at the end. I dont know what it is but the film and the other two  are never the same when sonny dies, apart from vito ,sonny is by far the most interesting character of the all the films even more than michael, i only wish he lived a little longer. Michael is never the same man when his brother dies, and never likeable again until the end of part 3.The last hour is all about michael,about being the new leader. Something which surprised me was that vitos character has long spells when he is not in the film, michaels probally in the film more and pacino should have won an academy award with brando. Is brando really an actor, the guy is so good, there has never been a better actor ever.My fav scenes are the ones where michael is in italy, they really are moving and lovely. This is the best film ever, no doubt", "One of the Greatest": "I watched The Godfather and I thought to myself what a fantastic movie! People say it's boring but it's not it's a slow paced epic, and there are parts in it that keep you engaged and never bored. I think that the scene where Michael kills the men in the restaurant might be one of the greatest scenes ever created. The attention to detail is outstanding, for example when Sonny beats Carlo and end the beating with a kick to the head and then when Sonny is killed it ends with Sonny being kicked in the head as a slight foreshadowing. Excellent film and should be experienced by everyone.", "The Greatest film ever made! What a movie!": "I sometimes wish I was alive in 1972 so I could see The Godfather in theaters. Some of the best cinematography and editing was produced in this movie. It tells the story of the mafia from the inside. It was amazing how the movie made you admire Don Corleone even though he was essentially evil. During the movie, the audience really doesn't see much it can disapprove of. No women are involved in prostitution, no lives are being ended by compulsive gambling, and no theft rings. In fact, the only real person outside the mob who is corrupt is a police officer with a significant speaking role. Brando is great with many memorable and quotable lines, and Al Pacino's performance in comparison to Brando's shouldn't be ranked to much further behind. A great ensemble of a cast and supporting players. Well done!", "A great film": "The Godfather became a seminal gangster-themed film. This film flew into popular culture \"from two legs\", and the phrases from it became truly winged. In many films, computer games, books, music, there are references to this film masterpiece. The film has become a cult classic and any list of films about gangsters or the mafia is impossible to imagine without mentioning The Godfather.In 1972, Francis Ford Coppola created a truly great epic about the life of a mafia clan, including internal tensions between related characters, as well as characters from outside the family. The gangster drama captured its elaboration of that world with Thompson machine guns, a strict hierarchy in the family, as well as cruelty and bloody methods to achieve the goal.I watched this film several times: in my school years and now, already at a more conscious age. Only after the second viewing, I realized why this film is so catchy and why it has become a cult. Many scenes of the film are remembered for a long time due to their staging and elaboration, starting from the most famous, the opening scene, where Vito Corleone pats the cat takes the undertaker and ending with the scenes during the christening. The horse head in bed is probably the most famous and sophisticated method of intimidating enemies, which is significantly different from torture with an iron or electric current. The scene with Michael Corleone and his two \"friends\" in the bar is admirable above all for its cunning. And the film is full of similar scenes that have migrated to other branches of art, including other films about the mafia or gangsters. Let's not go far, but remember the \"Brigade\", not as a comparison, but only as a continuity of one or another moment. Sasha Bely, it seemed to me, was completely written off from Michael Corleon with the addition of Russian flavor, and in the scene in the opera in the Brigade and in the baptism scene in The Godfather, it is simply impossible not to notice a certain connection between them. And this is just a single example. The Godfather created a separate art direction, thanks to which we can observe many wonderful and epic masterpieces.", "one of the best movies I've ever seen": "CLASSIC CRIME MOVIE good actors better director the best crime story I've ever seen.", "it's a masterpiece!": "It definitely defined a new cinematic way to see into the characters and their growth. It also created a new ground for mob movies. The cast was also a key element to the movie Coppola did an amazing job directing. Brando's way of portraying Vito Corleone was spot on. Same with al Pacino.", "Review The Godfather(1972)": "\"The Godfather,\" a 1970s film detailing the struggles of a Mafia family in post-World War II New York City, not only changed the face of cinema forever, but also resurrected a genre that had been dead since the Howard Hughes mafia opus \"Scarface\" hit the silver screen in the 1930s.Directed by then-novice Francis Ford Coppola, future mastermind behind \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"Tucker,\" and \"Youth Without Youth,\" \"The Godfather\" not only demonstrates poise and expertise in writing and directing but also in acting. Coppola put his career on the line fighting with power- hungry studio executives to get the actors he felt fit the roles. Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, youngest son of don Vito Corleone, expertly immerses himself in his character, down to the way he walks and talks, carries himself, and even shoots a gun in the famous \"gun behind the toilet\" assassination scene. Marlon Brando as the elder Corleone gives one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. With Robert Duvall as mild-mannered family consigliere Tom Hagen, and James Caan as the hotheaded Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone, every part is well cast and executed to perfection.Not only are the acting, writing, and directing top-notch, but so is the way the film is carried with great setting, music, and a feeling of authenticity. As Michael travels the picturesque hills of 1940s Sicily, \"Speak Softly Love,\" the famous tune by Nino Rota, transports audiences into the beautiful but deadly world of upper-class criminals. Everything in the film is well timed and well placed, offering the audience a portal into a life filled with twists and turns. \"The Godfather\" also reflects the fact that Coppola collaborated well with Mario Puzo, the author of the novel, and Coppola did a plethora of research to ensure the authenticity of his mobsters. The actors talk, eat, sleep, and kill like real-world criminals, embodying the swagger of high-rolling Italian mobsters. The dialogue flows from their lips as if Al Capone or Jon Gotti said it. \"The Godfather\" will go down in history as one of the most well made films of all time.", "Can a better movie be ever made... :-)": "What a masterpiece... ! My love and respect for the actors brings me here after 43 years of the film release. I think i am a terribly late entry into the fan club of this classic. Still I would say that even in 2015, this movie had a grip over me from start to end and left me with a hangover of its signature soundtrack.That's what make it a timeless classic i guess.. !The performances by all the actors are great. After you see the movie you have this feeling that \"can a better movie be ever made ?\" It is 100% craft. Best performance is that of Marlon Brando. You just cant ask for anything more. A must watch before you die. :-)", "A masterpiece of cinematography": "The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematography and one of the greatest adaptations of a novel in movie history,", "I'm amazed!": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say.

I hadn't watched a Charlie Chaplin movie for ages. I'd seen this a long time ago. I resurrected my admiration for the guy. First of all, the pure physical comedy is phenomenal. The choreographed fight scenes are priceless. Then there is his persona as a variant of the little tramp, this time as a Jewish barber who has had amnesia for twenty years. But the courageous parody portrayal of the disgusting figures of World War II is great. It it weren't so tragic it would be even funnier. Just the names of the figures alone are great. Paulette Godard is really fun and has a strong female voice. It's a terrific film in every aspect.", "I am not worthy": "This film is so flawless, I don't even feel worthy of reviewing it.

Casting Crew hit the goldmine with this one as Brando, Pacino, and James Caan Should be an illegal combination. No more should be said except perfection.", "I like this": "This Is good Movie. I like this movie very much. It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.", "Simply the best.": "This movie is the best movie ever made.  I find it hard to believe that there are some people who actually gave this movie a 1.  This movie is fiction yes, but the characters are based on actuall people and mobsters. Can you spot the one based on Frank Sinatra? Of course you can.  This movie has remained number one on many critics (both professional and not) for one reason.  It is simply the best.  If this movie doesn't grab you and hold onto you I don't know what would.", "Epic Journey into the History and Culture of the Mafia": "Spoiler Alert!! \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\"And with those words, Marlon Brando cemented his claim of film immortality. Many have imitated his cold, calculating stare, his borderline incoherent mumbling, and his movements which are, on the surface, awkward and elderly, but have an inexplicable gracefulness to them. But none will ever truly become Don Vito Corleone the way Brando did.His mere physical presence depicts years of harsh dealings with unscrupulous types, and yet somehow, we see honor, loyalty, and a sense of family devotion that is to be praised, not lamented. Roger Ebert, in his analysis of The Godfather, eloquently explains that part of the film's resounding charm and success is that it \"tricks\" you into sympathizing with people who commit unspeakable acts.Indeed, several have had their disagreements with the Godfather series because of its \"overly romantic\" portrayal of one of the most notorious groups in American history, the Sicilian Mafia. These people kill, cheat, lie, and scheme. And yet here lies the key as to why this film is one of the greatest ever made. Yes, many of the characters with whom we are supposed to identify are corrupt in many ways. But the further we are drawn into the microcosm of the Corleone family, the more we learn about these individuals that we initially shun as pure evil. The more we learn, the more human they seem, and we begin to see many signs of redeeming values.Mixed in with the lies, the crime, the deceit is a rich cultural history, and even more immediately, an ongoing battle for a piece of the coveted American Dream. Amongst the violent background, there can be honor and virtue, and with so many gray areas, we wonder if these supposedly horrible people are really evil, or whether they might be unwitting byproducts of a ruthlessly violent tradition that does not allow them for any alternatives.This particular point applies much more to Vito himself in The Godfather Part II. In this first installment, it is his son Michael (Al Pacino) that is the true tragic character of circumstance. Being the youngest of three male children, Michael begins the story as the only one with no ties to the nefarious dealings of the Corleone family. The eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), is a perpetual time bomb waiting to explode and does not have Michael's scruples. The middle son, Fredo (John Cazale) is much more passive, but not very intelligent.It is for these reasons that Vito sees Michael as the key to legitimizing the family and washing away the blood of years past. We will come to recognize, however, one of the themes that echoes relentlessly throughout all three films: the sins of the past can never be fully purged.Now knowing what happens in all three films, it is painful for me to watch the monumental opening wedding sequence of The Godfather and hear Pacino speak the words, \"That's my family, Kay, that's not me.\" This comes, of course, following Michael's conversation with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) regarding one of his father's involvements with crime. We then see Michael insist that Kay join the family picture, despite her protests. This subtle shot suggests a symbolism that will become indicative of their relationship (one of the few subplots that extends through all three films).The opening sequence, which lasts for almost a full half-hour, is the wedding of Vito's youngest child and only daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Yet this half-hour flies by effortlessly as it introduces all the major characters fluidly and economically. Everything we need to know is expressed, often without dialogue (a tribute to the fantastic performances). And there is still time to revel in the joys of a rich cultural tradition, expressed by the myriad festivities.Shortly thereafter, however, the joy is replaced by dread, as we begin to learn of trouble brewing for the Corleone family. A powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) presents the heads of the \"five families\" (those with Mafia ties) with deals that will create huge profits. Only Vito refuses the deal, which also entails refusal to give aid to the other families through use of politicians, police, and members of the press that Vito has power over. His reasoning is that drugs is a \"dirty business\" that will destroy the families in the years to come. The public turns a blind eye towards duplicitous activities like gambling, liquor, and prostitution, but narcotics, he feels, is different.This refusal stirs up the beginnings of bloodshed and engenders nothing short of a violent tribal feud that will claim several lives. At great risk, of course, is Vito himself, and Michael becomes torn between his desire for a normal, legitimate life with Kay and devotion and care for his father and family. Unfortunately, his father's immediate danger causes his concern for the family to win out, and we begin to watch the great tragedy of Michael turning from innocent outsider to ruthless manipulator, even more so than his father. This happens following his guarantee that he would never follow in his father's ways.Along the way, we become witness to some of the most suspenseful and well-thought out scenes in cinematic history, not the least of which is the scene almost directly in the middle of the film. In this scene, which excruciatingly defies time and seems to extend indefinitely, Michael must choose whether or not he will commit the final act that will secure him as a participating member in the family's illegal ways.It is the painful watershed, and again, knowing what happens down the road, I often find myself wanting to scream out, \"No, don't do it!\" To be compelled to do this towards a movie I have seen repeatedly means two things. First, yes I know, I am a freak. But what an achievement it is to have a film so well directed, shot, lit, and written that it stops being fiction and takes over you, despite repeated viewings.In addition to these moments of suspense, The Godfather also has one of the most romantic sequences I have ever seen on film. This is, of course, Michael's encounter with the young Sicilian girl, Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli). The breathtaking cinematography of the Sicilian countryside and the exquisite melodies of Nino Rota's Sicilian Pastorale perfectly capture the ambience of Michael's capricious affair.Needless to say, The Godfather is filled with memorable performances. Of the five nominees for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscar ceremony for the films of 1972, three of them belonged to The Godfather. These belonged to Al Pacino, James Caan (for his explosive performance as Sonny), and Robert Duvall (with a low-key, but highly effective performance as Michael's half-brother and consigliere to the family).None of the three won, but Marlon Brando did win the Best Actor Oscar (and later declined to accept it as a gesture against the poor treatment of Native Americans by the industry at the time). There are also a number of memorable smaller roles, such as Lenny Montana as the oafish Luca Brasi; Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as Vito's assistants, Tessio and Clemenza; and Sterling Hayden as the corrupt police captain, McCluskey.Despite a monumental directorial effort, Francis Ford Coppola did not receive the Best Director Oscar, but he did share the screenwriting Oscar with Mario Puzo for the adaptation of Puzo's novel. Special note should be given to cinematographer Gordon Willis for his phenomenal use of lighting. Few films I have seen make such heavy use of shadows and darkness (there are a number of medium and close shots in which we cannot see the subjects' eyes), and Willis's work here leaves an easily distinguishable impression.Then, of course, there's the climax during the final 20 minutes of the film, which is nothing short of a masterwork of editing, cross-cutting, pacing, timing, and style. The music during this sequence is so perfectly chosen that it never gets old no matter how many times I watch it. The sequence drips with an irony of the highest magnitude. Some have cited it as their favorite moment in film history.The Godfather truly is a film unlike any other. Some films make good epics, some good character studies, some good tragedies, some good action or suspense films, and some good historical dramas. It is hard make a single great film in any of these categories. The Godfather does it in all of them.By the end of the film's 170-minute length, we have witnessed a complete 180-degree shift in several characters' lives. Yet still, only part of the story has been told. The harsh sense of tragedy, loss, and deceit that accompanies the end of this film is something that only expands and deepens with an even greater destructive resonance in The Godfather Part II.", "Wow!": "A very well known classic film. The story is what keeps me coming back to this. A mafia boss' son that has managed to stay separate from the family and their dealings, only to gradually be drawn back in as his father's life comes under threat. The transition of this early conflict of the main character is the main force behind this film. Pacino's performance is stand out as one of the best performances of all time. That would be good on its own but there's so much more to offer. All the characters are well fleshed out and Coppola's direction of slowly letting the story unravel whilst giving the actors time and space to portray their characters is genius. Highly recommended.", "The Greatest Movie Of All Time": "I can remember the first time I  saw this movie, it just totally blew me away. There has never been a better movie and there never will be a better one and I'll tell you why. Everything came together for this movie, the acting, music, screenplay, setting, the characters and the story. It did something rare it brought crime and family together in an almost mythical way. Also it brought Marlon Brando (The Godfather) as a passing Don to a new generation (Al Pacino), in essence the transfer of  power  was being passed from one generation to another Brando to Pacino, and in the second movie it was Brando to DeNiro. Aside from their great performances, James Caan and Robert Duvall were flawless. James Caan turns in the performance of a lifetime as Sonny Corelone, and Duvall is flawless as Consilgere to the Don. If you have read the book you know will know why it was perfectly transfered from the book to the big screen. Their will never be legends such as Brando and Pacino ever again, they became the characters, they weren't acting, THEY BECAME the characters. I still get chills down my spine at the end of the movie when that the door closes and the transfer of power is complete from Father to Son. Don Corleone to Michael. It is unforgettable, and the legend grows with every viewing of the film.", "If you like the Sopranos, check this out...": "If you are a big fan of the HBO TV series the Sopranos, you should check out this movie.  It's not quite the same, the Godfather has more of a straight forward plot, with out the clever twist and turns and various subplot of the Sopranos, but it's still pretty good.  Marlon Brando basically play the Tony Soprano part and I think he's definitely as good as James Gandolfini.  Al Pancio's good in it, too.  This movies is really an under-rated gem, but you should be able to find it at most larger video stores.  You should rent this one for sure.  With that being said, it has a few problems, there's no nudity to speak of in this movie like there is on the Sopranos and while there is a beheading of a horse you don't get to see so much, like when Tony and Christopher cut off Ralphie's head.  Oh, check out the two sequels, they're both alright, too!8 out of 9 stars", "What was all the fuss about?": "Well, sitting back and watching objectively as I could, I saw The Godfather for the first time last night.I thought that since there is so much reference to this movie in comedy, drama, satire etc, that there must be some substance.Sadly not really. How this movie got to the top of the 250 is a mystery I'll never understand. Even Citizen Kane is a better view than this item.Perhaps this film was groundbreaking in its day, but frankly, Marlon Brando was laughable (as usual), the characters were stereotypical (though I guess they are the model for a generation of stereotypes that came after), and the story unremarkable. Kind of like the Thorn Birds meets Married To The Mob.That said, the film was OK. I gave it 7/10, but it got an extra point or two for having influenced so many other movies.Give me the Sopranos any day.", "My 2nd Favorite Movie": "Perfect.  That is the only word that can truly describe this epic.  Truly one of the few films that deserved a Best Picture oscar.  Coppola and Puzo have given us a story that is at a shakesperean level.  Honor, Family, Loyalty, these are what is important to these characters and you see it. The characters are so real that you communicate with them.  I found myself talking to them and yelling at them.  You feel for these people.  Truly this is more than a movie, this more than a film, this is the epitome of what all movies should be.", "Great moments, but disjointed and slow in parts": "Some memorable sequences, in particular a string of assassinations intercut with the family at church, but too many overly long scenes.  To me the film seems disjointed, and is let down by poor central performances (yes poor) by Brando (hammy), Pacino (stiff) and Keaton (invisible).The Conversation, which Coppola directed a couple of years later, is a better film, with a brilliant performance from Hackman.  But even that takes an hour to get moving.", "all time classic": "I didn't see this movie until i was 18 or 19 and now I'm glad I did, and im telling you, once you see the first one, your hooked and you can never see the second and third soon enough. I still have a hard time believing that Mario Puzo, knew nothing of the mafia, but for a guy that didn't know much, I don't think his movie was so bad, lol. and for some of the commentors that say that this movie drags on too long i say, if you can't appreciate it because you have the attention span of a 5 year old, go watch cartoons on the disney channel and keep it to yourself, this movie doesnt have a weakness. the story explores many things about life and society, one of which being that, in the character of Michael Corleone, the will of evil is too often, stronger than the human heart. the entire movie was put in a very dark setting without a single bright spot, I dont think real gangsters go through their entire lives in the mob without laughing or having fun, even periodically, but I can believe the fact that for the most part there lives are pretty devoid of happiness. The concept of Vito being forced out becuase he didn't want to deal in narcotics explores that the gang world is also so devoid of morals that there is little or no room for them and that showing any is a sign of weakness, and if you do, your likely to get forced out by somebody more agressive and with less of a concious.", "A movie deserving of it's IMDB ranking": "While this isn't my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in my top 10. I've probably seen this movie a half dozen times, but I recently watched it again for the first time in about 15 years. If you haven't seen it lately, it's worth watching again.", "Poignant": "This film blurs the lines between a common business man and a mobster. From the opening scene with Bonasera, you could see so much emotion in it. The room is properly lit and the characters have a certain aura that surrounds them. You see the room is dark but the characters make the room bright. The opening scene alone is already worth the ticket. It has so much depth and emotion on the things that are happening in that world. This film shows you perfectly how respect and wit can get you through the wicked world. I recommend this to everyone who are knowledgeable and are discriminating mobsters then think too high on political figures. This film is a perfect 10/10", "The best film of all time": "This definitely deserves to be the top film in the IMDb.com 250 best films. It has so many memorable scenes which will live in the memory of those who see this film for ever. Scenes such as the wedding at the beginning, the shooting of the Don, the death of Sonny, Michael outside the hospital and when he's in the restaurant when he kills Sollozzo, the death of Vito in the garden and perhaps the best of all, the eventual hand over when Clamenza kisses Michael's hand and says \"Don Corleone\".Marlon Brando puts in a career defining performance in his portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant with Al Pacino showing that his casting for the role of Michael Corleone was inspired. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Caan as Sonny Corleone also deserve mention. The Cinematography is sensational as is the direction by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is even followed up by a sequel that all but matches this film in its brilliance. Quite simply the greatest film ever made!", "best movie ever!": "This is number one movie in the world!\nthis should be top of 250!", "Love this movie but...": "I love this movie but hate me if you will the second is better. Just facts!", "More action please.": "I watched this film last night because I heard Kanye West once said that it was an all time classic. Now I do respect the rapper and producer's opinion but I beg to differ.Firstly I found it quite boring, it just doesn't have the action packed pace of some of my personal favourite movies such as Weekend at Bernie's 2, Teen Wolf, or Kickboxer 3 : The Art of War.The acting wasn't great either. I know Pacino and Brando are decent actors but compared to performances such as Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club or Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack, it's seriously under par. It's easy to play a moody gangster but could you imagine Al Pacino playing Ross Geller in Friends? Me neither. The guy has no versatility.One more thing is the music wasn't too hot either. Just classical nonsense all the way through. By my calculations, The Godfather would be 37% better if there was a tad more Genesis, maybe \"Invisible Touch\" playing over the restaurant shooting scene.3/10.

One of the greatest movies ever made. Marlon Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: realistic anti-hero, villain with million of verges. It's also story about how one good man (war hero) become a genius of a criminal world. Every scene was directed with the soul. Combined with Part II. In this movie perfect everything: perfect characters, adapted screenplay, and original soundtrack. Film about relationship between family members, loyalty, honor in life of gangsters and revenge.

I just watched this movie again and the scenes of Micheal whacking the crooked cop and the other mobster family head and the scene where the director wakes up to find his favorite horse's head and blood all over and beneath his feet still shocks and stuns me... this movie portrayed the drama of it all elegantly and I love every minute of it. Although 2 things are odd... In the beginning when the first Godfather is being begged for help I was surprised that the beggar wasn't killed off then for being so disrespectful to Don Corneioli (I hope that's how it's spelled). I mean this guy is an infamous, murderous mobster who's career started out practically with a murder (As seen in the future Godfather movie) but he'd let someone who left him disrespected alive seems so uncharacteristic of the man. And also the length of the first wedding in the movie, the very first few scenes of this film, well... was horrible, I'll not lie. At the risk of being stoned by those in love with this movie I have to say that they had achieved the desired effect after the first or second deal the Godfather made, not entirely sure which it was since the movie lasted so long but I'm pretty sure not past 2. The rest of it was very nice and all and showed how he did business (bloody and death-ridden beneath a velvety, beautiful cover) but was it really necessary to do so much of it?

RIP Marlon Brando, you were an excellent actor. The Supporting cast, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan are excellent. I know I am using the word excellent in this review, but its because everything in this movie is excellent. Propably the greatest gangster picture I have ever seen.

There are however a few exceptions to that, and on the very top of that list, is Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.This movie is pretty much flawless. The cinematography is fantastic, the music is beautiful and fits with the italian mafia theme perfectly, the performances from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in particular are among the greatest ever captured on film, and the film received 9 Academy Award nominations with 3 wins, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Brando.10/10 across the board for me, and may be the undisputedly greatest film of all time.", "I really don't understand what people see in this movie": "I just don't get it. Sure the acting in some parts of the movie is good, but honestly, the entire \"angry Italian\"-role is probably the easiest character to play. And i really don't get how every other character other then the \"angry Italian\" seems underdeveloped, plain boring and uninteresting. The only way for you to like this movie is by sympathize with the characters. And sympathizing with the bad guys (since almost every main character is a murderer and a mob member, even the protagonist is a bad guy)is difficult, although not impossible. If the director makes the evil sides of those characters redeemable, then it would be a lot easier for the viewer to sympathize and worry about the protagonist if he/she was in danger. When i however see Michael Corleone in danger in this movie, every time i wish for him to be killed, for i feel nothing for him. Which means that watching this movie was a waste of time.

It is nearly flawless, and was remarkably realistic. No need for mob stereotypes ..... Just a conservative portrayal of a family with deep roots. Remarkable, and a treat to watch over again. It's too bad Brando was a bit of a flake, because he is probably the best actor that ever lived. Every character is complex, but I think my favourite must be Sonny. A hot headed son who is expected to take the reigns of the family one day, in spite of older brother Fredo. I was a kid when it came out but I would love to see it on the big screen. I also find the ages of the actors interesting... Pacino and Caan were very close in age despite Caan as being portrayed as years older. Duvall is actually considerably older than those two.

That's absolutely brilliant.", "*shrug*": "well, i worked in a video store for five years and for five years everyone nagged me to see 'the godfather' and for whatever reason it simply never interested me. i love films but wouldn't consider myself a pedant who nitpicks about minor details. a film doesn't have to be entirely perfect for me to enjoy it or feel that it was worthwhile to watch. i like to get lost in a film when i watch it. be it a quick comedy or an epic saga. there are films that have plenty of continuity errors and even bits of really bad acting, and i've watched them several times, because it's a satisfying experience. well, i finally watched the godfather tonight. i finally felt ready to watch it without bias and without towing all the talk and hype behind it into the experience (well, i did the best i could to start with a clean slate, but couldn't always succeed. for example, i'm sure the horse head in the bed at the beginning would have been more shocking and effective if i hadn't heard that scene referenced thousands of times). overall, i have to say that i really wasn't very impressed, and, even before i remembered that it was, in fact, based on a book, i was left with that empty sensation of too much missing information and imbalance of characters that sadly happens with too many adaptations. also -- and as i said, i don't deliberately go seeking out errors, especially during a first viewing, but... -- the editing in so many parts was really bad enough to take away from the movie experience. it was difficult to pay attention to the dialogue because the cut-to's during some of the conversations were so blatantly recorded at different times that i forgot about my own involvement in the film and instead had to sit through these confusing cuts. likewise with the 40's atmosphere. i'll bring 'the hype' into the argument for a moment here to comment only in retrospection, but for all the talk of how classic and what a masterpiece this film is, i would have thought it to be more... i don't know... scrutinised? and there were just too many times when i would find myself involved in a scene, drawn in, convinced, fully attentive, and then there would be a completely random cut, even dialogue cut in mid-sentence when fading to the next scene. so strange. parts gave me the impression of watching a well-financed, well-meaning rough draft. all that said, some of the acting, not all, but some, was in fact, first rate. Marlon Brando really didn't convince me. he was good. but nothing special, i'm almost sorry to say. the wife (i forget her name) who was married at the beginning, she always seemed really out of place and ... i can't quite put my finger on it, but her fits just didn't flow with the film. i thought James Caan did a great job. i've only ever seen him in 'thief' and 'bottle rocket,' so i can't really make any worthy comparisons with other performances. but his hot-headedness was convincing enough. Robert Duvall was great. i didn't recognise him for almost the first half of the film. another acting gem for me was Al Pacino. he, too, i didn't recognise at the beginning of the film. for a few moments i mistook him for Adrian Brody, even though i knew that was impossible. but i was immediately drawn in by \"Michael's\" performance. every gesture and every word was electric. it took me about twenty minutes to realise that i was watching Al Pacino. then, furthermore, i was really impressed by the evolution of his character. that's one thing i think they really nailed solid with this film, from Pacino's acting to the storyline and editing and everything all rolled into one. i came away entirely convinced and ruminating on the life and thoughts of this character. i watched and admired the power he carried in his manner even when he was, in the beginning, insofar as the bloody family business was concerned, innocent. then saw that power unfold and transform itself until, in the end, he was finally consumed by the corruption inherent in the prioritisation of his blood-family's honour. however, apart from this character and a few other performances, there really wasn't enough \"meat\" to this movie to make me want to see it again. i'm curious about the sequel(s), to see where the story goes. but by the end of this first viewing i was mostly just wondering who was going to die next, and i didn't really care. i was plenty intrigued by Michael, but i felt like i was mostly sticking around to see who would be left standing by the time the credits rolled. maybe the whole mafia style depiction thing just isn't enough for me to be able to sympathise or feel anything when the next trench coat gets strangled or shot or stabbed. so, overall, there were indeed a very few classic moments, and some of the acting was really well performed. but on the whole it just didn't chalk up to much for me, least of all a masterpiece.", "Bring Back 70s movies.": "With the complete and total abscence of excessive computer effects, Godfather is impeccable on storyline, character development, and acting. No excessive violence. No excessive swearing. Simple how every movie should be.", "You straightened my brother out?": "What an absolutely marvelous movie! Ford Coppola is truly an amazing director, and so are the entire cast of The Godfather. If it weren't for the second film of this franchise, and also Goodfellas, I would've undoubtedly dubbed this as the best crime drama of all time.The movie starts out showing the full and yet uncorrupted Corleone family, with Don Vito Corleone as the head of the family, Sonny as the hot headed underboss, Tom Hagen as the Consigliere, Fredo as the weak brother who is something between a soldier and a capo and Michael, the youngest of them all who doesn't want to walk along the path of his father. Soon enough though, internal trust issues arise in the family as multiple assasination attempts are carried out on a few family members, of which, Michael takes revenge for.In an attempt to hide Michael from the ensuing drama, he is sent back to Sicily, where he finds new life and tries to start from there. But his short yet dark history follows him and he is left with nothing after going through all the things he has gone through. The innocent, brave war hero Michael is now willing to take on his father's shoes and bring the Corleone family its lost muscle and respect.In this movie, we see many things that current movie crews can learn from. From using lighting to cover heavy make-up, to an absolute masterful execution of a Juxtaposition right around the end, this movie has it all. All 3 hours of it is a beautiful learning and enjoyable experience.Also just saying, if you're watching this with kids, there's just a few seconds of upper-body nudity here from Simonetta Stefanelli and that's about it.

The First Godfather film involves the epic story of The Corleone Family, where each member is supurbly acted by a superb cast, top notch from the principle parts to the smaller ones. As head of the Corleone family Don Vito (outstanding Marlon Brando) is ambushed and shot and put to hospital, his sons, Michael youngest of them, unwilling heir of the family top spot (Al Pacino), hot head oldest brother Sonny (James Caan), and quiet middle brother Fredo (John Cazale) must take control over the family business while he is gone, and rely on Don Vito\u00b4s new consigliere Tom Hagen\u00b4s (the always great Robert Duvall) and end the conspiracy bestowed upon them. The story is perfectly vowen, marvelously executed violence scenes. It\u00b4s a movie that must be seen by any movie fan, this is as perfect as movies become. No different is The Godfather Part II, even possibly better than the first one, this movie however is longer and is split up as two stories intercutting in parts, one showing the life and rise of younger Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and the other his son Michael tightening his grip on his family business, alienating his wife kay (Diane Keaton) in the 1950\u00b4s. The third and weaker of the Godfather movies but not all that bad, involves middle-aged Michael legititimizing his earlier crime business, while trying to win back his ex wife Kay. However new enemies within and outside the family ultimatelky corrupts the business and resulting in his retirement, as his son in law Vincent (Andy Garcia) ascend as the new Don, with the help of Michael\u00b4s hardened sister Connie (Talia Shire). The weakest performances come from George Hamilton as Michael\u00b4s new lawyer B.J. and Coppola\u00b4s own daughter Sofia as Vincent\u00b4s cousin and lover, which isn\u00b4t to say Sofia is all bad but doesn\u00b4t really have the experience for this pivotal role. The Video transfers aren\u00b4t all that top notch showing some grain but never-the-less show flawless detail and color resolution, the audio transfers are deliverd in powerful detail and gives the subwoofer a run for its money. The special features are all good and interests showing good value, Coppola\u00b4s commentaries on all three movies is as informative and interesting as they come, commenting on the cast behind the scenes facts, the how\u00b4s and why\u00b4s, his feeling about the third movie\u00b4s pointlessness.

Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.

Brando, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Cazale are all outstanding as well...The Best...  period...", "Beautifully made film!!!": "This movie is excellent.  The only reason it's not my favorite movie is it's not that pleasant to watch.  In my opinion, The Godfather, Part II ALMOST matches this.  What puts Part I over the top for me is Marlon Brando.  He is unbelievable.  Also, Al Pacino's performance was Oscar worthy (correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he won).  His transformation was unforgettable. Overall, see this and the sequel, but skip part III.", "a good film but not the best": "The 'Godfather' is certainly a very good movie and i enjoyed it very much. But in my humble opinion there are many movies that are better than this one and its sequels.It is certainly overrated because people tend to concentrate too much on american films here. The acting of Marlon Brando is very good and makes this film something special.But anyway, at some point i got a feeling of watching some kind of soap opera because except for Brando's part the rest of the characters remain relatively flat. The music to this film is very good and contributed much to its fame. All in all i would be prepared to say it is among the best American films of the 70's.", "Slow but a lesson in story telling and film making": "The godfather is considered a classic, i now know why it is one of the most poetic movies i have seen. From the beautiful wedding scenes at the beginning to the unforgettable ending it is a lesson in film making. The story although very slow, is very good. The film does go on for a bit (about 3 hours) it can be watched in two sittings if you want to. The only gripe i have about this film is that it could be considered as a two part mini drama on TV (although a very very good one). The acting is outstanding Marlon Brando makes one of the most memorable characters ever and a young Al Pachino is also very good.Over all though excellent ill give it a score of8/10  (and a proud place in my film colection)", "The best movie ever": "It is always difficult to talk about classic and no doubt \"The Godfather\" is a classic, in fact, one of the greatest of all time.

No doubt the best of the film is the direction, which is an exquisite class! With an absurd Coppola will calm counting frame by frame this story that could have been done in a hurry the basis of chases and shootouts endless. But on the contrary, with few action scenes, the director uses all his talent to focus on very rich scenes with good use of light, sound, photography, performances and spectacular dialogues, all working in harmony and building this history that is intertwined with the dirt permeating the mafia and at the same time love and loyalty that is due to the family.", "The best movie ever.": "Adapted by the book with the same written by \"Mario Puzo\" comes \"The Godfather which is literally acclaimed by the critics as the best movie of all time.

It was a Film so good that I cannot stop thinking about how good it is.I am most impressed with its development of Michael. How he was not even an understudy to his brother but yet became the head of the table. His keen observation and probably his Military skill helped him.Don Vito Corleone is a smart, cautious, and patient man. He only strikes when necessary. He tries to avoid trouble at all costs.

The story is classic and simple, leaving it easy and fun to follow. Every scene moves the plot forward to the next scene. There are so many great moments in the movie that're still studied by young filmmakers today. The only weak point of the movie is the character arc of Michael Corleone, while he is a well written character I feel like it's nothing we haven't seen before in a film. Overall there isn't a single thing wrong with the film and it's one of the best movies ever made.", "Jesus Perfect!!!": "PROS: Just flat out great, it is a instant classic you cannot get any better when it comes to Mafia movies.

If that's your sort of thing, I can see why you'd rate it highly, but otherwise it's fairly forgettable. I wouldn't have bothered with a review if I didn't think it's rating and acclaim were so misplaced.The acting was good, and there are some memorable scenes, but spaced out far too much - 3 hours is a very long time for a film with such an aimless and meandering plot. There are lots of story threads introduced throughout the film, but none of them really stuck with for long enough to get invested in the characters or what was happening.", "Welcome to the Family": "As what Marlon Brando says \"kiss my hand, call me your Godfather for justice...and friendship.

Theme is good, but not great. Redemption, Trust, and Family. This Italian Mafia takes over New York and the rest of Hollywood. I love this film because of the death of James Caan's character, Sonny.

The crime in this film is for most a epic movie there's guns murder and love. The scene where the narcotics team are getting messed up and they've chose to hurt each other is amazing seeing this people say there not gonna be like the dad and slowly turn evil is something of a masterpiece. This is a great film a master piece.", "Fav": "This has been a favorite for years. Never boring, always excellent, always new. No matter how many times I've watch this, it entertains.", "A Mafioso Masterpiece!": "The Godfather makes you an offer you can't refuse. The offer is that if you give up 3 hours of your life, you can see one of the greatest, and most thought provoking films of all time! Why? A number of reasons actually...1) The characters are multi-dimensional. Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt an evil person. He commits murders in cold blood, and sends especially brutal men (Luca Brasi) to do them. But, you wouldn't think so from he manner. He is a kind man, a dignified man, and a religious man who will do whatever he has to for both his families. He almost makes you forget (or want to forget) what his business is.2) It's obvious that a lot of research was done into this subject. In the 1950's and 60's, there was a mobster named Carlo Gambino who appeared to be a very gentle being, but became one of the most power mob bosses ever! Sound a bit like Corleone? Bugsy Siegel built a gambling paradise called Las Vegas and his name became synonymous with casinos. Moe Greene anyone? Frank Sinatra was an old washed up lounge singer who got a part in \"From Here to Eternity\" through rumored mob connections. Johnny Fontane and \"Ol' Blue Eyes\" have something in common.3) It's true to the book! After film adaptations that feel the need to change this part of the story, or that part of the story, or even the ending, it's nice to see a movie that actually brings a story into reality. Sure they change this and that, and leave out numerous characters (Jules Segal, Nino Valenti, Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan... the two punks who maimed the undertaker's daughter, old consigliere Genco Abbandando {but he does appear in the 2nd one}, Wax Baines the pimp, etc.), and they had to take out certain things to keep the movie from being 5 hours (Like a stomach churning story about Luca Brasi's child.), but most of the story and dialogue was pretty much quoted from the book.I would recommend that you read the book first then see the movie(s), you won't regret either.", "The GREATEST movie ever <)": "you will learn a lot from this movie about life, love, revenge, growing up, power, friendship & the most important of course Family :)) the relationship between Micheal and his father it's alone need another movie.. how Micheal character complicity changed but he still the same, what could revenge and anger achieved when they exits in smart person.-It's not personal, it's just business. -I don't like violence, i'm businessman blood is a big expense. -Revenge is a dish best served cold -i'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse -Never hate your enemies, it effect your judgment. -Great men not born great, they grow great. the quotes in this film are endless.. it's a life guide movie not just another Hollywood movie.", "BEX": "It can be boldly said that this film is one of the eternal masterpieces of world cinema.

This atmosphere is very special and wonderful and it gives us a mafia feeling.", "Spanking!": "After watching this film I finally understood what a good actor really was. Pacino is spectacular and Brando is brilliant, all round excellent film.The plot works very well and is complex and simple depending on how much depth you want to put in it. Sadly quite a few people's attitude to the film is negative, they are missing out.The second godfather is excellent as well but the third is not really worth the effort.Pacino is worth seeing in most of his films, try Dog Day Afternoon, very good :-P", "Just Flawless": "The acting, direction, camerawork, dialogue, sets even; everything in this film is iconic.

The Godfather is the greatest film ever made. A 10 out of 10 rating just does not do it justice, there should be an 11 rating reserved just for films like this. The storyline is gripping from start to finish. The acting in this film is beyond brilliant, and there are so many classic scenes. In short it is more than a must see film. It is a fantastic synthesis of the cruel mafia underworld, and the story of the noble family behind it. What would I say to someone thinking of watching this? If you could only watch one other film before you die, then you would have to chose this one.It is the Perfect Movie.", "One of the best movies in history of Cinema": "This movie blows your mind away with its great cast. This movie is full of emotions and ups and downs. It depicts a father that has the will to do anything to keep his family safe and happy at any cost. It also shows how a man can be so cruel.", "fdfdf": "In its ten years of existence the \"Monsters on Vacation\" franchise managed to become a national hit, and its characters could be remembered not only by children, but also by parents. The cartoon series broke the classic notions about the characters of famous monsters and was a kind of satire on our troubled world. The famous animator Gennady Tartakovsky imagined the lifestyles of every monster as strongly reminiscent of human life, and so the situations of monsters and humans were similar: the head of a large family, Wolfych, was tired of work, and Murray the Mummy could not figure out the intricacies of romantic relationships.The main storyline was a family conflict between the vampire daughter who fell in love with an ordinary man, and her father, Count Dracula, who seemed too strange beloved. Raising topical themes made the first monster cartoon a success, which led to the release of several sequels. And if the second part held the bar of quality of the first film, the third became a failed sequel, which has lost the spirit of the first parts. The news that not only a fourth film would follow, but also a short film about pets, was hardly accompanied by hope for resurrection: it became clear that nothing good awaited this series anymore. \"Transformation\" was a kind of finale of the whole series, summing up the results of the previous parts. The plot centers again on a dispute between Dracula and his son-in-law Johnny, this time concerning the inheritance of the Hotel Transylvania itself, which Drac wants to leave to his children and retire. Johnny's succession is questionable: a popular place among monsters could be ruined in an instant. To gain the hotel owner's trust, Johnny decides to take the bold step of transforming himself into a monster with Van Helsing's magic beam. However, something goes wrong, and not only does Johnny become a monster, but Drac also becomes a human. To find an antidote, they must travel around the world together and finally find common ground. \"Monsters on Vacation: Transformation\" is a film that is unlucky in almost every way. First of all, it is worth noting that the film was supposed to be released last summer, but it was postponed for several months, and then it went straight to the online services. Another Sony animated film, Mitchells vs. Machines, had a similar fate, which only played to the cartoon's advantage. The problem of the impact of technology on human life was reflected in the real world, because many people watched the film on their gadgets. Here the situation is almost the opposite: \"Monsters on Vacation: Transformation\" is an adventure cartoon for viewing in cinemas during the hot summer vacations.It was also unlucky that the creator of the first parts, Gennady Tartakovsky, did not find the time to fully approach work on the final franchise. In \"Transformation\", he acted only as a screenwriter, and the duo of Derek Drimon and Jennifer Klusky (the authors of the short film about the pets who live in the hotel \"Transylvania\") were appointed as directors. Therefore, and jokes built on the visual uniqueness of the world, in the new part disappeared. And in general \"Monsters on Vacation: Transformation\" can hardly be called funny: the satire on the modern world is gone, and instead there are scenes about how the strong personality of Dracula is trying to break the conditions of the human world.The new part also lacked the charm of the main characters. Almost the entire old cast of monsters turned into pathetic caricatures: the Mummy took the image of an old man falling asleep on the move, and Frank became a brutal narcissist who brags about his muscles. There are also problems with the script itself, which simply brings nothing new to the table. The conflict between Dracula and Johnny from the first parts made its way into the fourth with little change: the differences between the characters were again an occasion for family arguments that only Mavvis is able to resolve. The lack of a field for new solutions became a tugboat for the development of old lines, so the transformation itself had no effect on the characters: Johnny is still a choleric, and Drac is a grouch who wants to find idyll in everything.The finale seems to bring the characters to the point where the picture began. Trusting Johnny, Drac gives the young couple the opportunity to rebuild the ruined Hotel Transylvania, but the youngsters create the same building, only changing the decor inside. Perhaps in this there are similarities with the cartoon itself, which remained a copy of the first parts, never becoming a logical finale for the entire franchise.", "WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING MY KRAUT-MICK FRIEND": "It would be easy to name a solid handful of decent Mafia movies but this is without doubt the Godfather of them all, A family tree through the ages vying for control of the crime family network.

It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie.", "Every aspect of the film was on point": "This movie was really good but the only problem i have is that it lasts too long in my opinion. With that aside, Coppola changed everything we know in film creating this masterpiece. Stratnig from the plot and the sound, incredible editing, lighting thought out well. Also ,the complete change of Michael's character because of the family which we see is the main priority in most of the gangster movies was outstanding . Marlon Brando who stayed so in character, and the lightning always above his head which shows no emption in his eyes, where he had to show it with his voice did a marvelous job. And Nino Rota who made music for Don Korleone as a light motive and all the other compositions made this movie 10x better. The editing ,with picture and sound, especially in baptism scene, was so incredilbe that it makes it one of the best moments of film history in my opinion. The ending also has a really powerfull message. There will never be movies like this again simoy because we entered the animated era with VFX being the best part of the film. It is no mistake to say Coppola did marvelous job with this movie and gained the respect all over the world. Genious.", "Winner!": "The godfather is one of the greatest movies ever put together. Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it's time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives.The costumes not only fit the time in which the movie was set for, but as each set ventured from one location to another they matched the costumes with the location and each scene appropriately. Additionally each character seemed to have their own sort of style they displayed through these costumes. If each character looked and sounded the same, a viewer could easily guess the character by the clothing they wore. The plot engages the movie beautifully. From the beginning to end it leaves the viewer having a very direct and excellent understanding of what is happening and how it ties in to the main story. Even through watching the movie multiple times and knowing what happens I can still avoid anticipating what will happen next because it is so well established and drawn out. Matching costumes, characters are captured in beautiful and well constructed sets. Viewers can actually watch the movie and though have never been to where the movie takes place, they are able to visualize and understand exactly where they are. This movie does an excellent job at not just focusing on where the action is but showing a larger portion of the picture to allow viewers to fill in any additional puzzle pieces that normally aren't formed but in some cases with some viewers is absolutely necessary to understand exactly where they are in each scene. The sound track is very emotional. The symphony sound texture to the music allows background music to be applied to a scene and assist viewers to visualize what is going on and the emotions to be expected while the scene unfolds without requiring the use of additional vocals. This is exceptionally beneficial at the beginning and ending of each scene, as it displays the mood of the scene as it starts out or leaves a lasting effect of whatever just took place. Last but not least the actors are the people who made the film what it was. Each role was very specific to the actor and very distinguished from one to another. In specific, the Don's sons Michael and Sonny, were extreme opposites. While one was very calm and easy going the other was very hot headed and gung hoe, looking for action and death to those who disagreed with him or stood up to the other family members. All in all the movie was wonderful from beginning to end ultimately I would not change a single thing or think something could have been done to better the film. I definitely recommend anyone who has not watched this movie already to check it out!", "A Tale of Family, Loyalty, and the Cost of Power": "The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone crime family, the film is a sweeping epic that tells the story of the rise and fall of a powerful Mafia clan.Brando's performance as the aging and complex Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary. He brings a depth and complexity to the character that is rarely seen in film, and it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. The rest of the cast is equally strong, with standout performances from Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton.The Godfather is a film that is rich in detail and character development. The cinematography is beautiful, and the score by Nino Rota is iconic. The film's themes of family, loyalty, and power are timeless and still resonant today. On the other hand, it is a pretty lengthy movie, that, from time to time, becomes a bit boring.Overall, The Godfather is a must-see for any fan of classic cinema.", "The Godfather 1972": "The Godfather is a Crime/Drama movie that was released on March 24, 1971. The movie was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and written by Mario Puzo and Franics Ford Coppola. This movie won several awards which include: Academy Awards, USA 1971; Golden Globes, USA 1973; BAFTA Awards 1973; David di Donatello 1973; Directors Guild of America, USA 1973, and many others. Main actors in this movie are Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.The movie takes place within the world of organized crime. This movie shows an inside point of view of the mafia world. Mr. Vito Corleone (main character) is a powerful man who is viewed as a man who is sympathetic, successful, and a loving family man. Mr. Corleone takes good care of his friends and family and in no way (through the whole movie) would do anything that reasonable people would disapprove of. Mr. Corleone takes revenge, executes, or teaches lessons to the ones who betray him in any way. This movie is not a typical crime/drama movie as it doesn't show victimization to anyone not involved in organized crime. Typical crime/drama movies do show victims such as women enslaved into prostitution, families torn apart by a family member who is addicted to gambling, drugs, or alcohol, and sometimes just innocent bystanders. The editing in this movie was very appropriate as the scenes transitioned smoothly throughout the entire movie. From beginning to end, the sequence of every scene was put nicely in place and made perfect sense for the viewer to understand where the story was going and why. Every single sound effect used was played well within each scene, making the scene effective in making it seem real to the viewer. When there are outdoor scenes the viewer can hear the wind, birds, traffic, and other outdoor noises. When the scenes take place indoors, the viewer can hear the footsteps, door shutting or opening, and other indoor noises, which are appropriate for the scene. When watching the movie, the viewer can see and feel the strong family ties, the loyalty within a social circle, and the betrayal. The movie makes it seem as if it is okay to get rid of those who do you wrong, it is okay to tell white lies, it is okay to do something that is wrong to protect your loved one. The cinematography of this movie was smooth with all scenes because they did close-up scenes whenever necessary, and in every single scene the viewer can follow the story to the next scene without wondering what is going on or why. There are some bloody and violent scenes; however, that is typical of crime/drama movies. Culture plays a big part in this movie, as there are parts where people are speaking Italian and are doing traditional cultural things such as in the wedding scenes when people are dancing and singing at Connie's wedding. There are also the scenes when Mike is in Italy, and he has to talk formally to the girl's father for permission to date her, the traditional visits to the girl's home and family and the traditional Italian wedding.The movie is trying to influence the viewer to believe that there are good people who have good morals and family values in the mafia world, and that it is okay to do something that is wrong or breaks the law in order to keep your family or friends safe or away from harm's way. I am not a big fan of mafia movies, and my opinion will not change about organized crime. I do know they have families, and they love them, but that does not make it okay to break the law in any way. The Godfather is a good movie to watch just for the fun of it, for good entertainment, or just because you like watching good movies to kill time, no pun intended.", "Why I like The Godfather": "People always ask me this question why do you like \"The Godfather\". I always tell them, you have to see it to know it.Vito Corleone the Godfathaer is fair, just. He smuggles gold but he won't deal in drugs and prostitution rackets because that's \"infamita\". He won't hesitate to kill a few Tattagilas because the world doesn't need them. He is angry with the establishment but that won't make him kill innocent people.The Godfather stays true to Mario Puzo's book. The dialogues are the same as well.What makes The Godfather special is that it's not a gangster film but a film about people who happen to be gangsters. At the end of the film you'd feel to take Coppola's hand and call him the Godfather.", "Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening": "Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.", "A brilliant classic!": "Francis Ford Coppolla has indeed done an excellent job of illustrating an Italian mafia family in the US, all the extremes they go through etc. The casting was also excellent and Marlon Brando/Al Pacino undoubtedly deserved the Oscars. The picturization was also well done, along with the background music. If you have read the book by Mario Puzzo, you will surely notice some change in the story towards the end. I suppose the change was to enable the production of Godfather II and III, which wereZ also good.", "Classic, never gets old vision": "Godfather is a groundbreaking and truly original piece of legendary film. With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment. Life like acting with emotive vibrations, grips you from the offset, with a compelling story that seems to get more intense and exciting as the film rolls on. This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic. Peace and Blessings", "Perfect beginning to trilogy": "I had heard about The Godfather trilogy for years and years, been told to watch it, and just never took the time. I wish i would have. I finally got down to watching the series last night and it has become my favorite movie trilogy of all time now. Everything about this movie is impeccable. The acting by Brando and Pacino is magnificent, and the storyline never lets up, constantly keeping you engulfed in whats going on within the Corleone family. Pacino does a magnificent job in particular, as he is the cool, calm and level-headed son of the Don in the first film, and he makes a transition between this film and Godfather 2 into the ruthless cold-hearted mob boss.", "A History of myself...not the 'Best Movie Ever' anymore": "This movie has a lot of history. I used to describe it as one of the best movies ever. This was when I still was a boy and mafia-movies were so exciting. Don't get me wrong, 'The Godfather' is still an amazing excitement to watch and if I have time I still do watch it. But with this movie it is as it is with so many things in life. Time shows that it is only a thing, or as it is in this case, a movie. Therefore I recommend to anybody who hasn't watched 'The Godfather' already: don't hesitate any longer. Watch it now! It is a beautiful story, great acting, and definitely a movie you won't forget. But for those who have seen this film, maybe many times already...don't discard it, I suppose it has become part of your own history. Enjoy talking about it, love watching it, and don't waste it by naming it the 'Best movie ever'.", "Masterpiece is an Understatement": "Francis Ford Coppola's legendary masterpiece about the Corleone Family is a must to every moviegoer. Although everybody knows it is considered one of the best films of all time, only watching can one understand the true power of this picture. Coppola succeeded in humanizing the mafia, in a way that his main character, the ruthless Vito Corleone, became one of the most beloved icons in movie history. Under his belt, Coppola had one of the best casts ever to appear together on screen. In the main role is the legendary Marlon Brando in what is probably his best performance ever. Alongside him you see the brilliant Al Pacino in his first major role, the amazing Robert Duvall and the great James Caan. The supporting cast also counts on Diane Keaton, John Cazale and Talia Shire. Thus begin the best movie franchise of all time. Sit back and watch this powerful film.", "The greatest epic of our time is told through the eyes of Coppola and Puzo.": "This is Coppola's crowning jewel, if not the 20th Century's. The story follows the legacy of the Corleone Family, one of the Five Families of New York in the 1940's. With accuracy in the time period and perfect accents, the cast of All Stars take over the screen with grace. A young Al Pacino heads the cast as an innocent and yet murderous Michael Corleone. Robert Duvall also gives the performance of his life as the Irish American Tom Hagen. And of course, Marlon Brando steals the scene as Don Corleone. The story tells a tale of family, trust, honor, and respect. Even though the characters are murderers and thieves, they are also fathers, sons, and husbands. This is a must-see for any movie goer. You have not seen American cinema until you have seen \"The Godfather.\"", "Criminals have a soft side.": "There's a bond that family members have between one another. It's something unexplainable. In most cases, they are there for you whenever you need them most. Maybe it's a loan you need help paying off. Maybe there is a boy at school that has been giving you a hard time, your big brother will be there right be your side. The movie \"The Godfather\" shows this bond between family members, but the movie shows it at it's most extreme. \tThe definition of a Godfather is \"a man that sponsors a person at baptism\". Another definition is \"to take under one's fostering care\". The slang term for \"Godfather\" is of course, \"the leader of and organized crime family\". It's amazing how this movie incorporates all three of those definitions.\tIn the very beginning of the film, the viewers are introduced to Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando. In the opening scenes, Vito Corleone is meeting with a man that tells him about how his daughter was beaten by some male \"friends\" of hers. This man asks for justice. He obviously wants revenge for what they did to his daughter. Vito grants him this request, it being his daughters wedding day, he cannot refuse any request. These people keep coming into his office,Wanting something from The Godfather, it being protection, revenge, fame or just giving their thanks to him and pledging their loyalty. They go to him because he can provide those things, and he can provide much more than the police could. The family had so much power. They had lawyers, journalists and all sorts of helpful people working on their side. People wanted to be a part of this family, but there was a very dangerous side to it all. \tThe acting in this film has to be the absolute best part. The casting could not have been done any better. Marlon Brando is the perfect Godfather. There is no other actor that could have pulled it off so well. Using the dental appliance to give him the bulldog look was genius. Brando was intimidating (as a mobster should be) but he somehow had a soft side that allows the audience to fall in love with the character, whether they think what he is doing is right or wrong. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is also a perfect fit. Is has an innocence about him yet at the same time he makes a seamless transition into a full blown criminal. \tThe dialog in this film is smooth and very believable. The story is intriguing and intricate, it is also very difficult to follow.The continuity in this film is also impeccable. The music in the movie seems repetitive. The same song is played all of the time, just different variations of it.\tI must say, the first time watching this film, it didn't impress me whatsoever. I thought it was overrated and I didn't understand what the big deal was. Then I decided to give it another chance and rent it. I'm not sure what was different about the second time watching it, but it totally changed my mind about it. So, if you are one of those people who think it is overrated, just give it another shot, you won't regret it. This movie is brilliant and is rightfully called one of the best.", "The Most Outstanding Achievement In Motion Picture of The 20th Century": "Steven Spielberg once said he considered retiring after watching The Godfather. Stanley Kubrick admitted The Godfather may very well be the greatest movie ever made and without a doubt has the best cast. If two of the greatest directors of all time had claimed such statement, what more needs to be said about this masterpiece, really? By now, it's already a stuff of legend. Countless lists and people have rated this as the finest motion picture to ever grace the silver screen. The genre and cinema itself have been heavily influenced by the contents in the movie, and even real-life mafias mimicked how Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in what I consider to be the most splendid acting job done by any actor or actress in any movie ever, carried himself. When did you ever hear something like that happened? If there was ever any? I doubt Francis Ford Coppola himself would have thought his first big directorial job would have given birth to an enduring legacy THIS big. Sure, he had Marlon Brando in his pocket, complete with Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, and Robert Duvall as future stars just to name a few, which must have been exciting for a young director for that time. But I still doubt Coppola would have known he was directing the greatest motion picture of the 20th century even once during the entire 62 days of shooting, even when he, the entire casts, and the entire crews gave it their all for those 62 days. But that magic was there. And it is now known throughout the world as The Godfather.I think the story is rather famous now, but I'll say it anyway. It tells the story of an organized crime family after the World War II was over. Spanning over 10 years, the movie was a journey of the youngest son (played brilliantly by the legendary Al Pacino) transformed from a war hero not wanting to have anything to do with his family's business to become the next head of an organized crime dynasty.It featured brilliant performances from every single person involved, especially the mythical Marlon Brando. Every scene he was in, no way you didn't have your eyes on him. Even when he wasn't around, you would still feel his presence and power. His character, to me at least, made this movie. No one could play him as grand as Marlon Brando did.On technical aspect, this movie is flawless. Coppola's directing really captured the quintessence of every character in the movie. The dark photography added to the whole mystique of every scene in this movie. And the last but definitely not the least, the score is magical.What else is there need to be said about this masterpiece? Only a few movie can be called perfection, The Godfather is a prime example of it. Everything in this movie is so unbelievably perfect it is almost unreal. How come something became this great is hard to decipher. This timeless classic is a definite must see for anyone. And among many movies made in the 20th century I have seen, this is the best of the best. The finest of the finest. Maybe several movies can come close, but I don't think anything can top this. I firmly believe The Godfather is without a doubt the most brilliant motion picture of the 20th century.", "One of the Best": "Movie maybe old and Black'n White but it's a Real gem. Strongly recommend everyone to watch.", "It really is \"The Best Movie Ever Made\"": "I just recently got into this movie this year. I've never been able to sit down and pay attention for 3 hours. But when I finally did, OMG I'm mad at myself for not giving it a chance. Like another reviewer said, you see something new every time you watch it. I could watch this movie every day. I appreciate the snapshot into a world that I will never live in. The plot is rich and all of the characters are very well developed.Michael Corleone actually haunts my thoughts sometimes. I felt genuine fear on the scene at the end where he talks to Carlo, just before \"sending him to Vegas\".Marlon Brandon showed us that Vito Corleone, as ruthless as he is, was very human and vulnerable. I think my favorite part is when he dies. There is no more awesome way to go...enjoying your twilight years playing with the grandbaby. His death had nothing to do with mafia life. He just passes from natural causes like a regular human being.I could say so much more but I dont want this to be a long review. I've heard for years the The Godfather was \"the best movie ever made\" and I have to agree. I rarely give a movie a perfect 10, but this one is genius on every level.", "Perhaps the Greatest Movie Ever Made!": "This film is absolutely Brilliant in EVERY respect!! Characterization, Story, Plot, Script, Cinematography, Acting. The Godfather is a True cinematic Masterpiece. Bravo!If there are any holes, weaknesses or inconsistencies, I have yet to discover them. I've watched it at least 8-10 times and it blows me away every single viewing. GF2 was excellent, but not nearly as tightly written, several holes in the story that simply don't add it, but still a great film in it's own right. GF3 - very underrated indeed.", "Best Film in the Past, present, and Future.": "this film, is the best film I ever seen out of hundreds of movies. every other month I feel that I need to watch the first part or the second part of the series of the God father again and again. Which they are the best. even they were considered 70s but they still one of the best movies have ever produced and have been filmed to the humanity ! story of power and energy, family, reality of American History. also no one can ignore the music and themes of this films that takes to different world or different planet. the Italian accent also is adding a lot of art to the movie picture. with one word describing this film it is a story of dreams life !", "A film you will not be able to refuse...": "Elegant crime and respected Italian leaders is the best setting for a Mafia. The Godfather is truly a great movie. When I saw it I felt identified even though I have nothing to do with any mafia. The main point of this film is how Michael Corleone inherits the work of his father, Vito Corleone. This movie touched my emotions. It is greatly directed by my friend the great Francis Ford Copolla, greatly written by my dearest Mario Puzzo and PERFECTLY ACTED by my masters Marlo Brando and Al Pacino. It is not by coincidence that this is ranked Top 1 in the IMDb list. The character of MArlo Brando is the perfect character a film like this should have: an old wise man who knows whats good and bad for his business, who even though leads a huge criminal bloody almost gore mafia, has a soul of his own that manages to love his family.The Godfather is truly one of my favourite films, highly over-passing all the modern day high-tech criminal movies. The point that sets this whole story in motion is that it is not about crime, but about business, not clean but big business. And then comes Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, a humble little man whose life is happy and truthful. He's loyal to his country and opposes to work for his father and brother Sonny. Al Pacino, due to his usually expression-less face during The Godfather, shows he's was meant to be the one to inherit the \"familia\".The music is probably the memory that will remain longer from this movie in my mind. The famous waltz, and the famous theme used many times in the scenes of Scisilly. Try to never hear this songs until you see the movie and it will cause to even the bravest hearts some bit of emotion (which is hard to accomplish).Last but not least, Francis Ford Copolla direction is probably his best. He includes beautiful settings in Corleone, beautiful enegeryfull angles in the wedding scenes, some great camera movement, great timing so it is not too slow or too fast. Francis Ford Copolla is certainly one of the best directors and it is shown in this film. The Godfather is a classic which movie lovers cannot die without seeing. If you don't like it (something that I've never heard as a reaction to this film)you better begin question yourself.", "Perfect.": "This is the closest film of being perfect out of all of the films. Great story and a fantastic directing, on top of that an amazing cast. This film never disappoints anybody. A true masterpiece that captivates the viewer.", "Immersive, but as much about the 1950's as 'Happy Days'": "1. Haircuts completely wrong in that 1970's manner. James Caan, for example.2. Clothes ditto.3. Nothing personal, but Brando was a ham.4. Al Pacino simply does not have the physical presence, at least not then. In the 'gangster' suits and hats he looks ridiculous, not important or scary.4. Extravagant son-et-lumieres do not an epic make.5. For its time, The Godfather was a refreshing change from the regular fare of 1972 with some good catchphrases, that's all.6. Greater than the sum of its parts because it's lush, visually and musically; but actually there's not much holding the set pieces together.", "Sum of all wisdom ~ Godfather!": "Godfather is my all time favorite movie.Basically,I don't watch a movie more than once but i have watched Godfather more than 10 times and i didn't get bored because every time i watch it,i find a new interesting thing!The movie talks about family,friends,health,business,power and poltics.My most favorite line in the movie is,\"Make him an offer,he cant refuse\".There is a life in Godfather movie and you have to learn the rules of the life in order to be successful.If you haven't watched the movie yet,without a second thought,go and watch it! Interstingly i have found a better platform for movie buffs like me through www.flickstree.com,in which one can stream,write and also rate a movie and it is highly recommended", "Old yet Gold": "There is a reason this is universally appraised as one of the greatest films of all time. Because it is. The story of Michael growing into the man of the family following Vito Corleones attempted assassination is entrancing and keeps viewers engaged throughout the course of the film. Although the pace is incredibly slow as most scenes are dialogue heavy, I believe it works with the film to create a story more about characters rather than one about fighting and explosions. Some people may not be able to sit through slow films like these, but those of you who are, will enjoy this film with all your heart.", "Best Best Best Movie ever": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life I love this movie and all of the GF movies I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly) This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.", "Coppola has created a masterpiece": "Mario Puzo's novel about crime, corruption, family and loyalty comes to life with the help of Francis Ford Coppola in The Godfather. The Corleone family, headed by the aging Vito Corleone, is the most powerful family on the East coast, and possibly all of America. They \"own\" senators, judges and policemen. They are above the law. Vito's son, Michael, has just returned from the war a hero, and wants no part in the family business. But when an up and coming rival family wanting to get into the drug trade asks the Corleones for protection, Don Vito declines their offer, sticking to his traditional Sicilian values. The other families aren't as concerned about the old ways and want in, but know that they can't do business without the Corleones' influence. So, they have Don Corleone shot, expecting to gain leverage with the Don out of action. Luckily, the Don survives and Michael, furious with the attempt on his father's life, steps up to take out the opposition.Soon, Michael, originally wanting nothing to do with the family business, proves himself to be quite a strategist, always playing mind games with everyone. Everyone except his father, of course. Michael slowly crawls up the ladder of power, destroying anyone who gets in his way, until he sits comfortably at the top. Ruthlessness is his tool and he wields it well. Only those inside the family and his small circle of long term friends are safe from his wrath.Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is magnificent. Brando portrays him perfectly as the tough and feared old patriarch that, although brutal to his enemies, loves and cares for his family. His raspy whisper and deliberate movements will forever echo in film history (already having been parodied and imitated countless times).Al Pacino's Michael Corleone makes a very gradual transformation from the respectable war hero with a nice girlfriend to a full-fledged criminal mastermind. At the beginning of the film, Michael is a friendly young man who wants no part in his father's world. In the very last scene, he is a dangerous, cold-blooded sociopath who still cares for his family, but will do anything to further his influence. Pacino gives a career-making performance and fits perfectly into the role of brilliant anti-hero (as well as the roles of Tony Montana in Scarface and Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon that would come later in his career).Francis Ford Coppola's directing is perfect. The dark, dramatic lighting used inside the Don's office is a trademark of foreboding danger and power. Everything from the gruesome and, sometimes, disturbing execution killings to the way Vito Corleone looks at his son, Michael, adds to the intoxicating blend of brutality and love that Coppola serves his audience.Nino Rota's score only spices up the brew with his traditional Italian-sounding pieces that conjure up images of tough Sicilian men riding horse-back through rugged terrain in the old country. A beautiful soundtrack to an already beautiful film.The Godfather is about how the human mind is affected by crisis, opportunity and corruption. Michael Corleone does not involve himself in the family business until they go after his father. This proves to be the catalyst. Michael takes the plunge into the underworld and, upon realizing that he is smarter than all of the other families put together, only goes deeper. He plays the game of crime like chess. He plans his moves and has all the angles covered. He strikes swiftly and without mercy. Michael Corleone is a criminal, but he is very different from the goon knocking over a 7-11 with a pen-knife. Coppola has created a masterpiece.", "An Unforgettable Masterpiece !!!": "Probably the best Motion Picture of all Time.What else can I say. I have read the novel and that was really great too, Francis Ford Coppola was really good in editing from the book to the screen. The Acting and the Screenplay was amazing which are probably the most important thing in movies. Nino Rota's Musical score was awesome it fitted in so well with each scene and brought it the right feeling to it. The story moved from one emotion to another in such a perfect way, you will find Suspense and Passion Power and Hatred in a way that will change the way you watch movies.The Godfather Part II was as good as this one. There is no other Motion Picture that takes you in an unforgettable story of Crime, Love, Hate and Power like The Godfather.", "Historical movie !!": "Flawless.. and one of the greatest films ever made", "hi": "This is a great movie.

Every time I view this film I still find something to marvel at... something that I had missed on previous viewings. I too, believe that this is a flawless film. On one viewing,  I was struck by the use of lighting in the film, how contrasting the lighting was. The use of light and dark, so beautifully used throughout the film, to me, symbolised the light and dark of these characters, and the world in which they lived. I love the portrayals of Mario Puzo's characters... Marlon Brando was superb.I loved watching Michael Corleone change from a naive young war-hero to a ruthless mafia godfather. I loved each of the characters in this film. That is one of the things that I like best about this film... that these ruthless men worked their way into my heart, casting away any judgement I would usually hold against people who do the hideous crimes that these men saw as merely work and necessary protection for their beloved family. I love their self-righteousness and even their lack of conscience. I am passionate about this film ... every damn aspect of it!!!", "One of the best movies ever seen!": "Godfather was truly magnificient in all aspects..Marlon Brando was simply superb, his most touching dialogue 'Keep your friends close and enemies closer' still echoes into my ears when I come across the name Godfather! Not forgetting Al Pacino, who played Brando's son, was just too good to watch..All in all, a GREAT CRIME MOVIE EVER!!!", "Bad": "Bad movie In The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppla is either a bad director or a hypocrite. The audience cheers for the Corleones, despite all Coppola points to to try to prove he disapproves of the mafia. Can Al Pacino portray an ordinary American? Brando nearly sinks Part I with his Hey! Look at me! Performance. He was never an ensemble actor.", "great english movie": "Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.", "Why this is the best Mafia movie ever": "Coppola's intense films are the stuff of legend and the sweeping drama of the Corleone family that was begun in this film is no exception.  The script is well written by Coppola and Puzo, who wrote the book, the acting is superb, and the little things like the lighting and the music add to the intensity and the drama of this film.  Al Pacino in pretty much his first role is superb as the straight war hero son of the Corleone Family who gets drawn into the \"business\" when his father is attacked.  Brando and Caan as well as Robert Duvall also deliver great performances.  The scene that sticks with you like the Baptism when Michael is having his enemies killed and its flashing back and forth between murders and the Catholic Baptism in Latin owing to the pre Vatican II setting is superb.  An excellent film well deserving of being ranked 3rd all time by the AFI.  The lighting is a superbly done job of being dark but light illuminating certain things much like a painting from the Dutch Master Rembrandt. All due respect to Blake Edwards but this movie is a \"10\"", "Sets the standard for family dramas!": "This is a movie where everything seemed to come together. Great cast. Film score on point. The sets are very well done. The story is compelling. A truly iconic film!", "The Cream Of All Mobster Movies": "\"The Godfather\" is, in my opinion, the best gangster movie ever created.  I like this movie for its superior directing and excellent storytelling.  This movie shows us that even gangsters are born human beings. They face victory and defeat about as much as any other group of people.  Despite its graphic intensity, I found myself paying very close attention to the emotions of the main family.  I'd say that it is a step above \"The Untouchables\".  Anyone interested in major film classics should see the original \"Godfather\" at least one time.", "Not a masterpiece": "This movie is one of the most famous in the history of cinema, but I can't see the reasons. It's true that Marlon Brando plays like a god and that Al Pacino begins to show why he is one of the best living actors... but there are too many dialogues that choke the breath of the movie. There are also some \"holes\" in the screenplay: for instance, why do we see one of the Godfather's sons (Al Pacino) first like a shy guy and then like a determined and blood-thirsty beast? Only because they killed his sicilian wife that he forgets soon to marry another girl? The direction of Coppola is flat: I don't like the way he just throws away the \"crescendo\" of some thrilling scenes and the way he doesn't emphasized the story. Besides after some killings we get to know their ways, so the last killings are \"phoned\"... we exactly know what is going to happen and so the surprise goes wasted. Only in the final Coppola succeeds in finding a beautiful alternated editing where he shows the deep contradictions of the members of the Mafia: Michael Corleone is in a Church where he swears to renounce the Devil and in the meanwhile his men are making a massacre. So: a good film but not a masterpiece as many people think.", "BEST FILM EVER": "Timeless! A masterpiece of cinematography, that encompasses almost all branches of human sentiment in real life situations.\nThis is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.", "I do not to go on and on. We all know it's an over fabulous film SPOILERS": "I am glad to see that it is still #1 on the IMBb.  I just watched \"The Godfather Saga: A Novel for Television\" on American Movie Classics.  It was great except it had to be edited for telivision.  I have just looked up that that theres a \"Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980\" which features ALL THREE films re-edited.  I shall sure want to see that some time.  If you have seen all three films you should surely try to catch the program I just saw on a movie or even network channel and see a very good deal of cut scenes, or better yet you should see the one I just looked up which I have not seen, but surely will.\nThe first time, unfortunately, I saw this film was not a very good experience.  I got tired and fell asleep during the half-hour or so. Except I didn't sleep, I struggled to stay awake which is just aggravating.  This, of course, is not the film's fault.  It had been a normal hectic day.  I tried to watch the entire film again the next day, but I found I couldn't get it all in because I had priorities the next day, so I just watched some of the stuff I had struggled with.  I still hadn't gotten any emotion of opinion, really of the film, except for the good directing.\nFinally, probably over two months later, I rented it from my local library along with the second one.  I watched the whole thing straight through and neadless to say, I was amased.  From the great opening scene where Abandando tells of the justice he wants for revenge of what has happened to his daughter to the Sicilian wedding, I was witnessing film greatness.  At the beginning of the film, you know that this is a powerful empire and that the ruler is wiser then ever.  You get glimpses pf the inside aggresiveness. When Sonny goes and finds that the FBI is monitering he he spits down and wrcks apart one of their cameras.  Then out the shake of keeping it together, throws money for the camera at the ground.  What goes on in that office while the wedding preseeds is some of the best diologue put on film. Any two year old who has watched movies or telivision woulld know \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" several years before the film is witnessed.\nWith Jack Waltz, a brutal Sicilian way is performed when he finds the gift of his six-hundred thousand dollar horses head in his bed.  Then there's the rejection of Sollozo's narcotics when Luca Brasi is stabbed throught the hand and strangled.  Later a Sicilian message is given of his bullet proof vest with two fishes in it.\nIt is obvious that Michael Corleone is having a splendind life.  He's a World War Two hero and he has a girl.  So, it could very well be wondered why did he decide to be the one to do the hits with the upmost volunatry. Because of his compassion for his family who ha had wanted no part of as far as business.  Indeed the job is done nervously, but thoroughly even with only one bullet for Solozzo and waiting a few seconds instead of dong so right when he cam eout like he was instructed to.  When The Don here's news of his beloved son's job, he is disturbed for he truly didn't want him in the business despite \"plans\" he may ahve had for him.\nIn Sicily, Michael finds new romance with Appolonia.  He marries her and soon finds himself in danger.  Appolonia is killed by a car bomb planted from Michaels own trusted Fabrisio (A reason wht you should see one of those sagas).  In America, Don Corleone's daughter connie is in jeapordy with her husband.  This jeapordy is the link the enemies use to trigger Sonny.  In one of the most absolutely brilliant scenes ever, he goes to the tollbooth. He notices that the car infront of him is clutching.  As the tendant reaches over to give him his change, he drops it and reaches down as the window shuts.  A line of hitmen with Thompsons then appear in a booth and two others come out of the clutching car.  They burst fire into the car and Sonny is swarmed with bullets.  He makes his way out of the car where he is swambed more.  He lets out a yell.  The firing stops for second.  Then the firing continues untill they fianally stop and one of the men kicks him in the head and they go off leaving the dead Sonny with bunches and bunches and bunches of bullets in him.  It is a fabolously directed scene.  Then there's the aftermath of Vito's \"Look how they massacred my boy.\"  This with the favor being returned from the opening scene where the favor is actually sorrowfully doing the best he can to make Sonny look better.\nWhen Michael returns from Sicily, he takes over as don.  After awhile he goes to Kay and marries her telling her \"His way of things is done.  Even he knows that.  In five years the corlenone family will be completely legitamate.\"  In Las Vegas, Fredo has a job for the big-shot Mow Green. When Michael wants to buy his hotel out, Moe refuses with insult and threat. Wehn Fredo critisises his brother for his conduct, Michael responds with \"Fredo you're my brother and I love you, but don't ever take side with anyone against the family again.  Ever.\"  This lives out.  Before Vito dies, he tells Michael that the one who comes with the meeting is the traitor. He also expresses his regret for his son's position.  \"I never wanted this for you.\"  \"You could have been Senator Corleone.  Governor Corleone. Something.\"  The Don dies playing with his grandson.\nAt the funeral, who should be the informastion deliverer for the meeting, but Sal Tessio.  While Michael stands as godfather for Connie and Carlo's baby, he orders the hits of the five families.  The sequence has very elegant cuts of preparation and preseeding while interceeding with the holy ceromony.  Clamenza does his work at an elevator, firing two shots with a rifle while others take scare of their prey by locing in a revolving door, busting in and spraying the bed with Thompsons, coming ans shooting in an eye through glasses, and shooting at the bottom of exterior stairs of a building.  When the ceromony is over, Michael goes to Carlo's house and snags for a confesion for Sonny while assuring that his life will be spared. He then goes into a car where Clamenza is in a the backseat with a \"Hello Carlo.\"  He then stragles him with him struggling, moving his legs up, breaking through the winsheild as the cars goes forth.  It's as well as everything else in the film, very greatly directed as the shoe gets to the camera.  Then Connie rushes in with her terror and recenment for Michael's action.  When Connie is taken away Kay asks about wether it's true.  After a few entences Michael breaks through with \"ENOUGH!\"  Then he calms and says. \"All right.  This one time you can ask me about my affairs.\"  When she quietly asks \"Is it true?\"  Michael casually responds softly \"No.\"  Then there's the great close of Michael being kissed as royalty and Kay watching with the door shuting in front of her, closing her out.\nThis film is fabulous and worthy of it's praise.  It's one ofthe few films that is very popolar, but very few people critisize it despite anything. Story, acting, directing, cinemotatography, art/set direction, everything. I have not seen Cavalada, but I am most petrifide that Francis Ford Coppola didn't get the oscar for best dierector.  This is an incredible classic about crime and life that must be seen.  It will always remain, as long as film, a fabulous film.", "Proof that we're spoiled by MTV...": "... when so many people complain about an all-time classic like \"The Godfather\" being too long and slow.  I'm a firm believer that a movie needs to be as long as the story allows; we don't need to make a SNL skit into a 90-minute movie, and we don't need to cut a novelized classic down to placate the dwindling attention span of the audience.  What scenes would you cut, honestly?  What is not needed in this movie?  Would you shorten the long shot of Michael as he admits that the Turk needs to be killed?  Maybe cut out the Don's death scene, as it obviously slows down the movie? Honestly, I don't understand it...", "A film like no other, not even Part II comes close!": "A film better then anything Hollywood has ever produced. The critics adore Citizen Kane (a good film, undoubtably) but it doesn't have the deep qualities of the Godfather, it is a one man show (which can be good, Taxi Driver, but still...) but in the Godfather the star, Brando, I feel is a supporting character. Excellent as he is in the role, he still doesn't match the pace and glory of the next generation of Mafia hoods he is tutoring as the role of Don Corleone. The true gem of the bunch is obviously Pacino who controls the screen with a performance that he has never bettered in the 28 years since, but don't forget the arrogant Sonny (James Caan), the in control Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and my personal favorite, the runt of the litter Fredo, expertly executed by the late John Cazale.All in all a story of love, power and above all, family.", "A movie you cannot refuse!": "With many classic moments, amazing performances, a gripping narrative, as well as incredibly assured direction by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is truly unmissable. Any self respecting film fan who has not seen this film should rectify that without delay.", "The Godfather Series": "What makes this movie so good?  Just about everything.  Good acting, good direction, good story, good development...it's weird, but this is one of those cases where the sequel makes it better.  Godfather II is the best sequel ever made, and I just don't think you can really say anything about this movie until you've seen that one.  Really, you have to look at the first one as the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and the second as his fall.  Despite the fact that he doesn't lose power, he loses almost everything else.  You don't really get much character development of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in this movie, because it's all being saved for the sequel (in the form of Robert De Niro).  The way that the two are intertwined is just absolutely brilliant. As a movie by itself, The Godfather is still a masterpiece.  One of the things that I think makes it so compelling is the blurring of the line between good and evil.  Just about everyone in this movie is a bad guy. But there are good bad guys and bad bad guys, and we're on the outside trying to decide which ones we want to root for.  We end up cheering on the Corleones, the focal point of the movie, but it's very reluctant as the climactic scene unfolds.  I found myself right there with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the end, torn between what I know to be right and what has to be done for survival. I cannot imagine this movie being any better.  It's fascinating, and the sequel does not do anything to diminish that sense of awe.  It's a timeless classic about the battle between good and evil.  But does evil really win out?  It's impossible to tell.", "Hi": "This film is very beautiful and all the actors were wonderful", "Best movie of my lifetime!!!": "My all-time favorite movie.

Although some might be scared to see the length of the movie, but every minute is worth watching. you never feel bored; not for a second. On the other hand you enjoy every second of it. The Al pacino part doesnt really come out in this part. this one is more of a Marlon Brando show.

The ending were the least suspected son gets 'Don\" is really astounding and reminiscent. The suspense shown was also extremely on point, when Micheal's newly married Italian women gets killed you don't know what to think. After when he returns it puts a strain on the viewers when Vito is seen to be supporting his son being 'Don' but you can tell that he does not like that deep inside of himself. Impressive acting made the movie really stand out and the ending would make you sit there and think... is there going to be another godfather or not? I rate this movie 10/10 because of all those reasons.", "Simply the best...": "I can't say enough about this film. It is simply the best example of what can be achieved through the art of cinema.

What makes this movie the classic that it is is the \"life\" brought to the screen by this group of fine actors.  After seeing the film, I don't think that anyone could imagine Don Vito Corleone being played by anyone other than Marlon Brando, who is possibly the greatest actor in film history.  Same with Al Pacino in the role on Michael.  The cold hearted and hot headed bastard that is Michael could not have been portrayed better by any other actor.  James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan....these men were born to play these parts.  Even Talia Shire, who I really don't care for much as an actress, delivers one hell of a stellar performance.  Diane Keaton, too.  It's performances like these that you only see once in a lifetime.  These actors and actresses create real lives for Mario Puzo's characters, each with such distinct personality that after watching the film, I refer to the characters by their first names, almost as if I know them.  The characters are portrayed so well that one could create a mock situation in ones head and accurately determine how a specific character would respond to it.

Nothing compares to the story line of this film.  The length of the film is well worth it.  You are not bored for one second.

Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are superb in this epic!", "A Good Movie, Even For This CGI'd Up Generation": "I am 15 at the time of writing this review, and all the movies I have watched made before 1980 I didn't enjoy. It probably wasn't the films' fault; it's just I'm used to movies with realistic CGI effects, HD quality and current actors, but nonetheless I often found the films' quality too grainy to bear and the effects too cheap to appreciate. It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather. First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn't recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot. In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies. It's the best start to a trilogy that I've ever seen!", "Very favorable": "One of the greatest films made.  I can watch it over and over and not tire. Great acting, story and screenplay - directing is top-notch!  One of the few movies that sequel versions were as good if not better than the original. Especially since most of the key actors continued on through all three movies.  That's commitment!", "Insanely Good.": "This is my personal favorite movie of all time. It's just perfect. I actually hate to give it 10 stars (because there's no such thing as perfect), but I haven't a choice. It's just perfect. If you hate this movie...well, then, that's fine. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. The settings are amazing, as are the camera angles, and the acting has no spots. The only thing imperfect about this movie is the character Santino. I just hate him. I'm glad he died. Critic's Star Amount: 4 (out of 4) Stars My Rating: 4 (out of 4) Stars You should watch it. It's just perfect. THere are few movies that can even compare to this. I just suggest this...if you only like the film because of the bloody scenes, then you should watch Pulp Fiction.", "One of the best films I have seen": "What can I say about this masterpiece. Few words can describe The Godfather. This film is an excellent adaptation of the best seller novel. I have read the book and seen the film. I loved both, though the book is better since it gives more insight into the Italian mafia. But the movie is great.I love crime dramas and gangster films. The Godfather was very well crafted. I come from India and many film directors love this film. In 2005 an Indian filmmaker made \"Sarkar\" which is inspired from The Godfather. Sarkar was good but nothing beats The Godfather. It is magnificent and hugely entertaining. No one can beat Mr.Francis Ford Coppola's version.When it comes to the performances everyone do a great job. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the best in the film. Their performances have and will always inspire upcoming actors anywhere in the world. They live their characters as no one else. It is sad that Pacino never won an Oscar for any of The Godfather films. James Caan and Richard Castellino are very good as Sonny and Clemenza respectively.All in all, this is a worldwide film, not to be missed by any person who loves good cinema. This will remain one of my favorites.", "Brilliant, but not the 'greatest movie ever made'": "The Godfather has been timelessly voted the best movie ever, over and over and over again, but its not!!!! However, do not let this opinionated view fool you, it is a fantastic film with nothing wrong with it. This films ranks up with the other most over rated films in existence, such as Star wars: a new hope and Apocalypse now.The films starts off at a wedding, the daughter of the infamous 'Godfather' is getting married, and we soon find out that on this day of all days, no father can refuse a request. More subplots follow and some interesting dialog is put forward, until the Godfather is gunned down by a rival family. However, he does not die but is in injured, along the way his son dies, and the son of the man who tried to kill him dies. The Godfathers youngest son Michael has to flee the country as he is the one who killed the rival family members son, The godfather is upset as he wanted Michael to be the legitimate member of the family. The plot goes by and Michael returns, and along with the Godfather they kill all the head members of the leading rival families. This is not the best plot summary in the world but it will do.The film is flawless, as many people constantly state. The acting is great, although Brando should not have won a best actor Oscar? All the other 3 should not have even been nominated for best supporting actors and actresses. But besides this, the give great performances. The script is where most of the talents truly lie, a brilliant story of the Mafia and how it operates, filled with loyalty and betrail this is a film which takes you on an intense and emotional ride. But this film is very very boring in some places, for instance when Michael is hiding out in Italy. Now im no shallow person who has to have action and explosions in movies to feel satisfied, but for a film to be crowned the greatest ever you have to love every bit of the film completely, and everyone will admit there are very boring bits in this. However still a great film. In my opinion, if you really want to a crown a film the best ever, you should look to titles such as Terminator 2, Shawshank Redemption, Master and Commander: The far side of the world, Lord of the rings trilogy", "One of the best movies of all time": "Its really hard to describe, but this movie is just wow. I would suggest everyone to watch it. Honestly i wish they still made moves like this, because this goes in the \"unforgetable\" category.", "The Ultimate Perfection.": "\"The Godfather\" is the perfect film. The 1970s was the greatest decade in the history of motion pictures for turning out masterpieces. Above all else, what captures the viewers in this movie--arguably the decade's premier masterpiece--is the stark dichotomy of family bonds versus terrible betrayal. \"The Godfather\" causes viewers to be enthralled by the harshest possible realization of moral relativism that could possibly be imagined. But admittedly, it is our connection to and fascination with the Corleone family--every bit as dysfunctional, violent, and disturbing as one would picture an organized crime family to be--that makes this film only more beloved and respected as the years pass on. For example, when fans of the film discuss what they love about the movie, the expected level of disturbing violence in it is rarely mentioned as being remarkable. What fans remember most is the great writing and the spectacular performances. Fans are thrilled to see a dark side of American life from a distance and that very few people ever see all while they root for their beloved Corleones. \"The Godfather\" has stood the test of time, and it always will.", "Art": "There is no other crime movie that comes even close to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather.

Robert Duvall was already well-known, and this cinched him.  James Caan - one of my favourites -and this showed me why - again.

Dishonour his family (who are massacred along the way) and surrender, or fight back and take over for good.Coppola's films might not have the same drive of their narrative most films have, but what they make up for is some of the best and most simple cinematography, great characters and great acting, and for an all star-lineup... well.", "Boring, slow, way overated": "if you think that a dude mumbling with cotton stuffed in his cheeks is the hieght of great acting, this is the movie for you. this had got to be the most overated movie in the history of movies. i mean, its way too long and stretched out. boring! theres nothing here that hasnt been done better in a TV movie of the week which won't take three miserable hours of your life to do it, too. i know this has a real reputation as the best movie ever made or whatever, but i don't like to be able to drive a truck through the pauses and stretched out diologue. the truth? this is a movie for people who think that long long movies that are so dim you can't even hardly see anything are the hieght of art. -----", "A Masterpiece of Cinema Fifty years young =)": "I won't go into an in depth review of all the characters and plot lines etc. I'll keep it simple with just my immediate thoughts.Spanning ten years from '45 through to '55 in post war America/Italy, The Godfather is a stunning masterpiece crime drama film and it's easy to see why it has cemented itself in the hearts of film buffs both young and old.The centralization of the film is the Corleone family members and Coppola's direction is razor sharp. The entire film is masterfully shot from start to finish, death scenes are hard hitting and very impactful but never overdone. Acting and dialogue is superb from everybody. Brando's lines are a little hard to understand at times but he perfectly captures the image of an ageing Mafia boss.Clocking in at almost three hours, it's a slow paced film but very engaging throughout. I enjoyed it so much it didn't feel like it was that long of a film. It feels like two hours, not three.The 4K restoration makes this movie look truly fantastic. It looks like it's a movie made in the early 90's not the early 70's. I picked up the 50th anniversary box set in 4K and can't wait to watch Part 2 and Coda (Part 3). So great to have the full set of these three legendary films on the best format available.", "A classic piece of movie making history.....": "Probably the greatest film of all time. This is a tremendous landmark in future film making. The acting is of the highest quality and helps you to mould into the esencse of the story. A very carefully and sensibly ploted film which is gripping, touching and frightening from start to end, especially in the penultimate scene where the baby is being cristened and the Corleone family kills off some of the main crime heads in New York. A must see.", "The Greatest Film Ever": "For me the godfather is not just a movie it's a school of life you can learn how to live just after watchin it", "An offer he can't refuse": "The Godfather is beautifully crafted and definitely one of the best films ever made. Even the slight detailing you may miss such as the oranges implying something bad will happen to Vito Corleone. The transformation of Michael Corleone and the acting by Al Pacino is exceptionally brilliant. Tom Hagen is an excellent lawyer and friend to the Corleone family and he plays a crucial role. The balance of Vito being the experienced, Sonny being the rash, Fredo being the idiot and Michael being the intelligent is very well done. The audience need to see the different angles of the family and this is portrayed phenomenally in The Godfather.", "Simply the greatest film ever made!!!!!!!!": "There really isn't much you can say about The Godfather because it is simply the best movie ever made and anyone who says otherwise knows nothing about films. The storyline is superb, the actors are excellent and the music is good too.  I thought Al Pacino should have gotten something for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. Funny how he never got a Golden Globe or Oscar for this part but yet it's that character that he is known for most. Francis Ford Coppola got this production perfect down to the smallest detail. This movie is truly a work of art and no other film has even come close to its stature. It is a triumph no other movie has been able to recreate! Everybody around the world must see this film at least once!", "This is one of my favorite movies ever.": "I always thought that the godfather was kind of boring until I watched it this past year. I never fully grasped the idea of the mob. Also I couldn't get past the first half hour. But once I did I went on to watch the second and then the third one too. This movie is filled with drama, action and gore. If you love gun action and movies with deception you'll love how things play out in this movie. There isn't any comedy in my opinion only great sayings that stick with you and great scenes. If you have ever seen \"you've got mail\" and the godfather you'll know that if your a guy it is essential to see this movie. If you don't see it, you will be missing out on the best movie of all time.", "Appreciating how good the movie is.": "If you are one of those film-goers who do not have a long attention span, are not able to digest more comlicated dialogue and only appreciate mindless action thrillers then this film is not for you.

The ageing don corleonie played eloquently by the late Marlon Brando refuses to enter into the narcotics trade following the end of ww2, following don Vito refusal this starts off a gang war between the 5 families of new york with the corleonies. The antagonist the barzini family and the tattalia family attemp to have don Vito character killed effectively castrating the corleones power. The attempt fails and Sonnie the dons eldest son takes control of the family while don Vito recovers meanwhile the dons youngest son Michael played by AL pacino agrees to kill the tattalia top narcotics distributor in a carefully orchestrated subterfuge at a peace negotiation. The death of the narcotic distributor escalates the war further leading to sonnies bloody execution at a toll booth one of the movies memorable scenes. Young Michael while in exile in Italy learns of his brothers misfortune and takes over following his fathers retirement, he vows revenge for his brothers murder. I will not give to much of the plot away but it is intriguing to see all the scheming and plotting by the mobsters.

It is one of the masterpieces of cinema world over. Many a director worldwide has paid tributes to this film in one way or the other. Twice in the recent history in India only (Sarkar and Raajneeti).Marlon Brando is amazing as the Godfather. Al Pacino (who was still making a stronghold in Hollywood at that time) has done justice as the son who is in conflict with his family business. His transformation, both by action and his psyche, is a treat to watch. The beauty of the film, and why it works at so many levels, lies in the fact that the characters' charisma is built not by their actions on screen but by a sense of intrigue that the writers and director have achieved by this flawless narrative.Add to that the cinematography of Gordon Willis. The lighting in the frames (and lack of it) adds to the sense of intrigue. The cutting is crisp and helps build the tension.Undoubtedly a 10/10", "stupid movie": "now i've seen stupid movies, but this one was the stupidest most pathetic movie i've ever seen.  i dont understand how people can like it.  too much violence. i recommend you dont waste your time watching this abomination.  i give this a -9 out of 10.", "amazing.": "After watching the Godfather, the first thing that came to mind was \"why haven't i seen this before? WHY?!\" despite being a lover of both classic and modern day films i was completely shocked with the fact that i didn't make more of an effort to watch this film and experience the brilliance of it earlier. the Godfather left me completely awe-struck and eager to watch the following sequels. The story had so much thought put into it, every scene, moment or event had a significant (and entertaining) importance to the film's momentum. in addition the capricious, unprecedented happenings during the film was enough to keep me awake after the clock stroked past 2am. people seem to question the realism of it all, but i find it very realistic and inspiring. despite all the unexpected occurrences in the film they all held a reason, they had substance that contributed to the crafting and shape of the film. all in all, it was a beautifully made film and the actors truly put on a great show. AMAZINGGG.", "Amazing in every way.": "I'm not sure exactly \"what\" makes this movie so great, so I'll just list the basics.The acting was great, although I don't know if I should say amazing, since I don't really know how the mafia in the 40s really act.The plot was amazing and not predictable at all. Although it's one of those movies where you really had to pay attention, or usually you have to watch it twice to understand everything that is going on. Even though it was 3 hours long, I didn't get bored at any point (which I find happens a lot with long movies).The soundtrack is unforgettable, the theme is very soothing and I find myself listening to it a lot. It was also very fitting with the movie.Cinematography and effects. The filming was decent. The movie kept a nice balance between dialogue and action scenes, and the action scenes were in very good taste (meaning they weren't \"over-done\" with gallons of fake blood and/ or over-exaggerated pain). All the death scenes were highly significant to the plot.Because of the dialogue/ action balance, this movie can appeal to anyone of all ages. This movie definitely makes my top 5.", "kutuktde": "undoubtebly the best movie ever and godfather part 2 is easily the second best and im sick of people saying part 3 is s*** its not that bad it easily should be in the top 50 movies ever . marlon brando by the way is easily the best actor ever without question his acting in on the waterfront ' the godfather, and apocalypse now was second to none. al pacino and robert deniro are the next best without question you only have to watch movies like dog day afternoon , scarface,taxi driver, raging bull,scent of a women ,heat, the deer hunter, not to mention their roles in the godfather", "If you haven't seen The Godfather before": ", the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film.", "The best adaptation ever": "While I'd probably rank \"Vertigo\" and \"Citizen Kane\" above it, I don't have any problem with \"The Godfather\" topping the list.A lot has been made of the gorgeously classical style that Coppola uses, and it's proof that a director doesn't have to break new ground or reinvent film grammar, a la \"Memento\" or \"Pulp Fiction\" (both of which I love), to be creative and inventive.The acting is brilliant, something that even the usually blind Oscars recognized, which caused a logjam in the Best Actor category.  My favorite performance is one that often goes unnoticed:  Robert Duvall's muted, pitch perfect Tom Hagen.Perhaps the most neglected aspect of the film is how brilliantly Coppola and Puzo adapted the novel.  If you read the book, you'll find that all the novel's strengths are on display upon the screen, while none of its weaknesses, or even interesting extraneous material, appear in the script. Since Coppola had recently written a great script for \"Patton,\" a notoriously difficult feat considering the subject matter, and Puzo went on to co-write the unfortunately hilarious \"Earthquake,\" I think most of the credit should probably go to Coppola.This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.", "Extraordinary movie": "It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and not get tired of seeing the movie repeatedly.

It just takes control over my mind.", "gold": "One of the best movies i have ever seen! 10 stars out of 10", "Cinematic perfection, why not 10/10?": "The Godfather is one of maybe 3 or 4 of those 'perfect movies'. The ones where no matter how many times you watch it, you can't nit-pick anything wrong, unnecessary, even if your life depended on it. It has an amazing story, incredible (and subtle) acting, great cast overall, and it is consistently gripping for the 3-hour run time. There is no trace of any laziness or mistake.So why shouldn't I give this a perfect rating while we're at it? Well, two reasons mainly.The first is universal: Despite it's Cinematic perfection, the way I see a perfect movie is if no one hated it. If ANY human being watched this movie from start to finish, they would be on the edge of their seat for 178 minutes (and I mean ANYONE who watched this, not one person left behind). It seems a little like splitting hairs if one person would lean back for a second and no longer calling this movie 'perfect', but when I hear that word, I expect people to mean what they say. And judging from the few hateful reviews I've seen on this one, it just doesn't quite make the cut.Second, I would be one of those people who happened to sit back for a portion of the movie, mostly after Don Vito came back from the gunshot scene. I was thrilled and angry at the same time, but seeing as how he went on with business as before, I figured it was a break in the movie for everyone to re-cap so far. Bottom line, I got lost a little after that.Again, if the Godfather were perfect, then it would have a prefect 10/10 overall rating as well, and not the 9.2 it currently has. Still, I recommend anyone who likes movies to watch this one. It will most likely be worth your while.", "Godfather must watch": "Normally it is said that when read a book you do not like the movie but it is being proved wrong by Godfather. This movie goes exactly what you must have imagined while reading the book. This is the only movie that has every thing in it drama, thriller, romance and action actually you can say this is made for all type of audience in the world. There was so many characters whom i did not like while reading the book but i loved it while watching the movie i saw it to late but if you have not seen it yet then you must watch it this will not waste your time instead you will learn a lot. This movie is the perfect example of film making.", "Action, Mafia and Don Corleone": "The godfather is a special movie.The Godfather is an instant classic, a masterpiece of the American Film industry and one of the greatest films that has ever been done. Like i said in the summary, this film contains action scenes that are brutal and everybody knows despite not yet having seen the godfather, because this film is excellent, so we already seen some of its scenes. I remember that before i see this brilliant film, i had already seen one of its greatest scenes in the Simpson's's. Well, i would just like to say to the ones who haven't seen this movie yet, that this is definitely one of the movies that we must see before we die. The Godfather brutal action scenes, an awesome story and a great great great performance by Marlon Brandon as Don Corleone. Don Corleone is one of my favorites characters of all time. is quotes are legendary. You must see the godfather. It's perfect", "Maybe a better Michael Corleone was in there": "I recently watched the Godfather again on DVD after many years - actually watched it twice. Obviously, this film is an icon in American pop-culture and there probably is nothing new to be said about it. But I will try to make a few fresh observations here. After the first viewing about a week ago, I thought, this movie is sloppier and more sprawling than I remembered. After the second viewing, I saw how all the pieces came together to redefine the Hollywood gangster movie. The sets, lighting, sound, dialogue and the entire atmosphere really draws the viewer into the past, even if the effect romanticizes gangster life. Most of the performers seemed to bring their best stuff to their roles. But, most of the main roles could have been fleshed-out more, in the script. For example, two of the main actors, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny, were very good and they could have carried more scenes. Also very good were some of the supporting actors like Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Sterling Hayden as McCluskey and especially Al Lettieri as Sollozzo. In fact, Lettieri was so compelling in his brief role as the criminal rival to the Corleone family that I wondered if he would have been better cast as the \"hero\" Michael Corleone. Which brings me to Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael: Of course Pacino is one the great actors ever, but he underplayed the role and made Michael so lacking in charm and charisma, that I found it hard, not only to like him, but to believe he could pull off the things he did, like controlling a powerful crime family or even marrying a beautiful native girl during his time in Sicily. I also found the portrayal of Tom Hagen a bit bland, probably more to do with the script than with the acting of Robert Duvall. Hagen was supposed to be an adopted family member, who was brought into the family as a boy and raised like a son and brother. Yet throughout the whole film, he never gets out of lawyer mode. Even actual lawyers frequently stop being a lawyer for a few minutes here and there. A few scenes were a bit superfluous, particularly those featuring Diane Keaton as Michael's fianc\u00e9 (maybe I'm just biased against Diane Keaton), but the Godfather is worth sitting through more than once.Disclaimer: I never read the book by Mario Puzo. This review only concerns the film itself, independent of the source material.", "One of the top movies": "A bit over-glorified as far as \"crime families\" are concerned, nevertheless, acting is top, cinematography is top, and it does have characteristics that made it part of modern Western culture. This movie has no flaws, even as far as its \"message\" is concerned.I do believe though that it's incomplete without \"part II\" (part III was an appendix). I'm a Mediterranean and I can understand \"why this and why that\", and an American can understand the \"why's\" by watching Part II, then watch Part I again. There are many shades of gray in the personalities of immigrants, especially the most ambitious of them. In the eyes of an American, Part I is a crime movie, but with Part II it also becomes a cultural movie, and the main focus switches from \"crime\" to something more cultural - integration and part of American history, through the story of an Italian family. Highly recommended to people who would read a book again, and would see a movie again.", "The best mafia movie ever": "Yeah. I don't think i have to write more than that actually. I think the most of you already know how good this movie is (or how good these movies are), and what the story is. It has so much emotion and is depicting that world so compelling, it's hard to explain it without spoilers. If you like crime movies, watch it. If you like drama, watch it. Do you like suspense and action? Watch it. Do you like music? Watch it. It's the kind of movie that has everything. The kind of movie that leaves you breathless, that you will never forget.

The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction to the acting, to the story-line, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did.

In this first part you see how a crime family runs their business and how the head of the crime family have to deal with lots of complications with other crime family's in new york, with the police, with his sons and daughter. Marlon Brando plays a very dark head of the crime family. Together with Al Pacino James Caan and Robert Duvall who also play awesome, Its a must to see if you like crime movies.

I never saw such a beautiful movie in my whole career in India.", "The best, unmatched realism and a wonderful work of art and entertainment": "this is probably the best film in the history of cinema, if not the best, then at least in the top 5. a film can be good for one of many reasons; good acting, good direction, writing, etc., good entertainment (simply fun to watch) or a brilliant artistic piece of work. the godfather contains all of these elements. the cast alone is a given that the acting will be brilliant, and as the cast suggests, it is. Brando reinvented himself, Pacino's screen legend was born and Duval and Caan are simply wonderful. the women are notable as well, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton. many others shine in smaller roles.the writing is clever and authentic (having the original author, Mario Puzo co-write the script added the realism), while Coppola added what he needed for it to be a successful movie. the direction is crisp and faced paced when it needs to be, the film feels real, most viewers can sympathize with these criminals/murderers as well as easily being able to engulf themselves into their world. the movie is entertaining and original. it is artistic, a great parable about family life and values, and containing an unexpected dose of morality, which serves as splendid irony. overall, this is probably the most well rounded movie of all time containing elements of everything one wishes a movie to contain. 10 out of 10, hands down.", "Brilliantly Haunting": "To begin with, I had not seen the Godfather, nor its subsequent sequels, until about two years ago. I have only one thing to say about this: Why? Why did I not see this sooner? Francis Ford Coppolla creates a brilliantly haunting masterpiece, full of drama, and perfectly sets the mood, entrancing you frame by frame into the world of legalized crime. Marlon Brando shines in quite possibly his greatest performance ever as the Don Vito Corleone. While he may not appear to be a truly menacing figure, as the viewer you instantly respect him with the way he carries himself and his words. Brando's range of emotions, the way every line he speaks is with conviction of a man who is so wise, truly defines the character that I'm not sure anyone originally thought could be so strong. The next main cast standout is Al Pacino, who gives here a staggering performance as Vito's youngest son, Michael. The transformation of his character is absolutely incredible, from the mild-mannered Captain in the United States Marine Corps, to the future and eventual Godfather of the Corleone Family. Pacino completely grasps his role and takes on an entirely different life himself, to the point where we forget he is an actor. The rest of the cast is extremely superb, all the way down to the most minute character. Perhaps the two most touching scenes are 1) When Michael visit's his father in the hospital after the attempted murder at the hands of the Tattaglia family, and 2) After James Caan's character, Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone, is albeit brutally shot numerous times, and Vito Corleone asks the mortuary to \"use all of his powers\" to fix his son, because he \"didn't want his mother to see him like this.\" This is truly a magnificent story, filled with betrayal, family loyalty, and eventual heartbreak. A marvelous masterpiece from both Copolla and Mario Puzo, who wrote the screenplay (and the later who wrote the novel). And to think that Paramount almost fired both Copolla and Pacino because they weren't the first choices! That would have been an insult! If that had happened, I would not be here, commenting on this movie, because it would not have been anywhere near as beautiful of a film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now! Don't wait another minute! If you have, watch it again. And again. And again.

It's a very serious movie which demands your attention at certain times. There's no action, no chills giving music rather jazz, no comedy just a serious movie about gangs and crime families that goes on for 3 hours. Not most people may like that but If you are more into dialogues and screenplay and can understand the true intensity and purpose of such films...you'll love it like I do. The actors don't feel the actors themselves at all , they feel the characters they are playing.

Gratzi.", "Any description is not enough": "Every character seems to be perfectly embedded, everyone has a specified reason to be in the plot and each one brings something substantial that makes us remember them. It is magnificent how the main characters show an ironic mix between honesty, respect, etc. and anger, betrayal and many other facets that makes us ask if they're good or bad people. Beyond a classification for the characters, you gonna love them as they are, and we can understand that there's more than just black and white. Definitely, a movie to watch, no matter how many years from his release, and no, I can't say that is a gangster movie, neither that is a Pacino's Movie, no no, It's more than that, The Godfather could be called for to many people like \"The Movie\".", "One scene of this movie and I have to see it all over again!": "This movies keeps surprising me.

Of course, I do tend to go against the majority somewhat.It's good enough, but I save higher praises for at least eighty other movies.", "The nearest thing to cinematic perfection yet.": "It's true! A visually beautiful film with a powerful story and amazingperformances.  How could it possibly be improved upon?", "Indeed a great start to one of the greatest trilogies ever!": "The Godfather is indeed a great start for the trilogy and a great movie alone. The thing that I admired most about this film is the extensive quality of story, you always know whats going on if you listen carefully. It's really dramatic without getting too dramatic which is the fine line between effective and ridiculous, and The Godfather balances on that line perfectly. Cinematography is a part of what gives this movie classic status, the camera work gives the Godfather a slightly sinister effect with the shadows which is more apparent in some scenes set at night.Performances are top notch from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and of course John Cazale. There much more great performances. The score of The Godfather is probably the best of all time. It helps the drama and settings. The Godfather's sets are really accurate for the time it is portraying and the Italian family environment. Overall this three hour crime family epic is great cinema that is only beaten by part two in my own personal opinion.", "A great \"family\" movie": "This movie gives the audience a look at what family really means.  \"The Godfather\" has the cast, writing, score, directing, and cinematography that makes great movies.  The story of the Corleone family is one that endures. It is less about crime and more about the trials of any normal family.  It casts light on the hypocrisy of the establishment through showing society its own dark underbelly.  The thought that a mafia don is no different than a Senator or President (Kay and Michael's discussion after Michael returns from Sicily and tells Kay he is running the family business), shows how naive society can be and how quick it is to offer blame on people who believe in something as opposed to nothing.  All in all one of the Ten Best movies of all time.", "The drama that portrays some of the history of the 20th century in America": "Many words have been written about \"The Godfather\" since debut in 1972 and no doubt that all words are quite flattering, but always worth a few cents more about this great movie. The work, directed by then newcomer director Coppola, was awarded in the launch year and continued to receiving well-deserved awards, until soon became a landmark of international cinema . With substantial actors and flawless performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the story has traces of a true work of art. Its soundtrack also awarded, is absolutely amazing and remarkable. Who does not hear the chords of the soundtrack by Nino Rota and automatically remember the movie ?Additionally all, \"The Godfather \" is a portrait of its time period and so it goes on all the other works of the trilogy. The film is built upon a significant historical period, shows not only the role of foreign immigrants and their difficulties in building an identity in America as it is also very thorough in addressing how the Italian mafia was organized for several decades in USA. For this and more, \" The Godfather \" is a film which must be seen, a reference that needs to be seen by all those who love movies and want to understand the social development of the United States at the beginning of the last century.", "The Golden Era- review by comparison": "The Golden Era of Hollywood in the late sixties and early seventies produced unbelievable work, but there are a handful of films here that set a different standard for masterpiece. Why The Godfather is at the top of them I do not know, but it definitely reaches out and pulls you in that direction. In its company are perhaps only four pictures: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 2001, Midnight Cowboy, and Chinatown. The only actor left out of this realm is De Niro, and if you include Taxi Driver, you have to mention Dog Day Afternoon, A  Clockwork Orange, Don't Look Now and Apocalypse Now- all bonafide masterpieces, but missing something in the breath of the first five. (Let's not forget where film here created myths on a par with all the greats of cultures old: Star Wars (and bringing to life the definitive one, Excalibar).  Shall we not forget The Graduate?  Two words: The Godfather!", "Not the best ever": "I personally believe that this movie is overrated. I don't really even believe it is the best work from a Coppola (I personally believe \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Lost in Translation\" are much better movies), but it still is entertaining to watch. It has notable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (perhaps the only Pacino performance other than \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" where he doesn't scream his eyes out), and the film also has a very nice screenplay, but the movie isn't as entertaining or extraordinary as other frontrunners like \"Casablanca\" or \"Lawrence of Arabia\". Maybe because this movie has been marred by so many rip-offs or clones, that the magic of the film has disappeared. The film just no longer feels ageless, and that's too bad.", "like watchin willlie's catch": "Baseball and Film are among my passions.   The soul craves seeing something done well.   Even people who know nothing about baseball can look at Willie Mays catch in  the 53  (not sure of the year) World Series and see that it is executed with perfection.Every sence in this Movie has a kind of Mauysian Catch quality. In the first sence,  we  see a man sitting at a dek with a most grandfatherly deamonor petting a pussy cat.  I first thought this was a deliberate attempt to make a statement he is so gentle yet a cold blooderd mobster.  Legend has it however, that the cat came onto the set by accident and Brando  (with the reflex of a Willie Mays) knew just what to do.\nWhen Tom is kidnapped  he is told \"If I wanted to kill you'd be dead alreardy\"   we are reminded that murder is a natural as breathing.From the time the undertaker begs for justice until the time Kay sees Micheal for a ruthless killer  we see acting as good as the Sey Hey Kid could catch.  To maintain this quality for a few sences is an achievement.  To maintain it in every sence for well over two hours is an offer no one should refuse.", "Greatest Movie of all time?": "In my opinion, easily one of the top five movies of all time.  I believe every person should sit down and watch not only this film, but the second and third ones as well.Coppola and Puzo collaborated to create a beautiful artistic picture. Although an organized crime family is depicted, the real story is about family, and love.  Michael's struggle is well documented, and as he attempts to stay away from the family business, his love for his father causes him to become a criminal as he attends to his father in the Don's greatest time of need.As it turns out, Michael proved to be the ideal choice for the next Don, and now the story begins to unfold.  The whole Godfather Saga chronicles one man's struggle to maintain his business but at the same time maintain his family.A touching yet tragic saga about a likeable man.", "An Opera on Screen": "Along with it's sequel, Godfather II, this movie is what American movies should aspire to.  Great acting, great story line.  The power of the family, the immigrants' rise to glory, the failures of society, the paradox of religion and violence woven together to form the perfect movie.  The characters are composites of real men and women in history.  The scenes fictionalize real historical events.  The Don's granting wishes to his neighbors remind you of Marranzano's despotic rule in the early 30's. The shooting in the restaurant mirrors Luciano's assassination of Masseria. Moe Green's execution is really Bugsy Segal's.  The climax is the night of the Sicilian Vespers.  This film is a classic.  Puzo's work is wonderful and Coppola's vision is perfect.", "Francis Ford Coppola's Masterpiece": "One of my favorite movies, in conjunction with part II. I can't say much here, but one outstanding element is the thoroughly believable though dramatic transformation of Michael Corleone. How does one who has always steered totally clear of his family's mafia ways, is an ivy league graduate and has returned from WWII as a Marine war hero become a ruthless, murderous gangster? Coppola achieves this tragic fall with remarkable subtlety and skill. Now that his buddy Lucas is done with Star Wars, it's interesting to see that Darth Vader fell due to the same tragic flaw: desiring as much power as possible in order to keep his family safe - even if it means becoming a murderer. (The Godfather is an infinitely better film than any Star Wars flick, though I'm a sentimental fan for life.) The other element I find most compelling is Pacino's projection of intense power and charismatic strength. His quiet words are more terrifying than the yelling and machine gun of any action hero (or even of Tony Montana). I can't help admiring his character, even though he is a criminal. His performance is so intense and convincing, I actually can hardly watch Pacino in anything else. Music, cinematography, acting, dialog, etc. are all phenomenal. It is a near-perfect film and the greatest modern tragedy I've seen.", "The most greatest gangster movie": "\"Never hate your enemies,It affect your judgement\"\nThe most greatest gangster movie which a man can't miss!", "A classic.": "It's a must-watch movie. If you are a fan of cinema, you need to watch it.At the start it can sounds over-hyped, but when you realise the hype is genuine you can see the beauty of this movie.You can not die without watching it. Go now.", "My favorite movie ever": "Think about this for one moment, \u00bfwhat makes a movie a good one?, \u00bfthe performances?, \u00bfthe cinematography?, \u00bfthe script?, \u00bfthe production?, \u00bfthe style?, \u00bfthe concept? \u00bfor all of them together?. \"The Godfather\", besides having all of this concepts, it has pasion and beauty. Every single scene is beautifully shotted and composed, this movie it\u00b4s used as an example of what is cinema. Cinema, it\u00b4s beauty or uglyness, cinema makes you feel something. I cried and laughed with this one. Since I was a kid, my dad rolled me this masterpiece and showed me how to appreciate it , not just \"The Godfather\", but every single piece of cinema I\u00b4ve watched. This movie taught me how to appreciate a film, it means a lot for me.\nAnyways, let\u00b4s leave my opinion for a moment and talk about why you should watch movie. First of all, the cast is amazing, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and more. Al Pacino, makes a perfect perfomance and Marlon Brand performs his best role in his entire career.\nThe director, Francis Ford Coppola, knows everything about cinema, I learned so much watching his movies, he doesn\u00b4t try hard in putting his style on, he just puts on his style and makes it happen with his absolute genius mind. The script is full of famous and memorable lines, Mario Puzo mixes poetry with crime into a family melodrama, every character is more than well written. The movie grabs you and takes you into the screen, I watched it so many times that I found Vito as someone of the famil, imagine the level of writting.\n\"The Godfather\" is my favorite movie of all time, I hope if you haven\u00b4t watched it, please do.\nThank you.", "The only movie that made want to think again about which movie is the greatest ever!!": "I have watched hundred of movies in the last 10 years and my all time favourite is/was \"The shawshank redemption\" i have always seen it as the best movie ever made but after watching \"godfather\" i just don't know anymore which one should be in top for me, one thing i'm sure of right now is that i have 2 favourite best movies instead of one.", "ITS OVERHYPED!!!": "I watched it 2 times and still dont see why people are so obsessed with this movie.

Brando at his best, and the big appearances of such actors as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire and many others. The writing is superb, i've read the book, and together with the film they are both my favorites, and the directing is Coppola getting the whole essence of the honor, respect, devotion, love, desire and revenge. is totally illogical that two films like the dark knight or the The Shawshank Redemption (great films by the way) are better voted that this, the greatest masterpiece on cinematic history", "this movie that made me love cinema.": "I watched this movie for the first time in 2018 and i enjoyed watching it a lot, which made me repeat it five times the godfather icon can not watch like it after 1 000,000 years", "hghjgjg": "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.", "Film Perfection": "When a person asks the question, \"What is your favorite movie?\" I hesitate to answer because it has almost become cliche to name Francis Ford Coppola's epic, \"The Godfather.\"  However, to name any other film would be a grave injustice to the majestic perfection that is indeed captured in these three hours of artistic achievement.  Instead of referring to the cliche without explanation, I am quick to point out that which makes this film deserving of such accolades:1.  Screenplay--Basically the essence of the film rests in the adaptation of Mario Puzo's best selling work of the same name.  Dialogue, scene dissection, etc. all are what truly makes the foundation of the film. \n2.  Acting--How can you go wrong when you have Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and on and on?  The names spill off the credits with wonderment.  Of course, keep in mind these names were not the household names of the day (albeit Brando's) but to look back thirty years ago and see these masters of their craft all working together, it is easy to see the dynamics of the acting and how it automatically makes the script look like a cakewalk to perform.3.  Direction/Technical Quality--cinematography, editing, sound and the direction of Coppola himself makes this film as \"tight\" as it can be in the timeframe devoted to the first chapter in the saga.  In sum, 1,000 words cannot even begin to spell out why \"The Godfather\" is my favorite film.  All I can say is that from the first frame until the final, you are left wanting more.  You are satisfied with the character development, the story line but even after three hours, you only become hungry for much, much more.  Thankfully, you can find that \"more\" in the second installment.", "the mob": "Brilliant work must see for see for this film will never and shall never get old", "An ultimate classic!!!": "When you ask people who know about film what they like the most about The Godfather you'll get a fast response: EVERYTHING! It's not the story or the actors or the director or whatever, it's everything together. Everything works  out so good, even under the heavy stress Francis Ford Coppola worked with throughout the movie. Maybe that's what makes this movie so great...", "A movie worth its actors!": "A must watch for every movie buff and specially for Fans of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The story shows how a man balances his work and family so well keeping in mind that his business is full of threat. Character of Vito Corleone defines what a real man is like and on the other hand Character of Michael Corleone shows how to contain anger and utilize it in most lethal way possible. This Story also shows how the mafia families have ruled the cities with both good and bad to their characters.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen.", "Superb Film - Horrible History": "Marlon Brando gives a performance that ranks among the best ever from any actor in film history - two of the others are his own roles in \"Streetcar\" and in \"Waterfront\".Robert DeNiro is without peer as the young \"Don\" in 1900 New York.\nJames Caan excels as the heir-apparent Don.The many character actors in this film are simply the best ever.The production values have never been equalled, and Francis Coppola's direction is probably the nearest to perfection as a movie can be.As a reflection of reality, however, the movie gets a Z minus. The Mafia was never like this, folks. I grew up in an area that had many \"wise guys\", and they were nothing like their portrayals in this movie. Without exception, they were incredibly dumb, but they had a talent for brutality. The notion that they were great organizers, negotiating like statesmen at their meetings, is completely absurd. What they did do well was beat up people - usually other Italians who simply wanted to make a living. They were, and are, thugs - pure and simple.The way they treated their women makes the Taliban look like feminists.So watch the movie, but beware, it's a MOVIE.", "super movie": "One of the best movie ever i watched.dont miss it, if anyone missed this watch it on amazon prime.", "the gadfather": "He was helpless, but used his life to make people understand how to learn to face difficulties.", "Back to re-product": "Eight years later, it is necessary to revise my own views.

You can also find that \"The Godfather\" brings audience a \"big screen\" experience which is enough to refute the opposition.", "One of the best classics": "One of the best classics of all time, good story, with incredible acting. Even though the movie was three hours long, it's hard not finish it.The sequence of the movie flows so good in a way, the audience are always wondering what's going to happen next. Very enjoyable, even for people who don't like Mafia movies in general, because the movie discusses many things in life like family, greed, loyalty and relationships.It's a really great combination that makes the movie one of the best movies of all time, and it always be enjoyable for future generations as well.", "Forever excellent": "If they ask me which films will remain forever excellent, \"The Godfather\" will be one of the first in this category. Filmed after the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, released in 1969, this film burst into all the lists of the best films and is now considered the best picture of the mafia. Director Francis Ford Coppola got the idea to make a film after reading the book. The film company Paramount Pictures regarded the project as a small gangster drama and did not expect much success. But when Puzo's novel suddenly became a bestseller, the stakes on picture quality rose sharply. And although the studio did not dare to fire Coppola in the middle of filming, fearing for their product, they tried to insert their five cents. In particular, they demanded that Marlon Brando not be involved in the process and that Al Pacino be dismissed.\nThe plot tells the story of a gangster clan where the old but influential don Vito Corleone runs the show. He has a beloved family, things are going well, everyone respects you - in a word, he rolls around like cheese in olive oil. But suddenly, an attempt is made on Don Corleone, and, as it was unexpected, a couple of days after the deal that would help another criminal clan, but Vito fundamentally refused it. And at a tense moment, Michael decides to solve family affairs and manage his father's empire - Don Vito's beloved son and a man who wanted to abstract as much as possible from the mafia but had to take the reins of government into his own hands.\nThere is a legend that after the premiere of the film, the director was called by the real gangsters in order to ... scatter in thanks. Coppola showed the world shown in Puzo's novel in as much detail as possible and showed the mafia bosses, ordinary people, with feelings. Speaking about the cast, no other word other than \"Beauty\" does not arise. Rejected the Oscar, Marlon Brando is a very talented actor. He makes him believe that his character has power comparable to the head of state but at the same time an honest, loving, caring family man.\nMichael Corleone is a character no less interesting than Don Vito himself. The hero has suffered many trials, as a result of which he changes and makes serious decisions. And behind such a strong character an actor should have stood, no less talented than Brando. 32-year-old Al Pacino is a year younger than the director, rocked Hollywood with his performance. I know that I praise this great actor enough, but it was The Godfather that became the starting point of his fame.\nWhen I hear that the film was shot from a book, I cross my fingers so that the creators do not lose the quality of the picture. But there is nothing to be afraid of since the plot canvas is carefully transferred to the screen. The Godfather is not so much a gangster drama as a story about love, family, power, and betrayal.", "Good, but not Fanboy & Chum Chum good": "I'm gonna make you an offer you cant refuse......... watch Fanboy & Chum Chum, it's so good", "Superior": "My brother is a big fan of this movie, he suggested me to watch this and I must say I loved it.

What on earth was Michael Corleone doing not taking antidepressants?! Michael was a very depressed character and the fact he didn't seem to take any antidepressants in this film baffles me as I thought that would've been obvious for him to do.Antidepressants may be undertested a lot and may frequently make people infertile but it's totally worth it if it means stopping a potential suicide of someone like Michael. I'm disgusted with this movie and my heart ached for the Autistic man known as Michael Corleone to get help and good drugs from a pharmacy in this movie.", "Mafia King": "Probably the best Mafia ever!

There are so many movies better than this one out there, don't waste your time with this. I suppose there must be lots of fans of this movie like there is for lots of other violent pointless ****house movies such as Sin City and the likes, I guess this just highlights that there must be fairly big problems in our society today, why would anyone find this sort of negative and pointless junk enjoyable? The way that this sort of thing is portrayed in movies as being \"cool\" is really quite sickening, I wonder how many people who have had personal experience with murder and violence would find this sort of thing enjoyable, not many I would say.

He refuses, however his eldest son Sonny (James Caan) shows some interest in the Narcotics trade, giving Sollozzo and 2 other mob families the opening to take out the Don and make the offer to Sonny, the assassination happens, however Vito lives and it is getting close to a mob war, however Michael (Al Pacino) Vito's youngest son says that he is ready to have a meeting with Sollozzo and the crooked cop that is protecting him Captain McClusky (Sterling Hayden) which ends up with Mike killing both the cop and the narcotics dealer, with Michael feeling to Sicily a mob war occurs leading us to some tragic and harsh events.There are a lot of sub-plots, details and major characters that i left out but i was explaining the starting point of this classic.The film is a portrait on family, the general state of America and the entire point of the character Michael Corleone, the people that claim that The Godfather is not an accurate depiction of the mob did not get the point of the film, this film changed the way films were made, before The Godfather you had to be a Bogart or a Wayne but after this masterpiece the names Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro could star in major motion pictures of a mammoth scale like The Godfather.It is not only a visual feast it is also the perfect film as the only things wrong with the film were continuation errors, the acting and everything is up to perfect, Francis Ford's directing was one of the best directorial efforts ever.This film made a lot of stars packed with some of the greatest acting performances ever given (Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan etc).10 out of 10 from me.", "Godfather is Amazing": "The Godfather is an absolute \"Classic\".

The Godfather is probably the most quoted (and spoofed) movie in history. Every single thing about this film is perfect. The home-movie feel, the cast, the crew- everything. What more is there to say? 10/10", "One of The Best Movies Ever Made!": "This film is one of the best! The acting and the chemistry between them are amazing. In this film Tony Montana is Micheal Corleone, born as the last child of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, the head of the Corleone family (Spoilers!: You see more of Vito's background in the second movie) , a big family in New York. But Micheal isn't like Tony, but though the movie he does some crimes for himself. The soundtrack blends really well with the sounds of the movie, you hear it but it isn't too loud, nor it's too low. Marlon and Al really make this movie. If you haven't seen it already, well buy it on Blue ray or watch it on Netflix. It gets only better when you seen all the trilogy.", "An epic you can't refuse. (May contain spoilers)": "On the 15th of March 1972. I sat in my apartment at the age of 17 with my girlfriend. We decided to go see a movie. We heard that there was some big premier of some sort at the cinemas. We went and saw 'The Godafther'. We expected an average film. But from the minute it started we were stuck into it. Back then we had no idea who Al Pacino, James Caan or Robert Duvall were, but because of this film we now do.Basically the film follows the rise and almost fall of the Corleone crime family. It tours us through the everyday life of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family. Don Corleone is like a different kind of police commissioner but he has his own ways of punishing people (E.g. A man comes in and asks for justice after his daughter had been beaten, and the police failed to put them away, Don Corleone orders them to suffer). The film also follows the outsider of Organized crime and the Don's youngest son (played by the then unknown Al Pacino: giving a chilling performance) who has fought at war and come back with no part in crime. All goes well until the Don refuses a deal with someone powerful who reacts by gunning the Don down. Michael is then forced into the mob in order to secure safety for his family.I could name 1000 reasons why The Godfather is and always will be a classic. It garnered 10 Oscars and took home 3 including Best Picture. I was surprised that almost every other award was lost to Cabaret, after all I believe that the supporting Oscar nominated performances (Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall) were more worthy that Joel Gray in Cabaret. It was a pure and entertaining experience at the cinemas, it was very quiet because everybody was listening to the characters sharp dialogue. The film reminds me that everybody is a good guy in their own opinion, he is not pure and cold hearted, he is just another police man who has his own way of doing things.Do not miss this film, 10/10 all the way. All the masterfully set pieces such as: The severed horse's head in the bed, the baptism multiple murder, and Many memorable lines. The masterful performance by Brando, the chilling performance by Pacino and the calm and inspiring performance by Duvall all help to make this film a classic.", "An Unexpected Great Movie": "I went into this movie with the mindset of this will be overrated. After watching, Goodfellas, The Departed, and The Irishman, I expected The Godfather would be the same. All I expected from it was to be the first best mob movie, which set the trend of all other mob movies. As I started watching it, I quickly realized it isn't like the other mob movies. It is better. It has more of a story and character development. The Godfather is one of the best mob movies ever, with an actual story and character development. The acting is impressive, and the story is even better. This is 100% a must-watch if you are into mob movies or classic movies.", "It is The Godfather. What can I say?": "From Freddo, to Vito and Michael, the acting in this movie is too good, you forget you're watching one. Every single character in this movie is an icon. The score is also great and sets a very chilling atmosphere. The experience from watching this movie is like none other. It is very engaging and I can easily say it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Yes. I say film now because it sounds more passionate than movie. If you haven't seen this film don't wait. This and Part 2 will be one of your all time favorites. Part 2 is boring if you haven't seen Part 1 (I made that mistake because of my college film professor). But once you watch part 1, Part 2 is equally good and both are top 5 films of all time.", "Wow! Francis Ford Coppola is a genius": "The Godfather is an excellent movie for: 1.- The Actors 2.- The Director 3.- The Music (in my opinion a magic soundtrack) In conclusion the best film about gangsters in the history (although the Second part don't is least)", "My Favorite Movie of all Time!": "Brando, Paccino, James Caan, Robert Duvall. What an ensemble of talent. And of course Francis Ford Coppola.", "Can't believe it took me so long to watch this": "The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the \"family business.\" The \"family business\" is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk \"business,\" they often use the phrase, \"It's not personal, it's just business.\" They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men's \"family business\" and the women's family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men's work, usually by a door.The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren's life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other's sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she's been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family. Seeing these acts of family loyalty makes it clear that family is the one thing that people of this time believe in above all else.One of the best things about the Godfather is since it was an ensemble movie with many stars and lead characters, there is a constant fear for the characters safety. In some movies, there are only one or two main characters, so you know that they aren't in any harm or real danger until the end of the movie, and even then rarely. In The Godfather, several of the Corleone family members, rival members, and family friends die throughout the movie, even some of the big stars. Don Vito gets shot, survives, and then suffers a fatal heart attack later. Sonny gets gunned down in the street by a rival family. A supposed family friend, Sal Tessio, tried to set up Michael in a deal with the Barzini family, and they kill him. Seeing important named characters die throughout the movie makes it seem more realistic and more fearful of any dangerous situation they talk about.The biggest underlying struggle throughout the entire film is corruption versus loyalty and trying to make the best choices for the long term that will benefit you and that you can be at peace with. Corruption of loyalties, business matters, and family is rampant throughout the film. Sal Tessio gets paid by Barzini to try and get Michael killed. Carlo, Corinne's husband, baited Sonny into the open so Barzini's men could gun him down. Even the Corleones are guilty of using corruption to their advantage: They murder and mutilate the prized horse of a filmmaker so Johnny Fontane can get a part in a movie. The internal struggle of each character trying to stay devoted to their family while staying on top in the business is enticing to be a part of for a few hours.", "Seconded best film ever made": "Behind the it's sequel, this film in my opinion is the second best film ever to be made.", "A Thirty Suttin's Perspective Of The Godfather": "Its amazing how movies from the 70's are so different from the movies in 2020. The Godfather really goes in depth as far as character development is concerned which for many younger viewers may seem boring. Well buck up kido's and keep watching because this movie is amazing.The film makers of old really put a lot of thought into not only complex characters, but settings, backdrops, and the muic. No matter your age, if you are going to be a film critic you are goign to have to watch this film and learn to appreciatre it by watching it multiple times until you do.On a side note, if you are looking for someone to fool around with in the bedroom, Bdirti . com is the place to go these days for that sort of thing.So yeah, get a few pounds of popcorn popped for this one, cuz its a long one. Peace!", "a cinematic masterpiece": "I did not have high expectations before watching the movie cause I thought it may be overrated. I could not be more wrong about this initial thought. Probably the best most incredibly done mafia movie I have ever watched. After watching some of Scorsese's best mafia movies I thought I had already met cinematic excellence, but \"The Godfather\" overcomes that. Al pacino and Brando's acting is good enough to make any cinema lover whip a tear. Definitely a must see film.", "No one can beat it. one cult classic movie ever": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute.", "A Great Movie At All": "A perfect movie with its acting, script, image and the way the story works.You are taking a great step into the mafia world with the realism of the created world inside.The fact that each actor plays their role at the highest level adds a different atmosphere to the film.I don't want to extend it too long, it's simply a perfect movie.", "Be tenacious": "The determination of Vito that Michael inherits is brutal, it is not a determination that grates with recklessness (as is the case of Santino), it is a determination that waits patiently, as in that dialogue from C\u00f3modo in Gladiator, about the waiting viper. This aspect of the film may come from the same book, but the distant glances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino before the problems seem incredible to me, of how they plan and ruminate thoughts and plans simply sitting in a chair. I love this movie.", "Best Flim": "The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover.", "Outstanding film of all time!": "Can not say anything this film was just marvelous. Despite that the actors were incredible amazingly perfect!", "What makes a movie a good movie": "In my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater, or puts a feeling on you that you haven't experienced. You have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing.I also ask what makes and entertaining movie. To me its one that you just cant get enough of. You can watch over and over again and it never gets old.", "Possibly the best movie anyone will ever see": "Possibly the best mob movie, and possibly the best movie you will ever see. This movie has plenty of mob violence and extreme thinking to find out the enemy that hides in the shadows.  Marlon Brando is possibly the best actor you can find for a godfather.  The unexpected son Michael becomes the Godfather and is violent and will destroy whatever enemy opposes the Corleones.  It also had a great ending, where the two people kiss Michael on the hand, where he is officially the Godfather.  Great movie.", "The Acting": "Phenomenal acting by all cast members. It really illustrates some part of the world we live especially when it comes the Italian Mafia. Nothing more to say about it other than The God Father was the pinaccle of flawless films.", "Greatest movie ever": "This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever. The acting is 10/10 the story is 10/10 and the whole movie is just amazing its an absolute classic.", "Synopsis": "There is only one word to describe The Godfather and that word is \"beautiful\". I say this because of the way the film is crafted. The beginning starts out with that most memorable theme tune and then cuts to a discussion in the room of Don Vito Corleone.\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\" BrillianceThen of course comes the scene with the horses head in the bed of director Woltz. This is probably the most memorable scene in the film for me.Then comes the attempted murder of Don Corleone. Sonny is killed at a toll. Michael's new wife is blown up in a car bomb. Vito Corleone retires as Don and dies of a heart attack whilst playing with his grandson.Michael Corleone is made Don.", "not so fair": "it is not good as pulp fiction, because this film just shows that an older mafia dies and his son takes control, this type of films are more common,but pulp fiction which is a master piece and narrates an hit mans story with good type of narrating. this film does not deserve to be in 1st place, because they didn't made any effort on acting. it also has many errors on film making.this film was a good movie for those who saw the movie in the olden days, but now the this film has no effect on the viewer, but movies like pulp fiction, the shaw shank redemption are really extraordinary creations of directors. i don't know why it is still stuck in the 1st place.", "Outstanding!": "Very powerful acting, story, directing, and everything else.

It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.", "The best of the best. Perfection at a glance.": "I believe that \"The Godfather\" is a masterpiece, an excellent movie which I have seen about 6 times. I have not gotten bored by watching it, thus I wait for a next opportunity to watch it again. The problem is that now I feels like a 90 minutes movie instead of a 171 minute film. But it's still great. I saw the three movies in one day, and let me tell you that the movie changed my life. My mind thought differently and I began to feel stronger, better self confidence. I'm not saying that I started to kill, but I can relate to this film. Probably I'm not the only Godfather fan with this feeling. I can confess that I've not read the book, but before I die I will read it. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's worth it. I wish I were born before the movie came out so I could see it at a movie theater. I am waiting for the DVD version, and I hope it comes out soon. So I guess I will have to buy a DVD player!!! But for now I enjoy it in VHS digitally remastered. The acting is incredible, like if the actors were real, like if the Corleone Family really existed or does exist.", "Fantastic movie!": "The film is almost three hours, but you can't call it long, making it two hours long would have turned out to be a stump that would have lost its value. In three hours, a whole life unfolded on the screen with all its charms and blows. We can see how people change over time. And what previously seemed alien, wrong in an instant becomes everything in a person's life. As I said, a film of incredible depth, to conquer which you need to see the story to the end.10 of 10.", "Positive and effective effect of the film.": "The body language as well as the character of the godfather of the film are included and we see his beautiful acting. This film shows the prestige of a powerful person and at the same time Badright.", "The Godfather reaches new levels in film-making and is a must see for any film enthusiast": "The Godfather is a masterpiece in terms of cinematic achievements which boasts near flawless acting most notably from Brando at his scene stealing best. The film is brought to life with a strong script and a haunting score from Nino Rota. If you care for films, make sure you get out and see this. It is brutal without being unnecessarily graphic and moving without being unnecessarily sentimental. We build up a fantastic relationship with the characters and we care an awful lot when something important happens to them. It has been said that this film \"gets better as time goes on\" but I am not so sure of this as the general taste of the audience is not for this kind of film. It is a refreshing break from the mind-numbing trauma that is Transformers and other heartless Hollywood Blockbusters. One of the greatest films of the 70s? No. One of greatest films of all time!", "afshin arashtanabieh": "Very good film. I like it so I suggest it for the others to famili show this for the other people.I underestand that your work is so hard on this film.Thank you for direction this film.Good luck.", "Possibly the greatest movie of all time": "This movie is up there with movies like Citizen Kane as the greatest movies of all time. It's flawless on all filmmaking standpoints from its top tier screenplay, to its universal and complex themes, smart and sharp social commentary, brilliant and gorgeous cinematography, fantastic editing, and subtle emotion and a genuine understanding of human psychology.It's a long movie with methodical and deliberately slow pacing, with subtle and restrained performances, complex characters, and one of the greatest casts ever.Like I said earlier, the pacing is slow and methodical. Not to say the pacing is bad by any stretch, but it's slow (which is perfectly fine). It's deliberate and takes its time to tell its story. Coppola has a very interesting habit of not cutting shots until absolutely necessary which makes the important moments that the film focuses on feel even more important. Even with the 3 hour runtime, I was constantly engaged and glued to my seat.The cinematography is brilliant with my personal favorite showings being when Michael concocts the plan to kill Solozzo and McClusky, or the opening sequence. But the cinematography in the film is just drop dead gorgeous. Every frame is perfect, and I'd change nothing about it.The acting, my god. The cast is great. Subtle and nuanced performances, but they're capable to becoming explosive when necessary. From James Caan's portrayal of the animalistic Sonny, to John Cazale's depiction of the meek and weak Fredo, Marlin Brando's depiction of an aging mafia lord, Al Pacino's realistic transformation from kindhearted war hero with strong morals to a coldhearted and ruthless crime lord who focuses only on business. Robert Duvall's performances as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, etc. Are all just brilliant. Brando's performance in particular is in my top 5 greatest performances of all time. It's a performance that I can't quite pinpoint what works so well about it, but still sticks with me months after my first watch.I love the classic and universal themes of family, betrayal, power, fate, corruption, responsibility, etc. Along with its sharp and layered critique of the idealization of the \"American Dream\". The way in which the film opens up its world is brilliant and draws you into a world of epic proportions.As well as that, If I may be frank, I think Michael Corleone's character arc is while somewhat straightforward, is masterfully portrayed, and very well may be the greatest character arc in fiction. Of course, I can only put that as a possibility as I have not seen enough movies, shows, or books to be truly certain.Besides all of this, it's just a damn good story. It's a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, a brilliant crime drama, a character study of a man boxing himself into undesirable circumstances, etc. It's able to be funny, serious, heartfelt, tragic, and downright nerve-wracking. I still hold the opinion that the dinner sequence is among the most suspenseful sequences in movie history.So yeah, this is at the very least a top 3 movie of all time, and I'd say you could make an extremely strong argument for it being the greatest movie ever made.", "A masterpiece of culture and anthropology": "As an Qatari man watching this film for the first time in 2009, it struck me how much I got attached. More than four decades later, and a generation apart, and to a culture so distant from mine, and still this film strikes as one of the most memorable. What makes it that was the question that not only haunted me for years, but also pushed me to study filmmaking and dive intro the subject. This film has not only influenced my awareness and thinking, but ultimately my career and life.", "Too long,good acting": "The movie is too long and almost put me asleep. Even though,great acting by Al. The story is not unique and not interesting. I know it's popular to love the movie as a classic piece, but i didn't like it so much.", "Simply put: The greatest film ever made.": "I know the title \"the greatest film ever made\" is thrown around too loosely, but The Godfather is the one movie that deserves it. It deserves it's place at #1 in the IMDB's top 250.The depth in The Godfather is phenomenal. Every character has their own problems, their own stories, their own lives. So many times in movies characters lives revolve around the plot, but in The Godfather the plot revolves around the characters.The acting is perfect. There is so much subtlety in every performance. A single look from Al Pacino expresses so many different emotions. It is a shame he was never rewarded an Oscar for any of the Godfather's. The movies center on him and his flawless performance.The atmosphere of the movie is also excellent. There is always an air of tension or foreboding. Practically every scene is a classic moment with a classic line.It is the mafia movie to which all mafia movies are compared, and none of them hold a candle to it. The only mafia movie I would put close to it is Scorsese's Goodfellas.If there were 11 stars this would be the only movie I would give it to.", "The best for all time": "The Godfather is one of the best movies ever, the movie is made for 30 years ago and it\u00b4s the best movie i ever seen and will see. If you think \" Casino\", or \" Goodfellas\", is a great gangster movie than you should see The Godfather all parts. I recommend this movie to all over 18 so they can see the beauty on this, i dont really belive the teenager will see that.", "A great movie": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.", "Will continue to withstand the test of time": "This has to be, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. It is pure entertainment and master film-making. Despite its length it maintains interest throughout and, by the end, you're wanting more. POSSIBLE SPOILER! Marlon Brando (Don Corleone) deservedly won the Oscar, with his fine performance. However, because he is absent from a majority of the film, it is the superb support from Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall (who all got Oscar nominations) that really keeps the film at an A-class standard. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER!    The direction of Francis Ford Coppola is practically without fault and so is his writing, also contributed by the author of the novel, Mario Puzo. This is the gangster film that has inspired so many others (including Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" and, on TV, \"The Sopranos\"). The music and cinematography are outstanding and even the costumes are great. All in all, you can't find a fault with this film. All the elements work and it is just so satisfying. People who think it's over-rated are just fools who couldn't recognize great filmmaking if it hit them in the face.    It is hard, however, to judge whether part II is better or not, but one thing for sure is that it's as good as part I and better than part III. If you haven't seen this film then I suggest you rent it or buy it immediately because you really don't know what you are missing. Francis Ford Coppola once said that at the end of the day nobody knows anything about what is a good movie or a bad movie, unless it stands the test of time and that's how you know what's great. So true and certainly in this case for The Godfather, because it has and will continue to stand the test of time.", "Kinda Trash": "This movie doesn't have Jared Leto in it (Morbius superstar), so I refuse to indulge myself with it.

This movie is so good that it's not just a movie, it's a movie that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time.One thing that makes this movie a classic is that it defined how bad violence in a movie can be. When you see movie character Luca Brasi stabbed in the hand while he's being strangled to death, you realize that the director likes to take this movie seriously and make an example of how far a movie can go when it comes to violence. I'll admit that when I saw this movie for the first time in my life it wasn't very good in my opinion. When I saw this movie being #3 on AFI's {American Film Institute} Top 100 American Movies Of All Time, I thought it really didn't deserved that spot. But when I gave it another chance, my opinion changed. I said to myself, \"This movie represents the best of movies like what the Statue of Liberty represnts to America\".In short, this movie is fantastic. What Star Wars is to Sci-fi is what Godfather is to Crime-Drama, meaning it's a perfect example of the genre. There will probably never be another movie like this in many decades to come.", "The Godfather: A Masterpiece": "This movie is flawless. It would be quicker for me to discuss the negative factors about it as opposed to each great aspect, however this would result in a very short review as I have not been able to criticize one thing about this film.

Each main character is portrayed differently and has their own unique personality and as in reality, these characters change throughout the movie and the trilogy as a whole. In particular I believe that Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as the tragic character of Michael Carleone were the standout performances, but each actor and actress should gain respect and recognition for contributing to this work of art. The music in the film is absolutely stunning and is a perfect portrayal of love and respect. In turn, the music adds to the film's overall greatness. Most of the people who criticize this movie as boring to too lengthy and those who have not yet seen it. I can understand why this film has been listed as the best movie of all time.

Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone.", "Brando, Brando, Brando!": "What can one say?The plot of The Godfather is legend. The classic scenes and moments never stop coming at you. With such a gallery of great and interesting characters, how can they not? And then you have the brilliance of the cast to make it all possible. And yet through all this. The moments, adventure and excitement, Marlon Brando still manages to shine far beyond the rest of the cast.Judi Dench won one of those golden men for Best Supporting Actress after only 8 minutes of screen time. Well, Marlon won the big one after limited playing time in The Godfather, a movie that lasts for nearly three hours.When you think about how he still owns this film, it's close to scary. He haunts th screen, his presence is always being felt, he's always in the back of the heads of the other characters.Why? Because of greatness. Because he is the symbol, he is the reason why we think of the word Godfather in an entirely different way.", "Words are not enough !!": "everyone knows its one of the best movie. but you don't know is this is the movie that comes once in the history... its made me think like i am the godfather. i am the MOB !! you can not say if the actors are acting... its real..missing this art, should be considered as a self-disgrace. i don't know what the associates got into them, and if that is normal or spiritual (if there is) but surely it is something that can not me done again.. thanks to everyone to giving one audience this much of peace and something beyond words ..THANK YOU !!", "Highest Literature of Movie Arts": "Everybody know the fate of the Carleone Family. Everybody knows the voice of Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. The Story is exciting, sad and lucky. Francis Ford Copolla's Masterwork is fascinating and the highest art of making films. This artwork has to be called biggest and highest literature of movie arts!!", "THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE": "Omg this movie is a masterpiece and I will never forget the soundtrack in film and I will never forget this film ever\nThank you\nFrancis Ford Coppola", "GREAT FILM, STRONG ACTING": "This is a strong film with great acting. Marlon is at this BEST in this film. The story line is strong and well written. Audiences are holding on to every moment to see what is going to happen next. #FABULOUS", "Best movie ever made?": "There is no such thing as a perfect movie. But god damn it, the Godfather comes close. The storyline, the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the cinematografie. It's all really good. It is a classic movie I believe everyone should see at least one time in their life. Yes the sit is kinda long, but the time flies by so fast you won't even notice it. And after 3 hours, you still want more.", "A true classic.": "The best screen play of all time. The cast, the setting, the storyline, make this movie an all time great. With names like Pacino, Brando and De Niro associated with the Godfather, was it ever going to fail? I don't think so. A true classic, depicting family values in its truest form, a must see for the generations of both today and tomorrow.", "Master": "To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.", "Uncomparable": "Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.", "My Favorite Film of all time.": "I just created an account and knew i had to review this movie first.The Godfather is easily the most impressive movie because of the following: The directing is top notch,Coppola reveals his first masterpiece within an instant. The cast is Probably the best iv'e ever seen,which includes Brando,Pacino,Duvall,Caan,Keaton and many,many other great actors/actresses.The screenplay is very faithful to the book,proving adaptations can be perfect.Most of all the story itself,which for me never get boring to watch.Their really isn't a straight path story here,we have a movie that represents life in the 1940's as the crime families from each district confront their differences leading to a bunch of events that i won't get into. Overall this movie amazes me every time and iv'e seen at least a dozen times,each time better than the last. I have to give a personal thank you to Al Pacino,who is easily my favorite actor delivers one of the best performances to date.I cannot emphasize enough how perfect Al was for this role. To think they actually doubted him at first,wow just imagine him not in this movie is beyond me.I love this movie half to death,if you haven't seen it and are a movie lover like i am you definitely need to Netflix/Buy this movie!!!!10/10", "Peace of sh, t": "Very overrated and i waste 3h of my life watching this old movie..\nI hate when somebody talk about the godfather's acting", "The greatest !!!": "There are those rare kind of movies that you can watch over and over again. The Godfather is definitely one of those. It's a timeless work of art. Never have I watched a 3 hour movie that had me gripped from start to finish. It's a movie about family, greed, religion, honor where you really feel for the characters. The story is fantastic, the acting superb(especially Marlon Brando), the music, the set pieces... everything comes together in this masterpiece. It's also on of those few old movies that I can watch again and again.I can't praise this movie high enough. In my opinion the greatest movie of all time!!!", "Not the first nor last": "I am not the first, nor last to watch The Godfather and be utterly intoxicated by what is on the screen. When I first saw this film 8 years ago, I was entranced by the colorful characters, the Nino Rota score, the story and the saga. But every viewing since then brings something new. The nuanced performance of an unassuming but unflinchingly confident Al Pacino. Every time I think that they almost cast Jack Nicholson, I can't help but wonder. The way the wedding scene at the beginning lulls the audience into a sense of family, tradition and honor before putting all of it to the test in the remaining 2 hours of run time. There is no better example of crime film, drama film and acting combined with writing. The lines are rich and quotable. There is no scene that is superfluous. And once you see it, you will want to see it again and again and you will notice things every time you see it. Rarely does a filmmaker bring together this caliber of actors that bring together their characters with such color and vitality. You feel for every character on the screen and for every character who departs from the family. You feel almost that this is your family, too. That is the investment that can be made in this film....to lose one's self in its depths.", "The Don of Mob Epics": "The opening marriage scene is incredible. It is not rushed, it takes at least 20-30 min and it develops the characters so well. You are immediately immersed in Don Corleone's world. It's beautiful to watch this film build anticipation through engaging discussions between characters and not a bunch of action. This builds excitement that climaxes in the restaurant murder scene. The cinematography is incredible. You feel a part of the scene. Several characters are defined and developed throughout the film. One of the best movies of all time.", "Boooooring": "Title says it all.... This movie was long, and cut out the best parts of the book.  It had a good cast, but that can't make up for poor transition from the novel. Bottom line: read the book, it's better.", "The Movie": "One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.", "One of the few films that are adapted from a book and the adaption is better then the book itself": "The 1st instalment of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather is considered by many to be in the top 50 films of all time. It has everything you want in an all time classic, with exceptional acting from the likes of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall. Mario Puzo's classic novel adaption delivers one of the few adaptations of a book that's better than the book itself. With perfect soundtrack, perfect dialogue and perfect acting, Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the best films you will ever see in cinema history.", "slow to start": "My husband loves this movie so I tried watching it. Really don't know why it is so highly rated. Hard to get into it. Very slow start.", "one of the best movie": "Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honour.", "Perfection.": "\"The Godfather\" exists within a vacuum: it is without precedent, and (not for the want of much effort), it is without imitation. To try and objectively review this Film, after its effect on my life, would be a poor joke. Frankly, I adore it. It is Romantic, absolutely. Beyond belief. Even Technically, it's a paradise. The colours drip, rich and heavy. The characters hold up a mirror to our psyche, and the dialogue has rightly cemented \"The Godfather\" as a movie which will always have a relevance. Ironically, this tale of counter-culture has become arguably the definitive Pop Culture statement. \"The Godfather\" IS the gap between Mainstream and Art. It is the scale to which every \"classic\" must compare itself, and inevitably fall short. Concise Coalescence: \"The Godfather\" is the greatest Movie ever made. But that's not why I LOVE it. Sure, I respect a whole bunch of Films. I can recognise a Film's influence, award it its dues, and move on. But I keep coming back to this, because I feel an affection for it. Every time I hear that sweeping Ni\u00f1o Rota score, I'm reminded: this changed my life! Days spent dreaming of my future as either a Mafioso or a Film-maker. To a degree, \"The Godfather's\" reputation does it a disservice; this isn't a Movie to admire, it's a Movie to FEEL. And I guarantee you, it's so powerful that only a truly emotionally dead person won't feel it.And so I again ask myself: Why is it I love \"The Godfather\"? I love \"The Godfather\" because it never becomes cute or cuddly. I've just waxed lyrical about it, but as I sit to watch it, it's still dark, it's intimidating. It never gives itself up to soppy nostalgia, and that's why it remains as shocking a statement now as it did more than a quarter of a century ago. Perfection.", "Notes to the Soundtrack": "I think the best attribute to this movie is the atmosphere it holds. A large amount of credit to that is due to the wonderful soundtrack. It's simple tunes represent the romantic, mysterious, dangerous life of the mafia. It adds effect at the right times to make the memorable scenes even more memorable. But the real reason I'm writing this isn't to rate the movie because I'm horrible at writing reviews. The purpose of this comment is for anyone who loved the movie that plays a musical instrument and is interested in learning a few ditties. It's not much but here are the notes to what I call The Godfather Theme.G F# G G# G G D D G F# G G# G G C# C# I hope you can figure that out. Here's another that is often heard.C# F# A G# F# A F# G# F# D F# C# C# C# C# F# A G# F# A F# G# F# D C# C I think that's right. If your wondering how I learned this, I spend a good amount of time in front of a piano/xylophone or something along the lines of it. I know this isn't real specific but I hope it can be helpful to someone. I'll be changing this if I feel I have to correct it or add on to it.", "Subtle": "The Godfather (including Part 2 for purpose of this review) is probably the most analysed film of all time, so really I don't see the point in repeating any of the rhetorics. Rather, what I intend to provide here is my honest two cents of this film.The Godfather is not an easy film to watch, so it baffled me at that time of watching for the first time (and still baffles me to this day) how it is so universally loved by almost anyone who has watched it. Firstly, there are so many characters that I gave up remembering anyone other than the Corleone family. Secondly, the script is so subtle and tight that the moment I missed a single sentence, I did not get the next scene. It was no easy feat to follow every sentence given the frequent mutterings, so subtitles are almost indispensable. In the end, I pretty much referred to the plot synopsis every 5 minutes.Make no mistake, the reasons above are also what probably makes the Godfather regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It just surprises me how a film as subtle as the Godfather has received just as much attention as 'lighter' classics such as Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc.Ultimately, my verdict is that the Godfather is a great, iconic film from the 70s era, but my honest take is that the Godfather is perhaps a little over-hyped (not overrated, but over-hyped) to the extent that it gets more exposure than some of the other equally great films from the olden era. For that, the Godfather is a great film, but is not in my consideration for the greatest film of all time.", "No movie can get any better than \"The Godfather\"": "A Masterpiece of its time and all time, this movie defined the term - \"blockbuster movie\" and set the ultimate limit for a cinematic masterpiece. No one would have ever believed that this movie would have such an impact on popular, mainstream American cinema. The executives of the studio that funded this movie's production just seemed to keep their fingers crossed and hoped that the movie wouldn't bomb really bad in the box office. Their fears were not unreal. They were taking a mammoth risk by funding a movie to be directed by a 'risk taking, not so popular' director starring many unknown actors in major roles and to top it all, the story was to be adapted from a decently popular fictional novel. All these factors could have kept this movie down. If it weren't for the amazing talent exploited really very well in every department, aspect of the movie, their worst fears would have been realized. \"The Godfather\" established many careers and gave life to many interesting personalities to have ever graced the screen. A \"Definite Watch\" for anyone who wants to know what a 'perfect, no non-sense movie' is all about and also in general, an engrossing movie that grows on you over time.", "Simply The Greatest Film Ever Made!": "I love this movie! I will gladly be the first to admit, that I have always been fascinated by the Mafia, and that particular lifestyle... It's an incredible ride! It will deliver every genre of film you could possibly want: Action, Drama, Comedy, Suspense, and Romance... The performances in this movie by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale are simply the best acting you will ever see... I've always said if I can't believe the actors in their roles, then I will not recommend the movie to someone, In The Godfather, Everyone performs their roles... Perfectly! I know this is a long movie, but trust me, I have seen it so many times, and it is the only movie that I've ever seen to keep my attention the entire running time.I am a huge movie person, and I will also admit I'm still pretty young, but what I do know is The Godfather tops my list as my all time favorite movie! I've cried several times at the expanse of the Corleone Family! I wish I could truly sum up how emotionally gripping this movie is, but I just can't, I could try all day, but I would keep saying oh I'm missing this, or I'm missing that... I am also reminded of what Marlon Brando said, and I apply this to my life everyday... \"A Man Who Doesn't Spend Time With His Family Can Never Truly Be A Real Man!\"", "good but dull": "okay i saw this movie and it isn't really worthy of being in list of top 5 movies. i mean i have seen many movies that are 'much better' than this movie.personally i found this movie to be just about the people who say 'family first' and believe too much in morals and honor. the movie is good but its not really that good to be rated in the top 5 movies.the movie is slow and very slow and at moments i felt sleepy with those dialogs regarding how one should treat another or how if you do this you wont get porked or whatever. i am rating this 6 for okay-ish plot and good acting.", "The greatest movie!": "One of the best films! Probably the best gangster - mafia drama of all time!", "Classic Gangster Film": "Godfather is not just ...A... classic gangster film it is...THE... classic gangster film. Marlon Brando is an amazing actor when he's not a big fat lazy jerk reading his lines off of a piece of paper hanging on the wall (and yes he actually did crap like that from what I heard in class) and this is one of his best performances if not the best performance he ever did. Robert Duvall and James Caan are always the same in their performances but they are good in this, probably because they are so young and their shtick wasn't old yet. Pacino is really very good. His weak brother is also very good in his role. The ladies in Pacino's life are very good. I really loved this movie, the drama is great and also there are some really great violent gangster action scenes. The scene where Sonny is racing to town in his old car and gets stopped at the toll booth is an all time classic, don't want to give away details but it sticks with you. Awesome movie!", "Wonderful film": "The Godfather is a technically instructive film with its dark and realistic atmosphere. The cinematographer of the movie, Gordon Willis, used shadows and contrast in such a way that you say this is the movie while watching it. While watching the dark and beautiful atmosphere, you also watch the plot. Some people may be bored in the first scenes while watching the movie, but I was not bored because the mafia theme was a theme that I loved before. The film chronicles the conflict between the Carlone family and Comma Solozzo over her drug business. Don Carleone politely declines the offer, calling it a \"dope\" dirty job, but Solozzo, who is not very happy about it, arranges an assassination on Carleone himself, causing things to heat up. This is the crux of the movie. We are watching the characteristic change of Michael, who normally has little to do with family affairs. Michel first kills Solozzo to avenge his father's death, and then takes over the family business. It's as if that innocent child who watches family affairs from afar is gone, replaced by a calm but cold killer. Michael is actually the opposite of his brother Sonny. While Sonny is an irrational person who cannot control his anger, Micheal is logical and just as calm. Although \"The Godfather\" is a crime movie, it is actually a movie based on the father and son relationship. The best example for this is the scene where Don Vito and Michael are alone. In this scene, Carleone says that she has always worked for her family all her life, and that she will not be ashamed to work, but that she has never thought of Michael as the head of the family. It was a pretty good movie for me, but I can understand that it might not appeal to everyone. In this movie, your main focus is not on the life of the mafia, but on the fact that you cannot trust anyone but your family and you have no one but them. Otherwise, why would anyone turn their family into a criminal organization? We see in the movie that almost everyone betrayed the father except his sons. (Virg\u00fcl Solozzo, Tattaglia family, Carlo, Tessio) When I said you can't trust anyone but your family, I meant this. Finally, I have a cut-off message that I don't like the Godfather and hate him all his life: Watch The Godfather not as a mafia movie, but as a father and son movie because only then can you love this movie. Enjoy or hate the mafia theme.", "A truly incredible masterpiece": "The Godfather is a movie that will never be forgotten. I watched it when I was 11, and I fell in love with it then.This is a movie about an Italian mafia family living in New York. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the family, and he's always been taking care of everything. The movie first shows how the whole business works, with making sacrifices, keeping promises, and getting revenge. Sonny and Michael are Don Vito's sons. Everyone knew that Michael was the smart, elite \"college boy\" of the family, and Sonny was the completely opposite, and someday he'd be the head, the new Don Corleone. Michael doesn't want to be involved in the family business, until Don Vito gets shot by some of his enemies because of the whole deal about whether drugs should be sold or not, and troubles start to happen. Michael knows he's the only one who he can save his father. When he agreed to take revenge to the enemies who shot his father, he had gotten himself into a completely new life filled with violence, hatred, and betrayal, a world he had never experienced before, and there's no turning back.I'm not gonna say what's going to happen next, for the people who haven't seen this yet. But if you're one of them, make sure you see this. This movie is absolutely perfect and flawless.", "Definitely one of the finest movies ever made": "Francis Ford Coppola has done some brilliant work, but he has never been better than in The Godfather and the sequel. This is a complex story set in New York City in the era just after World War II. It involves the Corleone Family, an Italian-American family that has thrived in the U.S. as the father of the clan (Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando) turned to organized crime to gain his slice of the American Pie. I won't get into the plot too much for fear of invoking the \"spoiler\" rule, but the essential plot revolves around a dispute between the Corleone Family and one of the other crime families over Corleone's unwillingness to engage in the illegal drug trade.Although the movie is strictly Hollywood fantasy in its treatment of the American Mafia (it is NOT this glamorous), the Godfather does play on some real life plot twists in the history of the mafia. For example, Carlo Gambino, the head of the most powerful of New York's Five Families for decades, did in fact have a strong moral and practical opposition to the drug trade which led to his famous edict of \"deal and die\" for those under his command.The plot is a modern version of a Shakespaerean or Greek tragedy as the family patriarch(s) rationalize their actions in the name of protecting the family. It's a classic plot line that has been around for centuries, but it has never been better than in the Godfather. The direction is fantastic and the acting is unreal. Brando as the father is flawless, and Al Pacino and James Caan are brilliant as the sons. Also, the supporting cast is also first rate. Look for great supporting roles from Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Sterling Hayden and a host of other talented actors.Anyone who doesn't love this movie is either lying or just trying to cause trouble. 10 out 10 for sure.", "Organised Crime Goes To Hollywood! What's changed? Nothing!": "Francis Coppola's The Godfather, and Godfather pt. II have made their names known rightfully as masterpieces of cinema. They are both executed with razor-like care and crafted atop a foundation of brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a brilliant script by a brilliant writer, brilliant photography, brilliant production design, and a brilliant score. And it was the first film to give mainstream insight to the world of Ogranised Crime - an insight so true that Mario Puzo was questioned by the Mafia about his sources.But The Godfather is not just a vehicle of power for its wonderful foundations and brilliant everything, it is a drama about war between families - about destruction within families. From the film's buoyant wedding opening scene, we are instantly emerged in Coppola and Puzo's world of rich characters and gripping stories. This film could have been about a mining family in the nineteenth century - though things would have to change - and it would still be as entertaining, as tragic, as exciting, and as masterful as it is just now.", "Good movie, classic": "Yeah its a good movie I guess, not the greatest of all time in my book but still vastly enjoyable by movie fans of all sorts, even fans of other types of movies", "All you nutty fans.....take it easy on me!!": "OK, I am 32 and have seen the vast majority of this film several times, particularly when I was younger. I have just bought the DVD boxed set for \u00a320 and watched the 1st film the WHOLE way through for the 1st time.Oh my god. This film is absolutely brilliant. I always had Casino and Goodfellas as my top 2 gangster films. I am now re-writing my list!! Blown away by the acting, script, cinematography and sheer realism. There are so many scenes that will be used in film study courses for decades to come.One of my favourites, which some might find surprising is when Vito has the heart attack whilst playing with his grandson. The young boy plays the scene to absolute perfection. Of course, Brando just keeps up what was an excellent performance throughout.I had memories of this film being quite difficult to follow as a youngster. This may have been in part due to the sometimes muffled voice of Brando, but with the help of subtitles at my dumbest moments(!), the plot and characters are actually fairly easy to keep up with.Cant really say much more. If you like your gangster style films and need advice on whether to watch....its a no brainer. Its quite a long film so keep the distractions to a minimum and be prepared to take a couple of toilet breaks! I just wish that I wasn't working tomorrow otherwise I'd watch the next one now instead of tomorrow evening!", "A Great Film That You Should Definitely Watch.": "*****Spoilers Ahead***** 'The Godfather' is a film that everyone knows about. It is the type of film that is so heavily ingrained within popular culture that every reference, parody, and outright copy is almost a culture unto itself. It is because of this that even if you have not had the pleasure of viewing Francis Ford Coppola's master work, you feel like you have. It is also because of this that a surprising number of people never get around to watching 'The Godfather'. Afraid that they'll be entering a world of endless Mafia clich\u00e9 and hackneyed dialogue, they steer clear of this gem of a film. A few days ago I was one of those people. Now - after picking up the box set for the meagre sum of fifteen pounds \u2013 I would count myself as one of the lucky portion of the population who has seen 'The Godfather'.For the uninformed the story of 'The Godfather' is, on the surface, simple gangster fare. The film, set in the late forties, follows the trials and tribulations of the Corleone family \u2013 one of five mobs in New York \u2013 as they try to stay on top as the supreme power in the city. What actually comes is a complex tale which carries weighty themes such as the corruption of innocence, the loss of the American Dream, and the cyclical nature of a life in crime.What struck me most about 'The Godfather' was how sedate it was when compared with other pieces of cinema. A few nights before, I watched 'City of God', a film about child gangs in Rio De Janeiro. This film, although slick and well presented, ultimately didn't leave much room for reflection on what is a very heavy and ugly subject; It left me feeling cold. It tried to point out the horrific state that Brazilian slums were in, but was so desperate to look good that it almost missed its own point.In stark contrast, 'The Godfather' is nothing if not thoughtful. Every scene, although well directed, never tries to point out its own style in any kind of pronounced manner. This could be more to do with older directorial styles but it still stands out. In a time when films revolving around gangs are nothing but frenetic gun-toting festivals of violence, blood, guts, and vague subtexts, it is refreshing to see a film that presents its concepts and central themes in a way that allows the viewer to actually digest them. Any on-screen violence that does happen is necessary to move the plot forward and is exactly the way cinema violence should be \u2013 blunt, seemingly real, and uncomfortable to watch. It is as though the film has sat you down and said \"This violence here. You see that? Pretty nasty huh? You don't want to see it again, do you? No? Good. Now listen to what we have to say about the flawed nature of the American Dream.\" It actively makes you despise the brutality of a life in crime by making it feel relentlessly vicious.This is illustrated in one scene involving family member Michael in a caf\u00e9. His task is to kill the two men opposite him. A train can be heard outside. As the noise of the train becomes louder and louder we see Michaels hand in his pocket, desperately toying with the gun. His face is tense and sweating profusely. The train grows louder and louder still, its cacophony overwhelming to the viewer, and you can feel the tension that must be welling up inside of Michael until he eventually pulls the trigger in what turns out to be a fairly botched assassination. Not only does this type of abhorrence to violence help make you acutely aware of the horrid nature of the 'family business' but it also drives Michaels story along as he becomes more desensitised to this type of brutality whilst he climbs the ranks of his business before becoming the patriarchal figure that he had, at one time, no desire to be. By the end of the film, a killing is nothing in the eyes of what was once an honest American citizen with unfortunate family ties.I mentioned in the opening paragraph that 'The Godfather' is a film that is referenced so much that it is easy to pass it by whilst still somehow feeling like you've watched it. Although you still kind of get that feeling on viewing, it feels more like a welcoming friend than a clich\u00e9 ridden hammy mess. From the iconic music to the infamous line \"We'll make him an offer he can't refuse\", from the horses head in the bed to badda bing badda boom. No matter how many parodies of 'The Godfather' you may have seen - and there are a lot of them \u2013 these moments that we all know of never detract from a full viewing. When everything is in context and being performed by an astonishingly good cast you forget about every other crappy gangster film you've ever seen and just get sucked straight in.In conclusion, watch this film. No matter who you are or what films you usually like, watch this one. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's worth just experiencing such a beautifully made film. If you can pick up the Coppola restoration then it's even better to look at. Do it now. Watch it!", "Best of best mafian film": "This film represents a complete and perfect mafia life. Of course, this film has a great impact on the lives of the audience. We also see that a brutal mafia can be a good father and a loyal wife. In this film nothing is far from reality and everything is realistic.Corleone's character represents a powerful, serious, and reliable man.", "Hey": "I try to find an old animation movie that I watched as a kid on TV in the 90s (it could be older) and made an enduring impression on me. I remember the ending most vividly: a bloody battle on the top of a hill where two armies clashed, apparently led by a man and a woman inside cyborgs or some kind of robotic vehicle. These two seemed to share a history (fling?? / siblings??) and confronted each other beside a nearby river. They both died. The movie ended tragically with a shot of the great tree on the top of the hill, surrounded by corpses of both armies.. The only other thing I recall is a young man and a woman that spent the night in a house and in the morning the woman transformed in a butterfly and flew away. The man tried to catch her but without success. The butterflies (souls??) seemed central to the movie. It was all very depressing (as you can imagine :-P) but it was so powerful animation that stuck to my head for years! I tried to find it in IMDb, google and anime sites through keywords but to no avail. It seemed to be Japanese animation but I cannot be sure..", "Excellence": "The Godfather\u2014Masterpiece. Watched this movie the other day and was surprised how good it is. Quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. This is what happens when you have excellent writing, superb directing, great acting, and the right sound track.This is a story about family, set to the backdrop of the Mafia. More than anything else, it is about the ascension of Michael Corleone, from WWII hero into the ruthless world of organized crime. Brando was certainly deserving of his Oscar, but Al and Francis should have won one as well.It's the only movie I've seen where every scene matters and every scene is memorable. Probably too violent for some, but is definitely on my list of 10 movies everyone should see.Way to go Francis!", "The Best Movie Ever": "I'm forgot how many time i watching this movie. The god father trilogy the best movie ever on 20st century.Don Corleone make this movie so strong. He send the message for us if family is number one.", "The Marionette in Coppola's Hand": "The first part of the unassailable trilogy by Francis Ford Coppola , The Godfather set in the early 1940s follows the life of Don Vito Corleone , the aging patriarch of a crime dynasty who transfers the control of his empire to his reluctant son Michael Corleone. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name by Mario Puzo , The Godfather is one of the only two films based on a Pulitzer prize winning book which went on to win the prestigious Oscar , the other being \" To Kill A Mockingbird\" .\n When narcotics hits the streets of New York and tension between the five families (Strachi, Cuneo, Barzini, Tattaglia, Corleone) heat up , all of the families wind up supporting Virgil Solozzo to avoid a long destructive war. \n The film has every odd in its favor as Brando pulls off the performance of a lifetime portraying Vito Corleone, Pacino introduces his innate and instinctive whit and, Coppola's meticulous direction which shapes up into a genre defining timeless classic of the west. While Brando and Coppola walk home with an Academy win each, Pacino wins hearts all over.\n Released in 1972 and often crowned as the film of the decade, the film however does not appeal to people of all ages. Despite being a timeless classic, the film may at some points come across as very strong and too violent.\n A deep untwisting plot supported by iconic performances and impeccable direction, the film narrates a story about crime, drama, redemption and an offer you can't refuse. All in all, ' The Godfather' comes out as a benchmark in classic film making and speaks for itself. Even after all the years that have gone by and all the years to come the film continues to elate and appease the viewers, who return the love for the same.\n\" Watch all the movies you want but remember it is a sin to skip The Godfather \"", "An absolute masterpiece. Epic": "So just like the reason I joined Metacritic, once I seen there actually negative reviews for The Godfather on here I just had to sign up.For anyone who has yet to see The Godfather, please do not believe any 'review' that gives this classic any less than 9/10. The negative reviews on here are laughable; one in particular by Revan is pathetic. Anyone who is stupid enough to genuinely think The Godfather is not a great movie has no idea what makes a good film what so ever.The Godfather is near perfection; the most important aspect of any movie has to be the acting itself, which in the Godfather will blow you away. Featuring the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando, in one of best ever performances. The rest of the cast are almost as impressive with absolutely no weak performances at all.The story is superb and totally compelling and its just one of those films that is so good you just do not want it to end. I actually envy people who have not seen it in a way, as that first time is the best.Without any shadow of a doubt, the greatest gangster movie of all time, and probably the best movie of all time as well.

This makes it impossible to watch this film with a truly open mind. Anyone wait bing this film will most likely have very high expectations for this alleged masterpiece.The film wasn't bad. The narrative was interesting, the dialogue was clever and it was executed perfectly with some of the greatest acting talent ever seen on screen. It was a good film, a great film in fact but the greatest film of all time? Not quite. The film felt too long and was at some points hard to watch, almost even boring and although there are few things wrong with the film it just feels as though it is missing something special that would be expected from 'the greatest movie of all time'. That said the film was somewhat enjoyable however it's reputation left me wanting something more and sadly the prequel films weren't quite that something.", "One of the greats": "As far as i remember, the storyline was very impressing. In a \"making of\" video, i found out, that for Ford Coppola it was hard to get the movie done. The production was not easy and the producers didn't wanted Al Pacino in the first place. I remember watching the movie on and on in my teenage years. Everytime you could discover something new about the movie. For me, the most interesting thing is the detailed development of the characters. Coppola still managed to show this details in the plot, although the development of the whole family is so complex.The story is great and this is something i miss in the movies today, not because of nostalgia. No wonder it is considered a classic.", "Greatest movie ever made": "If anything is close to being perfect, this is it...", "A classic movie most people have Seen!!": "The Godfather Trilogy is a classic combination which connects and represents the living Visible lovely Golden Era of Fame and Glory of 1972.The Godfather of the Corleone Mafia Family showing the complexities of that time of the MAFIA .The mafia is represented to be an Organized Crime Family which is Represented in the AfterWar of WWII .Showing what Mafia Figment of things happened in Families of New York.**************THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSICS EVER************", "greatest classic": "Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.

I personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring. There was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way. If you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you. I don't mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining. When I was forced to watch the Godfather I & II in my cinema class I wish I had a pillow to put on my desk so that I could sleep. If you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the Godfather on and you will be asleep in no time.", "Coppola's Way": "The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): \"Don't ever take sides against the family.\"It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

The Godfather is a mix of perfect Directing, Story Telling, and Acting. Marlon Brando of course was great as Don Vito, Al Pacino was awesome as Michael, Robert DuVall, James Caan, James Cazale, and Diane Keaton were all great in this movie. The thing I like most about the movie is that, although it is fictional, it is very accurate on how the Italian Mafia was. I mean the realism of the Crime Family and all the conflicts that they had with other rival Families. Francis Ford Coppolla and Mario Puzo did a awesome job on adapting the original novel to the screenplay. It is just simply magnificent. 10/10.", "Better with age": "My father tried to sit me down and watch this when I was younger. He had always said it was required viewing.

This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a \"famiglia\" with that kind of activities. This movie is the \"standard\" for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts. I don't know if this movie deserves to be #1 of all times but surely it's the best movie of the genre I've ever seen.", "This movie is Okay": "And somebody has to do something about this hype\nHonestly\nbad acting, boring and shallow plot\nthe movie is beeing watched only due to its hype", "A movie masterpiece": "From Brando to Pacino, this movie exudes class, Pacino a relatively unknown actor, who grows from a reluctant mafioso outsider, to boss. The story that grows is simply one of the best that converts to cinema, the scenery, the era, the cast, all contribute to a stunning three part drama. Personally, Brando gives a master class in timing, delivery, to the extent we can all see, he is the boss, in this star studded film. I will leave you with this advice, please , watch it a few times, there are pieces of the film you will miss, it's only after reviewing it a few times will you pick up on the nuances that make this epic a stand out.", "part 1 is the best": "This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.", "Mario Puzos Vision made reality": "The book was an excellently written piece, and the film most definitely does it justice. With a star studded cast, a strong plot behind it, and great videography this film has secured its place in Americas film hall of fame.The performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando Robert Duvall, James Caan, et. al. are amazing. The most amazing thing to be a part of, as an audience member, is to be fully invested in the characters (in terms of commitment to their character). I would highly recommend this movie for any old film buffs, or anyone looking for an old school mobster film, and finally anyone looking for a truly excellent film.", "How i feel about the movie": "The Godfather is a very intense viewing experience. I really liked how they used the bottom lighting so he could not really see who was talking at the beginning, it left a sense of suspense about it. The suspense of what could this person's business be what is there business what do they do. Why are they coming to the Godfather for help? The other thing I really like about the film is how before he goes to get the gun from the bathroom to shoot the men in the restaurant. When he gets to the bathroom he takes the gun and has to calm himself down, then he goes to shoot the guys and hears the sound of a train right before he does it. I feel that the intensity of the train noise rising as he is about to shoot them was a brilliant choice of thing to do because it shows how he is thinking about it. I do not like how they used low lighting all the time. I get it is a dark type of movie but it does not need that type of lighting like all the time. They could have used neutral lighting because that is not light but not dark at the same time. I feel like that would have worked better because low lighting ended up making the scene look way darker than it had to be. The Godfather was a very good movie and overall it was a very nice movie with an amazing story-line. The way they portrayed most of it was amazing but when they overused some of the lighting is what made me kinda feel off about how some parts of the movie may not be that great. I did like a lot of the sounds in his head.", "It's Good": "Its goodIts goodIts goodIts goodIts goodIts goodIts goodIts good", "Book might be better": "It feels that the movie skipped and adapted so much stuff, which makes it even harder to understand. Might want to read the book.", "A gangster guide": "This is one of the movies that inspired milions of people to take control over their lifes. Few have succeeded but the ones that followed the happening closely took advantage of it and rebuilded the age of honor. A whole book can be written for one of the greatest pictures of all time and we could not be even close to explaning how good actually it was! For those who haven't watched it yet it's a must! For those who watched it I'm sure they've watched at least a thousand times. If I must say a few words for the acting I might say that I am not among the big fans of Marlon Brando but his role in this movie is the role of his life! What can I say about Al Pacino? Genius! Only one man could have played the role of Michael Corleone and that is him! I even thing that Brian De Palma didn't think twice when he had to pick the actor for Scarface 10 years later. All the rest are on the same level and whenever we see them in other pictures we think about The Godfather. Lets just point them out - James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale and much much more!", "My favorite movie ever!!!": "Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,Francis Ford Coppola,Mario Puzo,and the filmhistory.One of the best movies ever.The Godfather always give me power.", "A TRUE MARVEL": "I have been watching movies since last 35 years but have never been drawn more to a movie that can influece you to make your own film.

To make a masterpiece.Godfather has been adapted by thousands or filmmakers which made a few great and a few legends, but there is no movie like the GodFather. Storaro at his very best, Brando at his prime, Al pacino in his element brought it all for the Director and the studio make their dream come true. One of those very rare must watch classics.", "Its ovverated": "Few people are not aware of the existence of this film. At least because of private mentions, references and parodies, almost everyone knows that there is such a movie and approximately what it is about. However, if you read the short description of the picture or don't watch the movie very carefully, you might get the impression that this is just an ordinary movie about gangsters. I'll be brief. Although the film is a classic, it is NOT worthy of the title of a masterpiece. What masterpiece is it when the film is just stupidly stretched for more than 2 hours thanks to the dialogues, the plot is about nothing at all. I watched it only because of the young Pacino, and then on rewind.", "Nice Story": "I Like the story of movie. fantastic naturalization of movie including sound in movie theater is very good.", "The most incredible art piece of the 20th century": "One of the most amazing Movies in the history. Very close to the original source and masterfully done. I believe everyone should check out this masterpiece.", "no doubts, the best of all time": "This film is basically the closest anyone is going to get to movie perfection. Coppola really hit the jackpot Puzo's novel and made the most out of it, I mean, many directors get their hands on some great stories and all they can do is mess the whole thing up. However, Coppola stayed true to the original novel, thanks in part to Puzo himself collaborating in the process of the screen writing, but also was able to give the movie his own feel, similar to what he did with Apocalypse Now. Also, visually, Coppola manages to show the 1940's mafia environment in the most stunning, and real, fashion.WARNING:SEVERAL SPOILERS ALL THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE COMMENTThe scene were the Don gets shot really shows what i'm talking about, and obviously the whole wedding at the beggining does the job of putting you in the environment perfectly, also it is a great introduction of all the major players. Also, the whole section were Michael is at Italy, it is downright beautiful, a great contrast to all of the violent stuff that happens in New York, all of this beauty ends with Michael's return to reallity, his wife's death. This then will make Michael the man that he becomes toward the end of the film, and through the other two films in the saga. Another great example of the \"horror\", is the scene with the decapitated horse is a showstopper and illustrates why Coppola is a genius. However, the heart of the film is in the perfomances themselves. Every single one of the characters is played to perfection, even after reading the novel, there is just no other way I can think of Vito Corleone, but by thinking of Brando. He is the Godfather, period. Well, so is Pacino, who shows that this is only the first of his many great performances. What can I say, to of the greatest performances in one film. The rest are not less great, Caan is convicingly stubburn and hotheaded Sonny, Duvall is great as a contrast to Sonny, always being more practical and reasonable (similar to Michael, yet lacks the superior IQ, and the coldheartedness), Cazale portrays the wimpy Fredo as what Fredo really is, whimpy. Diane Keaton plays great as the naive Kay, who in the end will finally realize what she has gotten herself into, but only too late, and all that is left is to accept her fate and learn to live with it. Shire is also very good as a drama queen, but not much else. The rest are just great mafiosi. Finally, to cap it all off, the music is beatiful. It is the trademark of the film, it is so famous that I know people that can recognize the music as the godfather tune, but have yet to see it, hey, even Slash used to play it live. Basically this film is perfect in everyway, ever since I saw it for the first time I compare every film to it, as a measuring stick, and to this day haven't been able to find a better one. This is one of those films that is not good enough to watch once, but to watch as many times as possible, it gets better everytime. After this, all the other films, are just that, other films.", "The best movie of all time.": "To this day, I have never seen a work as well done, very well written, directed and acted as this one. Everything about this movie is perfect, both the atmosphere and the music. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie but I would watch it again if I had to.The part where Michael knows Apollonia even though it is short is very well told. The film grips us from beginning to end.

Marlon Brando is magnificent as the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and got a very well deserved oscar for his superb portrayal (This is one of the best parts of the movie history and he is unforgettable as the patriarch of the Mob family), Al Pacino is also very good in the role of Michael Corleone (this role marked the beginning of his elegant career), James Caan is good as Sonny, academy award winner Robert Duvall is also unforgettable as Tom Hagen and Academy Award Actress Diane Keaton is very good as Kay.

Other actors have also done a fabulous work and the acting department is actually very much advanced and strong.\n2) Dialogues - Dialogue used are just perfect there's a time when you become a fan of the dialogues and dialogue delivery. And mark my word after the film you will say \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\"\n3) Storyline - The best thing about Godfather is his storyline. Even after being an almost 3 hour long film, the film has so many unpredictable twist and turns that keeps you guessing what's next.Bad things:-\n1) Time duration - Film is quite long and even after having so many twist and turns, the films still makes you tired.\n2) Storyline - Film has lots of twist and turns but the major drawback is that it has so many twist and turns that at some place you are not able to connect with the movie.\nThe film is masterpiece and a must watch for film who want to learn the act of acting and dialogue writing.

It shows the families descent into more and more serious crime. The number of quotable lines is massive just showing how cool it is as well. Once your hooked on the film you wont look away and wont leave your seat once. The acting by Marlon Brando is so convincing that you could believe he really was a mafia don.

At the beginning of the film, Michael not only didn't get involved in the family business, but also planned to marry Kay Adams, a Protestant high-class American.

That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): \"Don't ever take sides against the family.\"It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.\"I went to the police, like a good American,\" the man says. The Godfather's reply will underpin the entire movie: \"Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . Then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.\"As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.The screenplay of \"The Godfather\" follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told \"someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .\" and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito's desire to spare his wife the sight of their son's maimed body. And notice how a woman's \"mistaken\" phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It's done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out.Now here is a trivia question: What is the name of Vito's wife? She exists in the movie as an insignificant shadow, a plump Sicilian grandmother who poses with her husband in wedding pictures but plays no role in the events that take place in his study. There is little room for women in \"The Godfather.\" Sonny uses and discards them, and ignores his wife. Connie (Talia Shire), the Don's daughter, is so disregarded that her husband is not allowed into the family business. He is thrown a bone--\"a living\"--and later, when he is killed, Michael coldly lies to his sister about what happened.The irony of the title is that it eventually comes to refer to the son, not the father. As the film opens Michael is not part of the family business, and plans to marry a WASP, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). His turning point comes when he saves his father's life by moving his hospital bed, and whispers to the unconscious man: \"I'm with you now.\"After he shoots the corrupt cop, Michael hides in Sicily, where he falls in love with and marries Appolonia (Simonetta Stefanelli). They do not speak the same language; small handicap for a Mafia wife. He undoubtedly loves Appolonia, as he loved Kay, but what is he thinking here: that he can no longer marry Kay because he has chosen a Mafia life? After Appolonia's death and his return to America, he seeks out Kay and eventually they marry. Did he tell her about Appolonia? Such details are unimportant to the story.What is important is loyalty to the family. Much is said in the movie about trusting a man's word, but honesty is nothing compared to loyalty. Michael doesn't even trust Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) with the secret that he plans to murder the heads of the other families. The famous \"baptism massacre\" is tough, virtuoso filmmaking: The baptism provides him with an airtight alibi, and he becomes a godfather in both senses at the same time.Vito Corleone is the moral center of the film. He is old, wise and opposed to dealing in drugs. He understands that society is not alarmed by \"liquor, gambling . . . Even women.\" But drugs are a dirty business to Don Vito, and one of the movie's best scenes is the Mafia summit at which he argues his point. The implication is that in the godfather's world there would be no drugs, only \"victimless crimes,\" and justice would be dispatched evenly and swiftly.My argument is taking this form because I want to point out how cleverly Coppola structures his film to create sympathy for his heroes. The Mafia is not a benevolent and protective organization, and the Corleone family is only marginally better than the others. Yet when the old man falls dead among his tomato plants, we feel that a giant has passed.Gordon Willis' cinematography is celebrated for its darkness; it is rich, atmospheric, expressive. You cannot appreciate this on television because the picture is artificially brightened. Coppola populates his dark interior spaces with remarkable faces. The front-line actors--Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall--are attractive in one way or another, but those who play their associates are chosen for their fleshy, thickly lined faces--for huge jaws and deeply set eyes. Look at Abe Vigoda as Tessio, the fearsome enforcer. The first time we see him, he's dancing with a child at the wedding, her satin pumps balanced on his shoes. The sun shines that day, but never again: He is developed as a hulking presence who implies the possibility of violent revenge. Only at the end is he brightly lit again, to make him look vulnerable as he begs for his life.The Brando performance is justly famous and often imitated. We know all about his puffy cheeks, and his use of props like the kitten in the opening scene. Those are actor's devices. Brando uses them but does not depend on them: He embodies the character so convincingly that at the end, when he warns his son two or three times that \"the man who comes to you to set up a meeting--that's the traitor,\" we are not thinking of acting at all. We are thinking that the Don is growing old and repeating himself, but we are also thinking that he is probably absolutely right.Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. All of the other roles are so successfully filled that a strange thing happened as I watched this restored 1997 version: Familiar as I am with Robert Duvall, when he first appeared on the screen I found myself thinking, \"There's Tom Hagen.\"Coppola went to Italy to find Nino Rota, composer of many Fellini films, to score the picture. Hearing the sadness and nostalgia of the movie's main theme, I realized what the music was telling us: Things would have turned out better if we had only listened to the Godfather.", "Masterpiece of all times": "Godfather is the best movie of all time and it's perfect in everything.

You can do it legally or illegally. Second thing is always being calm and strong-minded. If you are calm and strong-minded, you will be able to protect your family. This movie teaches people it.

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.", "Goodfather...": "The best movie I've ever seen.I have seen this movie more than twenty times.The pride of world cinema.The actors in this movie are great\nFirst-rate screenplay, soundtrack, dialogues, actors and director.", "a true work of art (spoilers)": "All I can say is that this is the best movie of all time.  it has a great plot, excellent acting, great costume and set design, outstanding direction, and a very beautiful soundtrack.  The Godfather has many famous scenes such as the restaurant scene when Michael(Al Pacino) kills Solozzo(Al Lettieri) and McCluskey(Sterling Hayden), and when the movie pezzonovante wakes up with the severed head of his prized horse in his bed.  There's the brutal killing of Sonny, the gunning of Don Vito(Marlon Brando) across from his office, the car bombing of Apollonia, and the opening scene with Amerigo Bonasera(Salvatore Corsitto) telling the Don about how his daughter was beaten brutally.Though the most incredible scene is the Baptism Sequence.  Word's cannot describe it.  The way the organ goes from a mellow to haunting and how it goes back and forth between the church and the assassins preparing to kill the heads of the other New York families and the actual killing of the Dons. This is Francis Ford Coppola at his best.10/10", "A History Hailing Untouchable Masterpeace of a film!!!": "Everything about is really great the soundtrack, the story, and everything, 100 out of 10.", "It's too bad": "It's the most bad movie i watched ever in all my life i don't like it never ever, how grose that is, i don't believe that.", "A Wonderful Masterpiece The Godfather": "The Godfather has set the boundaries off all crime drama films that have ever been shown to people around the world. No one, will ever go beyond this film, it is truly magnificent. The film shows how the Corleone crime family want revenge on the men that tried to destroy them and there old beloved Don. Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando can been seen as some greatest acting that has ever been placed inside Hollywood. The famous line \"I'll make him an offer he cant refuse\" will always be rembered. Brando plays a character that is a family man, who wants to keep his family safe from the underwold. As well as to get out of the family business. He man who never wanted his sons to go join him, but yet he could do nothing about it. He is man of respect, a man who knows when the right time is, no matter what the situatuion is. He is the Godafther. When he was nealry killed by the drug baron called Sollozzo, he knew that his time as Don was up. He knew that there would be war, bloodshed,and that he could do nothung until he was ready again. His oldest son who was hot headed, angary, but a wonderful tactican like a general could never run this family. His second son Fredo was not man enough to to do his job. He youngest son though, the person who killed Sollozzo, was a calm, thoughtfull, ruthless man, and would be the person to take over the family business. Even to his displeasure, that he never wanted this to happen to his son at all, he knew it was the right thing to help bring back the weakened Corleone Crime Family, into where they belong. The king of the American Mafia Underworld, and the only way to do it is to destroy the five familes of New York.", "Family, power and tradition in our lives don't blend together that's what we learned from the movie": "A very exciting drama with a very interesting story, wonderful acting and wonderful special effects that embody the meanings of pain, love, care, the meaning of (the end) for every human being in this world and his written destiny for him.", "I fell": "Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film.

From the sound aspect, one scene is when Mike was in the meeting with Soulaso. The sound of railway turns louder and louder when he feel so nervous and finally covers the conversation. The restaurant is actually beside a railway, but the sound is also subjective and emotional at this point. From the character aspect, one classic point is the depiction of the old godfather. The directer uses half an hour to depict a head of family that values family, friendship, and carefullness while most other movies tried to reach a contract within the first fifteen minutes.

Needless to say it never gets old!", "Definition of Art": "I did not know what art was until I was introduced to this love poem. Even better than the book. Godfather represents the history of America's immigration. In other words: a hist\u00f3ria da minha fam\u00edlia.", "Great movie but extremely overrated": "The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and that's fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesn't give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you don't doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. It's such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow.", "!!!": "The film really catches with its plot, well-chosen actors and their game, atmosphere, dialogues. The quality of shooting, I think, is quite a subjective moment. Personally, for example, I really liked it and I just can't imagine how it is going to be presented differently.", "Must See Classic": "Such a classic, I watch it over and over and I find more things I missed the last time.", "i never seen this type of movie ....amazing": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene.", "This movie is one you can't refuse": "I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it for the first time about a week ago and have not been able to stop thinking about it since. The acting of both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is simply phenomenal. Pacino's never-changing serious demeanor perfectly conveys the life of a mobster. One can almost feel bad for Brando's 'Vito Corleone'. He is displayed as an old man who loves his family and will do anything to make sure they thrive rather than a ruthless killing machine. There is violence, but it's not over-the-top gore. It's all done in good taste. I found this movie to be very interesting because I know next-to-nothing about the Mafia. True, this movie is long at almost 3 hours but it's worth it. Now, to mention the music. I thought the music was truly beautiful and timeless. It perfectly captures the essence of the movie. . I've had the theme song stuck in my head for days now. At times my heart was beating fast for the characters out of suspense. I cried when they cried. I really felt some of the deaths. Overall, I feel as though this movie rightly deserves the title of 'Greatest Movie Ever Made'. I could watch this movie over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a timeless classic and, currently, my favorite movie.", "Mindbloiwng": "It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.", "Flawless movie with maybe some Mafia Inacurracy but overall a master.": "The Godfather has to be one of the most masterful and perfect films of all time. Francis Ford Coppola does a great job in directing by creating great suspense and drama in the film as well as the dark theme meant in the book. Mario Puzo did a wonderful job in turning his best-selling book into a movie script with a little help from Coppola. This film also introduces some of the greatest actors in the crime genre which includes great performances by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The beginning of the film is the only part that I hated because it was so long and boring too but I guess there was probably no other way to begin the movie I guess. I like how they show a lot of the Italian and mafia culture in the film but they do tend to mistake a lot of mob culture. First of I looked at the film and the guys don't ever talk like mob guys. In the real mafia everyone curse including the higher ranking and elder bosses. I surprised by the lack of profanity in the movie and I think the only I time I ever heard a curse word is when Sonny said the \"N\" word at the dinner table which I have no clue why he said it because it was so random. Also they get rid of a lot of power away from the Captains of the capo-regimes. I never heard much talk of the business from Tessio or Clemenza which is really is out of the mob ranking style. Also despite this being a great mafia movie they don't make the mobsters cruel enough. I mean come on we all know that these guys are monsters and murderers make them look that rather than some fat guys who are rich and love eating cake. Well one thing they did get right was the asking favors thing with the Don and screw him for not getting into drugs. Overall I'll recommend this movie to anyone but please don't judge by the boring beginning please see the whole movie before you judge it.", "Still at the top of my list": "The Godfather was an epic novel, an excellent story, and the movie could have easily been botched on numerous levels; instead, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create an enduring masterpiece of modern cinema. This excellence he achieved in spite of the constant harassment and general incompetence of Paramount Pictures. Coppola was almost fired by the studio several times during the filming of this classic, yet he managed to persevere and realize his vision through to the end. The casting, direction, acting, cinematography, and story are all top notch. Add to it a beautiful score by Nino Rota and you have the #1 IMDb movie of all time. This is a movie I have watched many times and found few weaknesses.If Paramount had its way, The Godfather would have been much different. In this alternate reality, Coppola would have been fired and replaced with some studio sycophant director. There would be no Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, since Paramount felt Brando was a troublemaker. Michael would have been played by Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford since Paramount wanted a \"prettier\" leading man. Al Pacino, despite superior acting ability, would have probably remained undiscovered. The story would not have taken place in the 40's and 50's, but instead would have been contemporary in order to minimize production costs. To be sure, the ultimate result of Paramount's expediency would have been unmitigated disaster. Thankfully, Coppola fought Paramount throughout the entire production, and much like the Godfather himself, refused to dance on the strings of those Paramount pezzonovante.", "i don't get it": "honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! i would've enjoyed it more if it was shorter. i really don't get how its one of the most talked about movies of all time. i rated it 5 after watching but i'm giving it a 3 now. and i'm pretty sure i'm never gonna complete the second and third films.", "Bravo!

Marlon Brando's speech is imitated, the horse head scene has been poked to death, and the musical score is used in spoofs. Yes, here we have the quissential mafia film. One of the first, and still the best.It started off as a novel written by Mario Puzo, until Francis Ford Coppola came in and expressed his interests of turning it into a film. He took it to Paramount Pictures, and they originally slated it to be a modernized version. They figured it would be much cheaper to make it in the present day (1971) and would hit audiences harder. However, Coppola, along with Puzo, fought them day on end for the rights to leave it as it was. Eventually, they gave in, but gave Coppola even more troubles when they disagreed on practically half of Coppola's cast. Paramount eventually gave into Coppola again, and let him make the film. This film is magnificent in so many ways. Performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, James Caan, and Marlon Brando make the film shine, and also make it some of the best acting ever caught on film. Most people will tell you that The Godfather is every guy's favorite film. I guess you could say that's true for the most part, although I know many women who love this film as well.

Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them!

From casting, directing, storyline and acting, this cinematic masterpiece exceeds every norm of past motion picture experience and creates its own. Up to this day i still strive to find a movie to rival such a magnificent work of art. What ought to be just a Mafia thriller became \"the Mafia Thriller\", imitated up until today by many who wish to follow in the footsteps of this great classic. As for cultural significance, this film does not fall short either. It towers above every other movie in this category which is why i consider it the greatest movie of all time.In fact, it has inspired a generation of mainstream moviegoers and movie aficionados alike. It is a once in a lifetime movie to say the least. Yes, there are other very entertaining movies such as the Shawshank Redemption etc. but many of these failed to cross the boundary of being just a movie nerd flick to mainstream acclaim. The Godfather has captured both sides of the coin, setting it apart from the other cult favorites. It captures a wide range of emotions and characteristics.

The acting is flawless, the story is superb and the director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius.A fascinating movie that I'm sure everyone should love; the tragic way in which Michael Corleone is transformed in a powerful Mafia leader who shows no mercy to anyone in order to keep his family \"in business\"The movie is 3 hours long, but you will be so caught in the action, you won't even notice the time passing by. This is a movie that you can watch once or twice a year without getting bored. I watched it probably 20 times, and every time i watch it I love it more and more... My advice is: Watch This Movie!

This movie has anything you could ask for.": "Sorry for any spelling errors, or past/present writing errors. *****SPOILERS HEREIN******* The greatest film ever made! This movie has anything you could ask for. It has romance, drama, action, and a little comedy. Every scene is memorable in some small way. Amerigo Bonasera and Johnny Fontane both come to the Don with problems that they have. The Don tells both of these men that he will help them out Luca Brasi also gives his thanks to the Don for inviting him to the wedding and he hopes that Connie's first child will be a masculine one. Michael and Kay arrive shortly after the wedding of Carlo Rizzi and Connie Corleone begins. Michael explains to Kay that he doesn't want to be in part with his family business. He also tells her the story of how Johnny Fontane got into a big band but, wanted out of the contract. He couldn't get out so the Don and Luca Brasi went over to the band leader and said that either his brains or his signature would be on the check. After the wedding scene Tom Hagen heads over to Hollywood to talk to the big shot producer, Jack Woltz, about Johnny Fontane being in the new war film. Jack Woltz goes on to explain that he cannot let Johnny be in it because he would be perfect for the part and he made Jack look like a fool. Tom Hagen flies back to New York and then the next night we see the famous horse head in the bed of Jack Woltz. With that Johnny Fontante gets the part for the film. Next Virgi Solozzo comes to the Don saying that he has a proposition; he would need funding and then he would smuggle in drugs. They would then split the money from the profits. The Don explains that the narcotics business is a risky on and he doesn't want to be a part of it. Solozzo doesn't like this and has the Don shot while he exits his office one day. The Don doesn't die but gets seriously injured. Michael and the rest of the family meet up at the house and try to find out who the person inside their family betrayed them. They finally come to the conclusion that Tessio had betrayed them and kill him. Meanwhile Michael heads in to the city to eat dinner with Kay, he then leaves and heads over to the hospital to meet his father. With no one their except for the nurse and the Don, Michael quickly rushes him to another room and stands guard outside of the hospital. Solozzo's men come by in a car but soon realize that someones guarding Vito Corleone so they drive off. Captain Mckulskey doesn't like this so he comes over and slaps Michael on the face. The Corleone family quickly sends over bodyguards to help protect the Don. Later the Corleone family finds out that Luca Brasi has been killed. He was going on a special errand for the Don. He heads over to Solozzo and Tattalgia saying that he is displeased with the Corleone family and wants to go into a new job. The men are not convinced and kill him. Santino, Peter Clemenza, Tom Hagen, and Michael Corleone all figure out how to make the most of the meeting that Solozzo has just called with Michael. They decide that the best choice would be to have Michael gun down Solozzo and Mckluskey. The Corleone's get the location of the restaurant that Michael and Solozzo will meet and plant a gun in one of the bathroom stalls. When they arrive Michael is searched, he then asks permission to goto the bathroom, comes back out with the gun and kills Mckluskey and Solozzo. He then exits and drives away. The newspapers soon flood with headlines of the killing of a Police Captain. Michael has to be deported to Sicily because it's to dangerous for him in America. He meets a woman named Apollonia and marries her. Later one of his bodyguards, Fabrizzio, kills his wife. Michael becomes infuriated but cannot do anything about it. After he is patched back up he gets sent back to America because its safe again for him. Meanwhile in the time Michael stayed at Sicily, the Don had returned home, and Carlo was beating up Connie. Sonny gets really mad and rushes over to try and help Connie. While going to her house, he gets shot by what it seems like hundreds of bullets. The Don is in pain and soon calls a meeting with all of the major families in the United States to call peace between them. When Michael returns home he talks to Kay and they get married. Soon Michael becomes the new Don of the family and heads over to Las Vegas to check out on Freddie, his brother. He also talks to Moe Greene and says that he wants to buy out the casino. After Moe Greene refuses to sell, Michael heads back to New York. We then see a very sad scene where the Don is playing with Michael's child and suddenly gets a heart attack in the garden and dies. The funeral for the Don had a big turnout with many members of other families coming to pay their respects. After that Carlo Rizzi, and Connie Corleone ask Michael if he can become the Godfather of there newborn child. Michael accepts the offer. The next scene is probably the most beautiful in cinematic history. Michael Corleone is having Connie, and Carlo's child baptized while he is also having his capo-regimes, and bodyguards executing the members of other families that have become a threat to him. The movie finally ends with Michael killing Connie's husband, Carlo Rizzi.", "A masterpiece of a movie": "Godfather is one of the best movies i've ever seen, the plot in the movie is perfect and the story thrilling and fantastic.

The movie is way to detailed, half of the stuff in the movie you don't even need to know, the acting was good and I give the storyline a meh. What ruined it all was the length and combining that with the movies boredom ruins it all. I have watched many movies, and I am a movie enthusiast, but this one does not even reach my top 50.

From all of the hype and clout that comes with any conversation that involves \"The Godfather\", I was expecting some real action, from beginning to end, but instead Coppola uses only a few powerful scenes of violence to break up all of the dialogue used to explain what is going on, and the extremely exaggerated editing that adds about an hour and a half of unneeded movie time, which really took me away from the storyline. Not only was this movie to slow, but the writing I think could have been better. From viewing this movie once, I did not get that it was a story about Michael Corleone, it seemed more like a movie composed of typical situations in which gangsters of organized crime historically endured. Nonetheless, this movie was photographed beautifully and that is one thing I can't take away from this disappointment of a movie.", "you should watch it": "this movie has action its an okay movie, on the count of a few actors but most of the actors are good play rollers who take there part and do what they got to do. mean while others do not and just don't care that much. this movie had a lot of enthusiasm, action, adventure, and its based on an old time mafia gang. which is practically why so many people rate so high. its an amazing story based on 5 tribes who want power over the whole city. there is a wise tribe, aggressive tribe, smart tribe, poor tribe, and a rich tribe. these five families have different ways of surviving and gaining trust over the other 4.due to an overwhelm of one taking to much land it causes trouble. so that's when the action begins to happen. so i would highly recommend this movie to all who want to watch it or just want to know what its about.", "Cinematic Beauty": "How is it possible for a gangster film to bring a tear to one's eye?I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film, although every time it leaves me overwhelmed. The first thing which makes this film, for me, is the music; its genuine authenticity, being scored by a genuine Italian maestro, is unmistakable which, together with its stunning cinematography, gives the film its true and honest character. Beyond this, the storyline is excellent, although it does help to watch the film more than once given the extensive character list. On top of this, the cast is simply outstanding, each perfectly suited and giving clear distinction and definition to their character and each delivering a performance which they have surely not surpassed in their respective careers. It is easy to single out Pacino, Brando and Caan as the standout performances, each of which are excellent, however the supporting roles are equally impressive and go beyond support, sharing the intricacies of each character, their inter- relationships and their moral struggles in the face of organised crime and family values.Without wanting to give anything away, the closing scene is, in my opinion, one of the best moments in cinema.Quite simply, this is not a \"gangster film\".

The only thing that no-one could ever pinch from The Godfather, and make it look better, is waking up to find the bloody-head of a horse, sleeping with you in your bed.The philosophy plays a big part of the film and provides its unique blend of characters with great depth. We also see a great zoom-in shot when Michael (Pacino) devises a plan to assassinate a mafia boss, that killed his father (Brando) and the dishonorable who Michael seeks revenge for receiving a black eye from him. Here we see the good, young Michael take his very first step into the world of terror, that follows him for the rest of trilogy.

The story and acting is impeccable. Of course you can see that this movie is not made this Century, but that just adds to the (call it) charm of this movie. Like Sopranos this is more about Family than the violence and mob.A genius introduction to the main characters are made. The movie starts with a wedding of Don Corleones daughter. Even if it take some time it never gets boring, and after the introduction you already know a lot of the characters in the movie. This is lacking in many modern movies. They do not use enough effort in the character building, it looses to the need of action.

Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment.

The reason why I believe that this scene could have done better, was because the lighting may have worked in some instances such as trying to create an eerie lighting effect.

They quote lines from it.It is not just a gangster movie.It's about family,loyalty,betrayal,power and so much more.This film has a story which will seem relevant even after 100 years. Michael's transformation into Don Corleone is probably the best film about rise to power ever put on camera.Above all the movie is served by some powerhouse performances : Al Pacino,Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall.Basically this film has all things a classic needs to be a GOAT(greatest of all time).", "One of the bests": "Its a kind of movie that you can not replace it, you can replace it with only another two parts\ud83d\ude42", "A visceral yet real portrayal of Italian-Mafia.": "The Godfather is 170 minutes of excruciating realism in the virtually intoxicating world of Italian Mafia - every detail is picked upon, every emotion is explored with fine resolution - it is a masterpiece.Francis Ford Coppola cleverly insinuates an inherent evil in all his characters, weaving a sense of fear in the audience through every frame as he skilfully employs his overwhelming background score to amplify the significance of every transition. Marlon Brando is impeccable in his intimidating yet layered performance as the Don, but it is truly Al Pacino who heightens the picture as the viewer feasts on his electrifying rise from an innocent, patriotic soldier, to the head of the Corleone family.There are numerous thrilling set pieces throughout the film that resonate profoundly towards the audience through their eminent grandeur, such as the Baptism killings, the Sollozzo assassination and the brutal murder of Sonny. However, amongst these iconic scenes of visceral brilliance are the character arcs that truly touch the viewer, including Michael's subtle romance when taking refuge in Sicily, as the audience indulges in the glorious beauty of Italian culture, or even the domestic predicaments that Connie has to painfully bear, which the audience takes to heart.Ultimately, it is the homely, yet threatening physiognomy of The Godfather which makes it the perfect gangster film, one which should never be missed.", "One of my favorites!": "I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites.

The ONLY spoiler I will reveal is that, let me tell you, you're in for a wild ride. If you are into gore, this is a wonderful, wonderful feature length film and I would highly recommend it.

Al Pacino, for example, who succeeded in turning into a cold-blooded mafia leader, or Marlon Brando, a charismatic figure and very family-like who succeeded in playing the leader of the mafia network, who was wise in making decisions, is also the main attraction of this film. But what was more surprising from Marlon Brando was his expression, I don't know how he formed an iconic facial expression.But in my opinion, there is something missing from this film. As others say, this film is sometimes boring. The time used for one scene is too long. The most important thing, at least for me, is the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the policeman.

Both men completely disappear into their roles, transforming Mario Puzo's characters into pop culture icons.

The film was as powerful and beautiful full size as you would expect, but what really struck me was the viewer reactions.Many people in the audience were seeing the film for the first time and a lot of scenes which I remember as being downright chilling or foreboding got laughs.  Granted there are some genuinely funny moments in The Godfather (\"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\" \"We don't talk business at the table.\"), but there were some laughs at what would be considered some very inappropriate places.For instance, the infamous horsehead in the bed got some chuckles.  When the scene of the house fades to Don Corleone, it gets an outright belly laugh. I really don't remember this as being funny.  Also, the scene in Sicily where Michael's bodyguard leaves so skittishly, forecasting some bad things happening to Michael's car... outright laughter.The American viewing audience has changed since 1972.  I don't believe that these scenes were intended to illicit laughter, and I would guess they did not when the film was released.

I don't know the exact contribution Coppola made to the screenplay (both he and Puzo are credited), but in some scenes the actors were reading Puzo's original lines direct. And with good reason: they simply couldn't be bettered.Clearly, the entire cast had studied the book well; I admired the way they subtly wove in much of the character development explicitly dealt with in the book but (largely) left out of the screenplay: Sonny's warm-heartedness and genuine brotherly love for Michael; Luca Brasi's monstrous reputation; Don Corleone's tendency towards peasant simplicity; and on it goes. I urge those of you who have seen and admired the movie but who have not yet read the book, get hold of a copy; surely no other movie bears quite this relationship to the novel that preceded it.", "Not many words": "Two words, absolutely perfect.

Watching this movie we make jokes and start imitating the characters: \"act like a man!\" Hehe, great!", "What makes it so good?": "What makes this movie so good? It's, most fundamentally, and perhaps most subtly, that rich, full, religious-like piety (the kind that's earnest) that it exhibits, for the family, for loyalty in general, for a kind of life of crime that inspires reverence for the criminals rather than condemnation, as if somehow these criminals are martyrs who must do all the dirty work while protecting, or at least pretending to protect, their family and others from it. The movie has a belief in honor and tradition\u0097it also has a strong belief in power, though, a commitment to it. The respect for family in these movies is inexorably connected to the inconspicuous (or perhaps conspicuous)celebration of Don Corleone and his son Michael \"doing what it takes,\" acting illicitly as a kind of sacrifice, out of manly volition; in this aspect Michael and his father are like Fortinbras as opposed to Hamlet; by acting decisively they answer Hamlet's \"to be or not to be[?]\" with a firm \"to be.\" When they reflect they are more like Hamlet himself, though they do not match Hamlet's scope of thought, but the movie supplies that missing profundity with the diffusive effect which is common to all films as inspired as this one: the look is just right, the pace, the music, the blocking and the photography in general.", "Best Movie in the history": "God father is the one of the best outstanding movie i have ever seen", "Super Good": "Very good movie ive watched it 10000000 timesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss", "All the time": "This movie is the best movies, I have seen forever.

Quite toned down, no over the top action, but the gradual transformation of Michael into a mafia boss, despite his intent not to become one. An important scence in the beginning, from the wedding, has come to symbolize the type of relationship-based culture for me. Bonasera has been avioding the mob for a long time, but now that his daugther was assaulted, he needs their help. He comes and asks for help, offering money. The Godfather refuses - he does not want money, we wants respect. Debt precedes money as a social institution, according to Graeber. The original way of functioning in an economy was local and very trust-based. These types of institutions, together with a well-developed honor codex are very prevalent in the mafia culture. The gracious, private, inconspicuous nature of the mafia, and their honor of their word are central to their role in society.The story touches on the American dream. I believe in America. America has made my fortune. Bonasera tells Don Vito who knows well enough that Bonasera earned his financial success through legal means, being a man of integrity and with faith in the American judicial system. Like a good American? who has assimilated in the American way of life, Bonasera raised his daughter in the American fashion and gave her freedomonasera uses the American Dream and tries to live in it, relish in it, and bask in the glory of it.

It's a world full of traditions, family values, rich and explicit verbal and behavior language, but also a world of corruption, power, deceit and murder. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to create this Italian-American feeling throughout the whole movie, and it never feels superficial. It's a very good movie, but not extra-ordinary. I lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son Michael being dragged into the world of the mafia. It was a bit too easy. He gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop, and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody. I think I miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic. Anyway, trying to keep The Godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre.

I recommend it for everyone. Watched this movie in school for one of my class and since have watched it multiple times", "agreed": "\"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, \"Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?\" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to \"11\" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of \"oscillating\" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) \"zoom out\" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film. \" I completely agree", "Imbeciles": "A friend of mine and I were arguing as to the greatest film of all time and he sent me to this site to see what the idiots (all 250k of em) here had decided was the best pic.

Expectation the movie sees in your eyes, then laughs at you for some minutes. And then a man wakes up with blood all over his pajamas and a horse head in his bed. So you realise that something you were simply fearing is actually true. That is the complex life of the Corleone family.But please, try ignoring your expectations. Forget about the hype, as many describe this as one of the \"greatest movies of all time\", if not THE one. You won't be disappointed, that is, but there is nothing like a \"greatest\" movie. This is \"only\" a masterpiece in cinematographic production, acting, writing and score, much akin to an opera piece.\"The Godfather\" does not care about classical Aristotelian unity, and it can do that thanks to an incredibly coherent screenplay thanks to the combined effort of writer Mario Puzo and director F.F. Coppola. Years pass by, oceans are crossed and decisions are taken without the viewers noticing, as they can't ignore every character's intriguing motivations and cold-hearted yet realistic resolution. This is one of the greatest strenghts of the movie, as its surrealisticly realistic tone constantly entangles your brain in its world: you always know that all you are watching is just fiction, only a story, yet it impossible for the viewer to unsee the cruel nature of a world that did exist. Its a \"historical character saga\" about nonexistent characers.Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's performances have no particular traints of features. Because they are flawless. The supporting cast did a great job too, so good in fact that most of the time you can't tell who is the supporting and who's the main cast.Gordon Willis' fotography is gorgeous from the first moments of the movie. Slowly moving scenes, beautifully lit like Caravaggio's portraits, bring a whole new life to the words \"noir\" and \"chiaroscuro\". We are talking about Italians, after all, and making Marlon Brando mumble some \"italian\" words sure does not mean a lot. Still, it was nice to hear Italian words pronounced correctly almost all the time.Nino Rota did not write music. The sophisticated sounds you hear while your eyes are accompanied by the splendidly crafted frames are powerful overflows of emotions. Nino Rota was truly a prodigy and a master of his art.But how are all these different features kept toghether in this masterpiece of a movie? It's a slow and steady descent into darkness, just look at Al Pacino's character, Michele Corleone.\nSo, what happens if you finally step into chaos?\nWell, you won't like it. Your life won't like it. Your loved ones won't like it.\nBut you won't even notice.", "Spoilers": "In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes.\" Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie, and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home, but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gun fire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito agrees Tom should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signaling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, Peter Clemenza, garrotes Carlo with a wire. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her.", "EPIC": "The trilogy is an EPIC MOVIE.

Loyalty is key and you find yourself, as with any good gangster film, becoming loyal to the characters, or the family introduced, in this case the Corleone's. Coppola's time frame is clear from the beginning, it is set with Micheal's army uniform from world war two, which allows a certain amount of historical l context to be conveyed without being explicit.

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.", "A classical classic. Recommend": "One of my favorite movies of all time. Especially is a recommended for watching, if you like the vibe of mafia stories.The film deeply immerses you in the atmosphere of the mafia. Many different aspects of their lives, and the code of honor, are beautifully covered.Interesting arc of the main character.Unsurpassed performance of the main cast.The atmosphere of the film keeps you in suspense from the beginning to the end, at the same time swinging on an emotional swing. The attitude towards the characters changes several times throughout the film.The characters and their motivation are interestingly written.", "This classic inferior to GoodFellas.": "The Godfather Part I deserves to be seen for what it is, not what its reputation is or what Part II added to it.  With that in mind, my review: The first 2 hours are rather aimless, shabbily edited to look like a discordant bunch of too-thoughtfully-crafted \"moments\" without a common center.  The actors' portrayals, while very strong throughout the cast, frequently overshadow what they are talking about.  I tend to think that the story is usually the most important and interesting part of films, but here it is put on the backburner by, dare I say, too rich character-development. Actually, is that what it was?  I come away from it without any true understanding of Michael's motivations or concept of morals, or why he chose to totally ignore them in the pursuit of power.  I often felt that Don Corleone himself, who is not in the film as much as one might expect, is also hidden behind his own famous mannerisms and the reputation that goes along with being the Godfather.  Having said that, the last hour, with Michael as the new head of the family, finally gains a focus and becomes interesting.  The cross-cutting of the christening and the murders was perfectly masterful and thrilling.  However, how the film morphed into Michael's story (and how he himself morphed into the cold blooded killer) is rather abrupt and unconvincing, though I am grateful for the change in tone.Most importantly, it is inferior to GoodFellas, and thus can't even stake a claim as the best film of its genre.", "Friend really likes it so i watched it.": "Great movie maybe a flawless one. I went in with expectation, I came out with the expectation's surpassed.", "this is the best of all Hollywood movies ever": "this is always the TOP.excellent movie in Hollywood industry .Pacino rocks.if anybody thinks this is a long one then they are not worth of seeing this movie.three and half hours of excellence in all including cinematography,screenplay,music and climax is awesome.nice movie of all times. its worth as it still in 2 ND place even after this long time . even though its from book, the way of expressing as movie is very very difficult which is excellently done by Francis ford Coppola. greatest movie of all time.and the second and third part of this movie are also nice movies .but first always stands first.its truly the masterpiece.as long as its length , there is no boring scene in this movie when compared to other long movies", "The best of movie all time": "The best all time marlon branda and al pacino best actors", "best mafia movie ever made": "I really adore this type of movies and i watched a lot of them but the godfather movie is an exception its soo much different how they build the characters the environment the story and the most amazing thing was the dialogue its just so great i cant even expect any movie in this period to compete with this piece of art", "The GodFather": "\"I will make you an offer you cannot refuse.\" said by Don Vito Corleone in The GodFather.Well the setting of this intense movie is in New York where all the big 5 families or 5 different mafia families live in... The movie starts off in New York but slowly the setting moves to several different places in the United States. For example California and Las Vegas are two places where the Corleone family went to make deals with people. First of all i have to say the roles of the characters were played very well especially how the godfather uses he's accent and the way he acts in he's role makes it seem more realistic to how most people think of the mafia. I also think that Al Pacino did a very good job in playing the role of his character making him seem like a man who is not interested in the family business but has to step up to take revenge and take control of the family so that he's family members will not die. The costumes that the characters dress in suited the setting very well because the setting was not modern, but was in the past. Also the way people in each setting acted represented a lot like how much people would act when someone was killed because most people would be scared to get interfered with the mafia families. i think that this film is a very well directed and acted film and is a movie that must be seen because it is almost an once in a life time experience that can change one's thinking of what goes on in the world. As must one say the old clich\u00e9 \"smell the flowers.\" (notice little things around you)", "Second Best": "I thought three was the best of the pictures.

From the opening of the movie to the baptism scene. Every scene has value to it. Francis Ford Coppola almost did not make a masterpiece at all. The production company refused to have Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in the movie and look how that turned out. Michael Corleone is the greatest character to rise to power.", "Smoothed empathy": "I watched that movie like I read a brilliant book. The plot (despite its simplicity) keeps your interest up all along. So, one should not be discouraged by its length.The director does a perfect job at dealing with the characters, not too clich\u00e9, not too bland. They are, with their fate, the ones triggering the watcher's feelings and anchoring his empathy which makes the movie so subtle. Even one who disdains any mafia romanticism could enjoy!Finally, the outstanding quality of the photography smooths the watcher's entering in the story.

His first appearance in the movie has completely conquered the audience. He is a unique godfather.\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola also arranged the story very well.

Folks think that Citizen Kane is the greatest Motion picture at any time produced...perfectly, there's no way that ANYONE can believe Citizen Kane is a lot more moving, and it has a greater storyline compared to the Godfather.

Perhaps not knowing how successful this movie was helped , i watched the movie  without knowing it 's background or having read Mario Puzo's bestselling book . Instead i happen to see the Last Don before seeing this movie . The movie haunts you long after u have finished seeing it whether it 's the godfather theme or Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's ground - breaking performances ( who could he lose to at the oscars in the best supporting actor category ? ) .Until now , there are very few gangster moives that make use of so few expletives , it 's amazing even in the 70's it gives credit to the script for creating an impact without using forceful language. The ideal of the film is what stands out that the youngest son in the family underestimated from day one saves the family when they are close to being destroyed by the other families .Although it's Micheal Corleone who holds centre - stage towards the second half of this movie and the subsequent two sequels .I feel that it 's really vito corleone who is the stand -out character of the series played by both Brando and De Niro (both earning oscars ) . In conclusion , There is no doubt this is the greatest movie of all time , very few can match this movie except for probably it 's sequel PT-II was brillant as well , but still could not match up to it's predecessor .So , there's no doubt that it 's the most watched movie of all time and will continue to be for some time to come . just can't wait to get my hands on the DVD version .", "I did not care for The Godfather!": "Did not care for The Godfather.

In the established business and the influence divided between the Fathers, a new source of income appears - drug trafficking. It promises fantastic incomes and promises those who agree to do it, the possibility of sole power. However, this new business has a number of drawbacks: by making profits, it scares off politicians and the police, who will not be as easy to buy as in the case of gambling houses or alcohol. In addition, some heads of families are disgusted by the sale of deadly powder. \"It's a dirty business\" (c).The situation is developing into a counteraction, some families are negative towards the drug business, and seek to restrain it so as not to go bankrupt, other families see the future in the drug business and are ready to deal with it closely. Someone stays on the sidelines, someone enters the war. An interesting character - a Turk, a drug dealer - suspiciously similar to Efim Shifrin, serves as a catalyst in the massacre, pushes those who want to do business with him to eliminate those who want to limit his business in America. The fragile peace is broken by a whiff of power and greed. \"I am a man of a new generation\" (c).In a three-hour film adaptation of this story, dressed in authentic (most likely) Italian traditions, Puzo and Coppola managed to show not only and not so much the history of the war of families, but the history of the people of the family. Despite the fact that the history of the war does not seem to be any, not supplemented or not disclosed, everything is in its place here, optimally woven into a leisurely plot, saturated with a cruel atmosphere of logical murders, when nothing personal, just business. Just money.I seem to have forgotten to praise the actors' acting, directing? Well, God be with them.The best mafia movie.", "IMDB TOP 100": "Wow this movie was really that great, i hope for who doesnt watch this film you must watch this movie.

It has a great and deep message.

I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.", "One of the greatest movies": "The Godfather is one of my favorites.

The production quality and cinematography are as expected - fantastic, epic and awe inspiring, aside from a couple of excessively dark scenes that were over and done with very quickly.There is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and depravity. Incidental background humor. A promise of things to come.The casting seems to be on point - I saw no issue with any of the characters, and the leads were well chosen for their roles.The writing seems to be up to par.

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul.

I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

It doesn't rely on constant, needless, high-speed action. Something almost impossible to do for a 3 hour runtime. Instead, the slow progression of a character's transformation. It's a beautiful thing that few get right, but The Godfather absolutely nails it.Everything simply just \"works\", from the story, casting, themes, cinematography, music, etc. So many aspects come together to make one extraordinary, poetic film.

The general public has heaped praises on her for the good heart.", "An offer so good": "The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it.Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.", "You can only rate this a pure 10": "A perfect movie. Everything is well written and acting is on point. Even after so many years, it's still one of the best movies ever created and it will stay like that for a long time!", "How much i like it?": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.", "Never take sides against the family.": "One of the greatest films of all time, a true masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, as well as the film that established the standard.In the story, the Mafia is seen from within. That is its secret, allure, and spell; it has shaped how the general public perceives the Mafia ever since. In place of the real world, there is an authoritarian patriarchy ruled by the Godfather, with betrayers as the only bad guys. Michael (Al Pacino) gave the following advice: \"Never take sides against the family.\" The Godfather traces the arc of this doomed idealism with a beauty that is still fresh.", "The Godfather so well": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. I love and watch every month at least once.Winner of 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather is one of the most revered movies of all time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.....", "Must watch movie!!": "The work changes the audience's perception of crime movies, especially the gangster series. Before that, the term \"mafia\" was unfamiliar to Hollywood. Crime themes often revolve around murders and detective investigations that end with evil being brought to light. From 1930 to 1968, Will Hays - the late president of the MPAA (American Motion Picture Association) - applied Hays law, requiring movies not to depict in detail criminal acts such as murder, theft, robbery, etc. The director must not tell a crime story with a point of view that empathizes with or inspires imitations.The Godfather - on the contrary - is built with the fighting scenes of the underworld, boldly violent. Many scenes are R-rated (restricted to audiences under 17) like when a character wakes up to find himself lying next to a horse's head, bed covered in fresh blood. The other became a target for the whole gang, his body covered with bullet holes. The story of the film continues with mass shootings, cars exploding on the road, the characters finishing the enemy with all kinds of tricks. Such as strangulation, stealth shooting, assassination...Not stopping at building the criminal world, Coppola and the original novelist Puzo co-created a work that made viewers think about the nature of good and evil. The gangsters are not necessarily bad, the police are not necessarily all good. Don Vito impresses with his experience, every word uttered is as weighty as drawn from many years of experience in the world of wanderlust. Michael from a gentle young man, because of the twist of fate that gradually metamorphosed.", "Very good movie to watch and share with your family": "The reviewers on this site have already done a fantastic job of articulating the many reasons why The Godfather is so great, so I won't try. I've watched some great movies and some real stinkers, but none can compare to The Godfather. Since watching it for the first time barely nine hours ago, so many specifics and situations have been bouncing around in my thoughts. There isn't a single thing wrong with The Godfather; in fact, it's so well-made and played that I'm having a hard time coming up with a decent enough excuse for why I hadn't seen it sooner.Although The Godfather's pacing and reveal of its story might drag at times, these are hardly fatal shortcomings. The Godfather's slow pacing lent the film an air of melancholy, and the film's unique plot stems from the fact that you have almost no idea where it will go next. Even though I was concerned that I might not comprehend this film because of my young age (18), I found that it made perfect sense to me and that I am now able to appreciate it as the masterpiece that it is.For one, The Godfather has a gorgeous visual style. Despite the previous reviewer's assertions to the contrary, I found the film's cinematography to be among its strongest points. The cinematography and lighting in certain situations is gloomy and mysterious, while in others, like the wedding, they are lush and colorful (think autumnal foliage) and quite lovely. The cinematography in The Godfather isn't the only thing that makes everything look so good, though; the clothing, sets, and vehicles are all exquisite as well.", "Best mafia movie ever": "I have always loved mafia movies like Goodfellas but The Godfather trilogy is just so much better. Marlon Brando is just amazing and the other actors (especially Al Pacino and James Caan) are also really good. The film is very long but it didn't bother me and it certainly isn't boring like some people have said. Much of the length is caused because Coppola put great care into making his characters seem \"real\". And concentrating on the family rather than the crime business, Coppola and Puzo put an amazing depth into the characters.Simply put: The best mafia movie ever.", "So good its Goodfather": "This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.

Let's not forget Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzzo who had a big role in this movie's success beside the actors performance. The movie shows almost every aspect of life switching from emotion to tragedy in a unique way , as the same with the characters witch is Michaels case , changing from a loving young man and uninterested of power to a man that is unflinching in his belief. That in one word : Breathtaking", "Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions": "Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them.

The film, a sequel to the original The Godfather, is a masterpiece of storytelling and acting, and it remains one of the most highly regarded films of all time.The Godfather Part II picks up where the first film left off, with the character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) now fully entrenched as the head of the family. The film follows two parallel storylines: one set in the present, where Michael is dealing with the challenges of running a criminal empire, and another set in the past, where we see the early years of Michael's father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), as he builds his own criminal empire.One of the things that makes The Godfather Part II so special is the performances of the cast. Pacino and De Niro give career-defining performances as Michael and Vito, respectively, and their chemistry on screen is electric. The rest of the cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and Lee Strasberg.The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the first Godfather film. Coppola's direction is impeccable, and he perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the film. The cinematography is also top-notch, with beautiful shots of New York City and Havana adding to the overall visual appeal of the film.Overall, The Godfather Part II is a must-see film for any fan of the crime genre. Its compelling story, top-notch acting, and beautiful visuals make it a true masterpiece of cinema. It's a film that has stood the test of time and remains just as powerful and relevant today as it was when it was first released.", "The Godfather is Very Exclusive Movie": "The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty in postwar New York City transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant youngest son. Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented Laurence Olivier in terms of esteem. Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented Laurence Olivier in terms of esteem. Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando.", "Another kind of family movie": "I recently watched The Godfather and it was an incredible movie. It had me captivated from the beginning to the end. The plot was intriguing, with plenty of suspense and unexpected twists. The acting was top notch, with Al Pacino giving a stellar performance as Don Corleone. The cinematography was beautiful, creating the perfect atmosphere for this classic gangster film. I was captivated by the acting and the way the film was shot. It was also very suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat. There were moments that had me laughing, crying and everything in between. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging and unforgettable experience.", "My Favorite Film": "The Godfather was one of the first \"classic\" films I ever watched, and even after viewing other highly regarded films (On the Waterfront, Raging Bull, Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Third Man) it remains my favorite.  Although it may not be the greatest film of all time (that honor goes to Citizen Kane), there will always be a special place in my heart for The Godfather.  The seamlessness of the story and the richness of the distinct characters make it such an enjoyable film to watch that I am in awe every time I view it.  I have watched it in whole or in parts dozens of times, and it is simply one film that I will never tire of.", "Nice film": "I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice.

The only realistic thing about this movie is that the mafia spends most of its time sitting, eating and talking. 'The irishman' was long too but it was entertaining and didn't make me want to put a hit out on myself after watching it.", "My Best all time movie": "\"The Godfather\" (1972) is a timeless classic that has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is a masterful epic that explores the inner workings of a powerful Mafia family in New York City. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and follows the aging patriarch of the Corleone family, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), as he tries to maintain his power and protect his family from the various threats that come their way.What makes \"The Godfather\" so exceptional is its exceptional cast of characters. Each actor brings their own unique charm and charisma to the screen, creating a rich tapestry of personalities that are both fascinating and compelling. Marlon Brando delivers a standout performance as Vito Corleone, delivering one of the most iconic performances in film history. He brings a quiet strength and vulnerability to the role, making him one of the most memorable characters in cinema. The supporting cast, including James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton, are equally impressive, adding depth and nuance to the film.One of the hallmarks of \"The Godfather\" is its memorable dialogue, which is rich with meaning and nuance. The film's dialogue is often quoted and has become part of popular culture, and it is a testament to the film's power and impact. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is also an integral part of the film's success. The music sets the mood and underscores the film's themes of family, loyalty, and power, making it an unforgettable experience.The cinematography of \"The Godfather\" is also worthy of praise. The film's visual style is stunning, with richly saturated colors and sweeping vistas that capture the grandeur and majesty of the world of the Corleone family. The film's editing is seamless, moving from scene to scene with a fluid grace that keeps the viewer engaged and invested in the story.In conclusion, \"The Godfather\" is a true masterpiece of filmmaking. It is a film that transcends time and remains as relevant and impactful today as it was over 50 years ago. It is a film that is both a cultural touchstone and a testament to the power of cinema to tell stories that resonate with audiences of all ages.

You won't regret it.", "The GodFather Review": "\"The Godfather\" is a classic movie that will have you in stitches... from laughter! This film is a true testament to the comedic talents of Marlon Brando, who absolutely steals the show as the lovable gangster, Vito Corleone. From his over-the-top facial expressions to his hilarious one-liners, you won't be able to stop giggling.But it's not just Brando who will have you in stitches. The supporting cast is full of hilarious characters, including the bumbling and often confused Tom Hagen, the unpredictable and hot-headed Sonny, and the comically evil Sollozzo.The film's script is also full of comedic gold, with lines like \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse... to join the clown college\" and \"Leave the gun. Take the cannolis.\"Overall, \"The Godfather\" is a film that will have you laughing out loud and rethinking your stance on organized crime. Don't miss it!", "Awesome Or Perfect?": "Al Pacino,James Caan,Marlon Brando,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton...just perfect.Not only that it has the greatest actors ever,its story is perfect too.Before the movie was even made one of the greatest actors auditioned for the casts.Did you know that Elvis wanted to play Michael Corleone? Even the music is perfect for the movie.Larry Kusic and Nino Rota composed the music for the movie.You need to have The love theme.Really Great.Through the years Godfather got famous and even more.Everybody knows the movie,the actors,even the game which got released in 2006 (don't got it but maybe someday).I recommend this movie to everybody who is into Crime,Drama,...and everybody who loves the acting of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.", "Doesn't deserves 9.2": "I don't think this movie deserves 9.2. It is a boring family drama movie, no doubt the actors were one of the best but overall the movie is super bore and normal crime/drama movie. But again I'll say the cast was superb.\nJust see shawshank redemption, it's a masterpiece and godfather just doesn't deserve to be so close to shawshank", "The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time.": "I have seen it four times and have enjoyed it every single time. In fact if I could only watch three movies for the rest of my life, this would be it along with to Kill A Mockingbird and American Beauty.There are many things that make this movie enjoyable so many things that I have to break it down.The plot. There are few American movies that have a plot as deep and complex as the Godfather. Usually when I don't want to spend 6 dollars to see a movie I'll just go to a website and read a recap, but with this it is impossible. There are more twists and turns then a hamster maze. In fact the first time I watched this I had to pause every 20 minutes just to take in what I was seeing.It delivers what it promises. With 90 percent of today's movies they promise something big and epic, only to fail to deliver. The Godfather sets up high expectations and meets them all and then some. It is impossible to say this movie is over rated, because there isn't a scale in the world that can rate a movie such as this.The characters. Just as a captain is nothing without his crew a movie is nothing without its characters and this movie has some of the most memorable. I cannot possibly have a favorite because they are all incredible. Clearly when casting they chose the best and not the ones that looked good and had six packs.The dialogue. Very few movies have realistic dialogue. They sound rehearsed and forced, but this movie is the exception. The actors were speaking as if this was real life and they were having a realistic conversation. If I didn't know this was a movie I would think that someone had recorded an actual person's life.The action. I won't deny it, I love action and this movie does not fail. The fight scenes were epic and unpredictable. One moment a family could be sitting down to a nice dinner and the next minute machine gun fire could be going everywhere. My personal favorite was when Emilio Barzini was shot and rolled down the stairs.This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. This is one of the few movies that can please everyone. It has action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, a deep plot, and a feeling of satisfaction after you see it. If you haven't seen this movie do so as soon as possible this is one film that you can't refuse.", "very good but not the best movie of all time": "I finally got around to seeing this movie.  I highly recommend it for reasons I'm sure the many other reviewers have already voiced.  In particular, Marlon Brando gives one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen.On the other hand, it didn't quite live up to the billing as best picture of all time and was not flawless as many claim it to be...  I had two major problems with the Godfather.  First, even thought the movie is three hours long I felt that the character of Michael was still underdeveloped. Michael's \"transformation\" is the focal point of the movie, yet we see almost nothing of him in the first third of the movie and we can't really tell how much of an internal change he makes.  Leaving a little mystery and leaving things up to interpretation is fine but I thought this was a bit extreme.Second, the female characters were one-dimensional, naive and passive to the point of incredulity.  Take for example the scene between Michael and Kay after Michael returns from his absence -- oh come on!Despite these qualms, it was still very enjoyable and something that everyone should probably watch at least once.  My rating: 8.5 out of 10", "The Greatest Film Ever Made!": "The Godfather is a true definition of great filmaking.  Unbelieveable acting by Marlon Brando, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, and of course Al Pacino. The story itself is unlike any other I have ever seen.  Landmark! Simply Landmark!  It really invented a new genre of Mafia films.

It is a big film with big themes, has memorable characters and lines. Mario Puzo novel once again proves that he's the master of storytelling \u2014 and Francis Ford Coppola of thrillingly violent filmmaking. With its all star cast this should go straight to the head of the list of essential viewing. With a classic sequel also to view. You will rarely get it so good.Makes Bernard Mungeam 5 star films", "A truly excellent drama about a life of a mafia family": "Today a very well known movie and for me the best ever. The story is based on the novel -The Godfather- from which the movie obviously got its name and it follows the most part of the story in the novel. The cast is also excellent the stars who play each character fit their role in the movie perfectly. Some parts of the story may become confusing to some audience if they don't pay much attention to the movie, i found the movie more interesting when i watched it the 3rd time because I had missed some tiny details which make this movie so good. The story won't become boring, it keeps you watching the movie all the time because you really want to know what will happen next which is quite rare in many movies. The effects are also done well for the 70's period, they look very realistic. The movie really gives you a good description of that dark period in history in a non boring way.Those who enjoy watching drama will love this movie.", "Just Wow": "An American classic, and one of the greatest film's ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The film chronicles a ten year span (1945 to 1955) in the life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family of New York City.It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. The greatest gangster film ever made. Coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail\"must see\" masterpiece.", "Greatest mob movie ever?": "Perhaps the greatest film of all time.  Atleast in it's genre.  This is the film that started the career of Al Pacino and made a legend of Marlon Brando.  Director, Francis Ford Copolla shows how stunningly beautiful violence can be in film.  Also how we the viewer can see a little bit of ourselves in the twisted underground realm where passion and tragedy go hand in hand.", "Best movie ever made!": "Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia.", "Perfect, but just lacks that special touch.": "There is no doubt that The Godfather is one of the cinematic experiences of all time. The Godfather is perfect, and there is no denying that. A story which excites and threats, acting which is convincing on every level and shot in a unique style- so why not 10? For me a 10 movie has to be perfect and mean something to me- this film is perfect but with the wealth of characters and its popularity takes away that special edge. To make a perfect film is an achievement, to make a perfect film with another touch is near impossible. I've only ever once offered a film 10/10 and The Godfather won't be my second. That said, still a brilliant piece of work. 9/10.", "The Best Film EVER Made.": "I absolutely LOVE this movie! This is my personal favorite. Everything in this film works perfectly.First off, the acting. It's as though the actors were born for the roles. Especially everyone in the Corleone family... you find they act totally like a family. The best performance for me was Brando as Vito Corleone. He brought such a presence to the character that it's astonishing... basically unbelievable. The rest of the cast does a great job. Al is extremely convincing as the youngest son of the don. The only thing people have to realize is that the mafia in no way act like this. I mean, \"The Godfather\" is a very romantic or Shakespearean look at this world. Even though all the characters DO eventually pay for their sins. Francis Ford Coppola once said \"I always thought of THE GODFATHER as the story of a great king with three sons. The oldest was given his sweet nature and childlike qualities; the second, his passion and aggressiveness; and the third, his cunning and coolness.\"I wholeheartedly agree.", "The God of all movies.": "A ten by far. One of the greatest pieces of film ever to be created. Nothing can compare to it's magnitude. Perfect. Brando's greatest performance along with Pacino and Coppola. Like it's title it is the \"Godfather\" of all films. A template for all films to follow.", "The Greatest picture in the history of film": "This movie is beyond words. It is motion picture history. I remember the first time i saw it. I was captivated by it's magical realism. I was swept away. What i saw was poetry in motion. At that moment i knew there will never be a movie as perfect as this. All movies should be compared to this. Artistically, technically and emotionally it is simply untouchable.", "Worst movie ever": "First i thought that The men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this..... VERY bad movie. I don't care how many people gave it a 10 (don't know why). I want to write my opinion. It is long, boring, a lot of talking, a lot families, names, doing \"buissnes\".... Did i mention that it is boring? The movie lacks a good storyline. It doesn't matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all. There is no comedy, there is very little action, drama (here and there somebody gets killed). I had better fun watching politicians than this.I just wasted 6 hours of my life. (together with the second part)Better watch Scarface, Casino or Reservoir Dogs. My other movies are Braveheart, Gladiator, Shawshank, Lethal weapon, Black hawk down....", "At the funeral scene there is a woman on Michael's jacket. It looks like the sunlight at first then you can see her if you pause the movie.": "The scene at the funeral Michael is sitting down talking and the woman appears on his shoulder. When he goes to stand up, another woman appears on the same side. It is very quick and the movie can be paused to see it clear. If you have a DVD you can pause it and fast forward very slow and you can see the first woman open her eyes and smile. Has anyone ever noticed this or is it apart of the movie. If you have not please watch the movie and tell me anything you know about it. It was very weird and my family and i just noticed it last night and we really would like to know what it might be or mean. We don't know if it was a mistake made in the movie or if the woman was meant to be in it. If anyone has any information on this please let us know. If you look very close you can tell that the woman you see at first is different from the second. It is very easily mistaken for the sunlight. She is there through the whole conversation but not as clear when Michael leans forward and she is on the dark part of his jacket. When you watch this make sure the whole time your watching the funeral scene you watch it slow as possible. It very easy to miss. PLease comment when you see it!!!! Thank you", "Speechless": "the godfather is by far the best movie i have ever seen along with the godfather part 2 the first time i saw the godfather i was nothing but speechless it was so good i thought i was dreaming i couldn't believe how perfect the movie was it was so perfect i had to watch it a second time just to make sure i wasn't dreaming and its true i wasn't dreaming i am telling you the godfather is the best movie ever made if you do not own this movie or have never seen it i highly recommend that you do you from the way everything happens to the way the story paces it is a masterpiece in every way i just can not say enough about it heck i liked it so much i sold one of my favorite games just so i could have the money to buy the collection so i could see number 2&3 the godfather is a true cinematic masterpiece and nothing but a masterpiece", "Flawless!": "Watched it as a kid, reviewed it later! Masterpiece!", "i think": "This movie is one of the best movies i seen, great actors, we liked the bad people and this was the most negative part.", "Chef d'oeuvre in the history of cinematography": "I watched the movie for the first time yesterday. I have heard about it growing up, everyone constantly quotes the famous \"Godfather\" but it wasn't until yesterday that I understand why this movie has gained so much admiration, and maintained this strong momentum throughout the years. A chef d'oeuvre is an understatement, it is by far the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen many good movies.The directing is breathtaking, especially the scenes in Sicily, they're so strong \u2013 they take you to another world, a world of traditions and values while haunted with violence and power. I loved how Michael Corleone met his first wife, how he went to ask for permission to see her again. It was such a pure and innocent relationship, and the Sicilian background strengthened the purity in the relationship. It is very interesting to see how purity and power meet.The acting is so spectacular and the chemistry between the characters is very strong. All relationships are so beautifully depicted: the husband / wife (Michael and Kay), father / son / grandson, father / daughter, brother / sister, etc. The character of Connie was particularly interesting in my view, and how it was able to evolve from the oppressed wife in the first movie, to the rebel in the second, and finally the head of the house in the third, and the person who held the family together in a time of tension. The strongest character however and the most captivating in my view is Michael. His extraordinary ability to talk to people, to negotiate while maintaining calm and this poker face of his makes you fall in love.Finally, the music adds a very strong touch to the movie. In takes you back in time, and blends your emotions with those of the actors. It was amazingly played in the very last scene of Godfather III, in the opera house. The scene is very sad, but it gave me tears to the eye not because of sadness for what has happened but for emotion on the artistic beauty of it.You will fall in love with the movie and with every one of the characters. You become addicted to power and greed. Francesco Coppola is really able to submerge you into this wonderful experience. experience.", "Film that blow your mind.": "In the beginning of the film the characters reveal the life they lives.This is not the most interesting part of the film but we need it to see the big picture. After that the amazing story is reveal herself. When yo're a son of a big mafia boss you don't want to be like your father but when he is kill'd by \"the other mafia family\" the story is turn 180 for Michael. Hi respond to them by revenge like it or not this is the beginning of the war for the family's. If you live like this and you are surround by Italians Mafia and very bad gays that want to kill you or other member of your family you will protect them at any cost. Even if you don't want to kill anybody but it is necessary. Many people will say this is not the way to resolve a problems but if you have big money and many guns, why not? The Film has old fashion stile and every time i watch the film i want to be there. For some reasons the film is not like any other films, just like you read a new book and you want to read it all at once to the last page. You don't want to stop for any second and to watch it to the end. Yes the film is long 3 hours but how many films with that duration you don't sleep after the second hour. This is the film that after 3 hours you will wanted to watched't again to be sure that you don't mist anything. Even the film is back at 1972, Coppola just set the work very brilliant for decades ahead.", "clever, cool and full of self-esteem": "The Godfather is a 1972 masterpiece. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, and stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The story of the movie takes place from 1945 to 1955. It the best movie about the Mafia. In addition, many have called it the best movie of all time. A sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and won another Best Picture Oscar, too. It was the only sequel to do so until 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third movie in the Godfather trilogy, The Godfather Part III, came out in 1990. I think it was not as good as the other two movies. Even though if we think the trilogy as one movie, it is the greatest work of the seventh art, I think.", "This movie defined an era": "The Godfather. You just say that name and most people get a picture of Vito or Michael in their head. They can literally see the shady suits and the corrupt deals. This movie defined a generation, people who were kids when it came out wear the badge with honor. I, for one, was not blessed with that gift, but I did grow up with this movie. I convinced my parents to get this movie for me when I was about 12-years old. I sat down and watched it so intently, that for years if someone talked about a scene and didn't say the words just right, I could correct them and tell them down to about the minute where to find that scene in the movie. I would go to Jr. High and talk like I was Vito Corleone, and I'd recruit friends to be in my family. We became a tight bunch because of that fact, so basically, what I'm saying is, The Godfather is responsible for a lot of joy in my life. One of the top 10 greatest movies of all time.", "Master of the Decades": "This is the end of the world. There is no further perfect and quality masterpiece will ever occur. Thanks to the Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola.There are movies that i watch time to time over and over again. Its one of them or i can even say that this is the top of them. Its really a great story that ever became a movie. Its really a masterpiece still, after 4 decades. Its easy to say but think about it, 39 years passed by but none was ever ripped anything from this movie and none will ever do. In spite of its shooting year, its even above 2011.Movies, movies, movies, most of it can not exactly satisfy the audience. You do not like everything that gives you. You do not simply believe the story, believe the characters either. Most of it make you say \"if i were him/her/it i would do exactly the opposite\" but not for the Godfather. Because our Mikey do what we would like to do if we were him. Al Pacino's character Micheal Corleone perfectly satisfy the audience in spite of his youth. Look who has he become this day with his perfect acting. And there was the others like him, James Caan, Frank Duvall, Diane Keaton and of course the Marlon Brando. They all became highly placed stars. Except one star has slided down from the sky. Rest in peace Marlon Brando. He will always be our Don Corleone.", "\"I believe in America....\"": "What is it about someone you care about that sets them apart? Are they family, a friend, or someone you feel just needs help? What causes you to go the extra mile to put someone else ahead of yourself? You may find the answers in your religion, your upbringing, or in movies. For example, say your daughter goes out on a date with a guy and she is violently beaten by him and one of his friends. You go see her in the hospital and she cannot even weep because of the pain. So trying to keep your cool you press charges and try by the legal means to bring the young men to justice. It doesn't happen, their sentences are suspended. That may make you lose faith in the system that is supposed to protect you. So now you go to someone else who could help. This person is a bigshot, a pezzonovante in his own way but outside the system. You explain what happened and what you did, and all he says is 'why didn't you come to me first?' How many times in your life have some of us gone to others that don't care and asked for help instead of going to the ones that actually care. And the problem is solved. Imagine for another example that your father is in the hospital and men are coming to kill him. And you are the only one there that can help him. Imagine that you had your own dreams and your own goals that were different to what your father wanted. But in this moment you put all that aside to help your father survive. You assure him that everything will be ok and you are with him now. You bluff out the men trying to kill him and your father is saved. Most of us may never have to defend our dads from someone trying to kill him. But seeing someone laying helpless in a hospital bed in need of help we can all relate to. Every son, every daughter, every parent, every sibling, every friend. You see everybody wants to talk about the gangster mafia element of The Godfather, and say that is what it is all about. But family plays an even bigger role in the story by being the driving force behind the main characters. Family, love, loyalty, sacrifice all these elements are used in the movie to bring a standard boring mafia shootout movie to the level of greatest movie of all time. Francis Ford Coppola used as much he could to bring this point home. The wedding scene was not made up by any means but instead taken from other weddings witnessed by every Italian who has ever been to a wedding. Bringing envelopes filled with money to the bride, nieces dancing on the feet of uncle's, people waiting in line to see the father of the bride, sandwiches in white paper being tossed around. 'two gabagool, one proshootoh!' Then go to the kitchen to make spaghetti. Need a recipe? Try 'a little of oil then fry some garlic, throw in some tomatoes and tomato paste, fry it, make sure it does not stick, get it to boil, put in all your sausage and meatballs, add some wine and a little bit of sugar and that's the trick.' That recipe has been in Italian kitchens long before the cameras rolled. Need an idea for some quality time with the kids, well go to work do what you have to do and pick up some cannolis before you get home. Just remember to leave the gun and take the cannolis. Coppola always said he had to be good or no cannolis when his dad got home to share with the family. Coppola also put in his own family to work, his dad scored the movie, his sister Talia was Connie, and his daughter played the baby in the baptism scene. The family was on both sides of the family. But for me the movie revolves around Don Vito Corleone and Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo based the character of Don Corleone on his mother, everytime the Don opened his mouth all that came out was the passion of his mother, her wisdom, her ruthlessness, and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself. Therefore only the greatest actor of the day will do to play the part. Coppola agreed and suggested either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier was considered and it would have been interesting but he eventually passed on the role. Only two men wanted Brando, Coppola and Puzo. Brando had a history of being difficult and the studio executives nearly vetoed his casting. Coppola was able to make a deal with in order to cast Brando. Brando had to agree to do the movie for nothing, he had to put up a bond in order to cover cost overruns, and he had to do a screen test. They only got to the screen test because Brando transformed himself from a forty year old man into a sixty year old mafia don before their eyes in a matter of minutes. When the executives saw the footage they said 'no no no, WOW THAT'S INCREDIBLE!' Brando would be The Godfather. But Brando still needed a little extra help. If you watch the movie, everytime Don Corleone is speaking and stops and looks off in the distance he is reading from a card with his lines on it. He still won an oscar though. Two scenes are my favorite in the movie. One is the scene in the restaurant, I feel like I don't need to explain it, because it is the most famous scene. Just know that without that scene the movie would not have existed. When you shoot a movie, the scenes are viewed day by day by the studio decision makers. They were hating what they were seeing, everything shot before the restaurant scene was met with cruel criticism by everyone on the outside not working on the movie. All Coppola could do was show them this scene and the movie was not only saved but validated. There are moments in the movie that other scenes build to, the restaurant was one of those scenes. You know of it's importance because of everything that preceded it. The other scene is the meeting. Don Corleone stands before the other mafia dons and surrenders to them and their wishes. He reasons with them in order to come to a peaceful solution. But there is a catch: if you mess with my other son or if 'he's struck by a bolt of lightning. Then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room and that I do not forgive. So with that aside let me say that I swear, on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one that breaks the peace that we've made here today.' There is a time for peace and a time for reckoning. This scene is my favorite because you believe him, you go along with his plea for peace. But the other dons do not realize it is not a surrender but a tactical retreat.\nSo the movie went on to make a lot of money, win a bunch of awards, and won it's way on a bunch of lists that say it's great. I was lucky enough to not know that when I first saw the movie. I saw it for what it was: a father and three sons. One son was intense and savage, another was sweet and innocent, another was conviving and calculating, the father was all those combined. But the father was the steadying force in all their lives. That is why when they all find out he was shot they react in ways we all would react. When you see the father lying in the street his second son is there to help but can't, all he can do is cry and yell 'papa.' The first son nearly strong arms one of his father's closest associates because he wants someone to beat up. The third son panics and tries to do whatever he can to help. That is for the audience, and that that's how everyone relates. Finally, I'll quote Martin Sheen: 'The Godfather is the best filmmaking ever in the history of American cinema. There is nothing that speaks more to who we are, where we came from, what we stand for, and where we're gonna go. That's the work of a true genius.' I agree. It is my favorite, of what I've seen of course.\".... Don Corleone.\"", "The greatest American film ever, period.": "For many years \"Lawrence of Arabia\" was my favorite movie. And, as a serious student of cinema I very much admire \"Citizen Kane.\" But, at some point during the 1970's \"The Godfather\" overtook all others, and I doubt seriously whether we will see the likes of this magnificent film again in my lifetime.In \"The Godfather\" all the elements of picture-making come together in splendid perfection. The script, actors, cinematography, production values, music, effects, and direction are all superb and seamless. Sex, violence, loyalty, betrayal, revenge, love, hate, and even comedy--all find a home here. It is a remarkable achievement, equaled only by \"The Godfather--Part II.\"", "Simply put, this is the greatest film ever made.": "As close to a perfect film as you're going to get.  The young, fairly new director(in 1972)Francis Ford Coppola did an outstanding job of getting A+ performances out of his 'entire' cast. When watching this masterpiece of American film, one does not even take notice that they are watching actors perform.  Instead, it's as if a hidden camera has captured the real lives of a post war New York mafia family.  This is by far my favorite film of all time and recomend it as a must see.  I envy the person who will have the thrill of seeing it for the first time.  It's quite awsome.", "Beautiful film": "Very good cript. Beautiful film just perfect:)......", "Best Movie Ever Made": "The Godfather is the best movie ever made. I recommend it to everybody who hasn't seen it, you don't know what your are missing. Its perfection that's why gave it a 10 in rating. Every time I see the movie again it amazes me how good it is.", "A review I could not refuse...": "What can I say about this magnificent and vital piece to both cinema and cinematic history? I remember watching the film on a whim during this recent summer; and I was starstruck while watching it as I experienced both the films beauty and preternatural intensity. Francis Ford Coppola knew how to adapt Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" with infinite, unquestionable and miraculous perfection! Anyone who has watched the film isn't just watching it-they're living it! We feel the bursts of the Don Corleone's (Marlon Brando) fiery, we tear at his beautifully philosophically spoken dialogue, and we feel the immense power and influence his character possesses...Al Pacino as Michael Corleone also holds us in with infinite gravity that we cannot resist nor rebel against. He moves, we watch. He speaks, we listen--all while being mesmerized at his unfortunate, yet incredible transition from the beginning and end of the filmI highly commend Coppola's direction; the man knew his job extremely well, and so whatever one sees within this film isn't a millisecond wasted. Words cannot describe how much praise and respect that I have for this film and its sequel, The Godfather: Part II.", "Movie of the Life Time": "This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers.", "The Greatest. Truly.": "Now, let's take a look at what anyone who is serious about film says is the greatest of all time. They're right. Both Godfathers stand alone as the two of the best scripted, acted, and directed films of all time. In all, they come out to the two best films. If you read some of my other reviews, you'll find that I consider a saga one film. A saga is best watched simultaneously. The Godfathers are a perfect example of how a series can get it right. Except the third. The third was just plain bad. Did Coppola really need to do this? Throw in another addition to the greatest saga in history? Sure, Andy Garcia was pretty spot-on as Sonny's illegitimate child. But they might as well have had someone like Dustin Hoffman play Michael, because he would've looked and sounded more like him than Pacino did at the time. And Sofia sucked. Good director, bad actress. It was not needed, because the first two were flawless. The ways of how this crime family rose, fell, rose, fell, etc., was perfect. I distinctly remember saying in one of my film classes (in front of a bunch of total film snobs) that Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The other students stared at me with blank looks on their faces, as if I had told some horribly offensive jokes. Screw them. Why shouldn't he be considered? He deserves it, with The Godfather, Part II, Apocalypse Now, and The Conversation. Four classics. Did the other students not like it because he made a couple of flops (Jack, The Rainmaker)? All the best did (Kubrick-Eyes Wide Shut, Nolan-Insomnia), and they continue to be praised. I did enjoy The Outsiders, even if it doesn't come close to touching The Godfathers. Apart, they are masterpieces. Together, they are the definition of flawless filmmaking. The genius behind the storyline is that we never see the Don at his peak. We see him just before his peak, and just after as well. Everything, from the script to the directing, makes this storyline perfect. But it is the acting that has the biggest aspect on the story. Two actors (De Niro and Branda, both two-time winners) won for the role of Don Vito. Also, the surrounding cast of Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Keaton, make the film what it is, attached to a pitch-perfect script by Mario Puzo and Coppola. to quote Richard Roeper, saying you like film but have never seen The Godfather is like \"saying you love to drink but you've never had water.\" Too true.", "Top 1": "Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael , Santino and Tom Hagen , his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates. he Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.", "The Godfather: A Timeless Masterpiece of Cinema": "The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time. The film's plot follows the Corleone crime family, with particular focus on the patriarch of the family, Vito Corleone, and his son Michael as they navigate their way through the world of organized crime in New York City.One of the most striking aspects of the film is its ability to blend themes of family, loyalty, power, and corruption in a way that feels both authentic and emotionally resonant. The performances from the cast, particularly Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, are nothing short of phenomenal and have become iconic in the annals of film history.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful and the film's score, composed by Nino Rota, perfectly complements the film's mood and atmosphere. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is also noteworthy, capturing the gritty and realistic feel of New York City and the Corleone family's world.The film's pacing is also well-done, with each scene building on the previous one to create a sense of tension and uncertainty. The editing is seamless and the dialogue is sharp and memorable.In short, The Godfather is a film that should not be missed. It is a true classic that has left a lasting impact on cinema and popular culture. The film's themes and performances continue to resonate with audiences today and it's no wonder it is considered one of the greatest films ever made.", "Probably one of the Worst movies I've seen": "This entire series being a classic, I had to watch it. I regret all of it. It was 12-13 hours of my life that I won't get back.This movie is horrible. The plot moves slowly, drearily, and almost nothing happens. Audio is shabby, and understanding what is going on, and most crucially: WHY? is incredibly difficult. Keeping track of who is what guy is also difficult, as the names are rarely said; the lighting is poor, making this even worse. I didn't know who was who until the third movie, which I had to force myself to watch.As a classic, watch it. Doesn't mean you have to like it, but now you can say why you hated it, which is the best part for me.", "Greatest of ALL": "As far as I'm concerned, there is no other movie that could compete with The Godfather. Having seen it for more than a couple of times, I still find it great. I have read the book for a couple of times and I will read it again after the exams, when I have more time, because it's even better than the movie. I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the movie.", "timeless masterpiece": "This movie may have comes out 25 years before i was born, but recently my mom came home with the 40th anniversary edition. I just finished watching the first and second film, they are amazing i just can't stop talking about them. I love the power games there is between everyone. Im not much for gangster or action films, but this really got to me. It was amazing to watch it on blue ray the light was perfect. I enjoyed every little part of this film, and didn't seem to noticed it lasted almost 3 hours. I don't ever write reviews but this was a film i think everyone should watch, its a timeless masterpiece which I'm sure would could be enjoyed by many in my generation. And the acting is superb, but Al never seems to disappoint me.", "WHAT A FILM": "The Godfather is simply a truly great film, that has some of the best acting ever committed to film. Pacino is superb, Brando inspiring and Caan one of cinemas great angry men. It is a film of operatic brilliance and I is the best gangster film ever made.", "Excellent in every aspect": "I truly loved The Godfather and I'm 14. The movie is absolutely hard to dislike, ex. great acting, great dialogue, great way of ending the film. I can't believe this film got only 3 Academy Awards. It deserved a lot better than that. James Caan should have won Best Supporting Actor. He was excellent as he was aggressive.  Yes, this is the greatest film of all time, better than Citizen Kane, which was a very good movie as well.  What I most loved about The Godfather is that it is completely original and unforgettable. If  you don't like it, \"I'll give you an offer you can't refuse.\" Ha, ha.", "Just wow": "This movie is the definition of masterpiece.All the movies is something special but this on is the one that 9 from 10 viewers pick as their favourite.", "The pinnacle of American film. Undoubtedly a masterpiece.": "You may be wondering what all the fuss is about. Allow me to explain. What we have here in The Godfather is a film that is flawless in mostly every area. A film so deeply ingrained in our pop-culture that we aware of it without a direct mention. It takes a rich, deep, and intimate narrative; mixes it with stunning performances from a brilliant cast; adds the startling and intense direction of Francis Ford Coppola, and finishes it all off with an array of imagery and dialogue that is imbued in every film lovers' mind. It is immaculately paced, rewarding, and allows you to take something new from it every time you see it. This is everything a film should be. Go watch it.", "Francis Ford Coppola has made us an offer we can not refuse": "Well where can I start it was just fantastic from start to finish. The mix of innocent Michael getting mixed up, to becoming the most street-wise mob boss of all time. I was just gripped by this. All the actors in this movie are top notch and especially with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in it. Also the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton who have made a real name for themselves a real name from this movie. I could not get enough of Michael Corleone, that icy character that hardly lost his temper, and never would let you know what he was thinking, really gripped into watching this movie over and over again.my hat comes off to Francis and his team they have made a true masterpiece that is THE GODFATHER.", "The movie that made me love Al Pacino": "The Godfather was the first movie I ever saw that Al Pacino was in. I was glued to the TV the first time I saw it (of course I was, who wouldn't be?). Now Al Pacino is my favorite actor. The Godfather is one of my favorite movies of all time!! Not only that, it is one of the greatest movies of all time!!!!!", "It really deserves to be praised!": "I'm too considering as this movie has to be praised. I watched it when I was only 8. And now I am 31, and really I enjoyed even I watched it many times. Thanks for the director Mr. Coppola, producers, actors & actresses who played in and executed it. This movie was the best I've ever watched in my all life. Thank you boyz & girlz.", "the medium by which movies are measured": "coppolla's masterpiece stands alone in film history. From the festive begginning to the inevitable end, this movie truly moves one. In the tradition of the greek tragedy, the superb story is crafted on a man trying to evade his fate. Al pacino and Marlon Brando give the performances of their lives, and james Caan executes perfectly as the hotheaded sonny. Props to Coppolla's vision and ingenuity, truly one of the great films of all time.", "Matchless Movie !": "I watched The Godfather back in 2012 .. but then I read the novel in 2017 and watched it again ...It is haunting and captivating tale of a mafia organization 9.5/10", "The Two of Us": "I recently watched the 1968 French film \"The Two of Us\" directed by Claude Berri, which tells of the development of a relationship between an anti-Semetic old man in the country who becomes the guardian of a young Jewish boy during World War II. (Actually, the title of the French movie translates better to \"The Old Man and the Boy\".) To me, it appears that the scenes in \"The Godfather\" where Vito is an old man in a garden playing with a young boy with a spray can were very much informed by this French film. The film would certainly have been available to Coppola and Brando during the filming of \"The Godfather\". Although it may be stretching things a bit, the actor who portrays the old man in the French film has a very distinct chin, and it may be that Brando came up with the idea of putting tissues in his jowls from observing that actor. I wonder if others have spotted these similarities.", "Possibly the G.O.A.T.": "All due respect to James Gandolfini and the Sopranos, but they ain't got nothing on the Godfather.This movie without a doubt is the best mob movie ever made. It is well respected from all movie directors and inspired many actors/ filmmakers. The directing is wonderful, not to mention the acting is brilliant, cinematography perfect, and everything else about it. I personally believe that any writer/actor starting out in their careers should take the time to view the godfather and experience what a real movie is. The film itself is told in the most perfect way it could be showed. HANDS DOWN. The godfather is not in MY top 10 list of all time favorite movies, but I easily predict it to be in the top 5 best movies of all time in any poll put in front of me. 1. Citizen Cane, 2. Casablanca 3. the godfather 4. on the waterfront 5. Schindlers list", "Pure brilliance, cinema at it's best.": "Have you ever wanted to watch a movie with decency and class, with elegance and stature. If so, then this is it. The Godfather provides the audience with stunning acting, dialogue and memorable scenes. The acting is phenomenal, with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and John Cazale all putting forward Oscar worthy performances.The story is brilliant, director Francis Ford Coppola really put a lot of thought into this and the way the story is shown, it never loses interest, even though the film is two and a half hours long. If you stay focused, you stay amazed. If the acting and plot weren't good enough, be prepared to be blown away by the classic theme for this movie, the way it is put into the scenes really adds to he grand stature of the movie.It's a 10/10 and a definite watch for movie lovers with a good taste.", "One of the few perfect films you will ever see.": "A perfect film, masterfully crafted by director Francis Ford Coppola, based on author Mario Puzo's timeless classic. The epic story of Family and Power is Aristotelean Tragedy at its finest.In addition, no where else in American cinema will you find a finer ensemble of actors, amazingly each giving one of the finest performances of their respective Hall of Fame careers.Brando's \"Don Vito Corleone\" is easily the most imitated character in the history of cinema, and the film boasts more memorable lines and scenes than any I can remember.The fact that it was followed by an equally perfect sequel, makes the Godfather legacy even more impressive and powerful.Praise to the Godfather, the King of all movies.", "This is a review for my Media Literacy Class": "The Godfather is a 1972 gangster film by Francis Ford Coppola that portrays the life of a family outsider who becomes a merciless head of one of New York's most dominant Mafia families: the Corleone's. Along with the Corleone's come four other rival and ally families striving to become the underground kings of New York in the late 1940's early 1950's. They fight for their power, respect, and pride as they interact with each other. The five families are the Corleone's, the Tallaglia's, the Barzini's, the Cueneo's, and the Stracci's. The families all have their sole leaders who are addressed as Dons. The Dons are Vito Corleone, Philip Tattaglia, Emilio Barzini, Ottilio Cueno, and Anthony Stracci. Throughout the film the Dons of each family gather together to discuss and try to resolve any differences they may have. In one scene, Jack Woltz, a studio head who did not comply, wakes up to find the head of his prized horse in bed with him. The horse head symbolizes the power they have and how easily they can kill. Another scene involves a dead fish wrapped in a vest to symbolize that the dead character \"sleeps with the fishes\". The fact that they use animals is symbolic. The families may have on-going conflicts but at the meetings there seems to be an established peace treaty. Despite there being four other Dons they all seem to look at Don Corleone as the most powerful. The Corleone family is a well-established one. They are very family oriented for the most part. The family consists of Vito, Sonny, Fredo, Michael, Carmela, Connie, Apollnia, Kay, and Sandra. The Corleone has very close allies including Pete Clemenza, Luca Brasi, and Tom Hagen; Vito's legal adviser. Don Vito Corleone is the main character in this film. He works hard to maintain the status of his family as an organized one. Although he is a crime boss he tries to have legitimate reasons for his actions. Don Vito is a high ranked man in Little Italy, New York. He has many connections and is always finding ways to build upon his empire and also giving back to the community. Don Corleone offers protection to many of the business owners in exchange for their loyalty and services. Since he is so powerful the other four Dons look to him as a growing threat. In the streets of Little Italy, there is an on-going crime war for territory, property, drugs, and all out power. The Corleone house is the family's protected safe haven where most of the movie's important sequences and dialogues are shown. The film takes a turn when Don Vito is severely injured and hospitalized. Control of the Corleone family is up for grabs so Sonny steps in as Don. Sonny is later set-up and killed. His death causes a stir between Don Vito and the other families. Sonny's character is the \"shoot first, ask later\" type of guy so when labeled Don, he immediately took action. Sonny and most of the other Dons, like most men, can't help but try to take on the role as an alpha male. Michael's character starts off as shy but eventually grows to learn the family business. Don Vito does not intend for his son Michael to join in the family business. Don Vito has surrounded himself is crime and wants a better life for his son. When Michael realizes his brother Fredo is too weak to be in charge, he takes control. Michael is a very intelligent man who understands he must pick up right where his father left off because in Mafia's, one mistake can lead to your family's demise. Though the film is about different Mafia families, the violence throughout the movie plays a very small role in the bigger picture. The \"rise to power\" clich\u00e9 is about having the most allies and maintaining power through fear, not the actual action of killing. Michael's rise to power comes at a higher cost. It takes the deaths of his older brother, family enforcer, and wife for him to realize that he was meant for that lifestyle. If none of those deaths had occurred then Michael and his wife Kay would not be dragged into their new roles as a Don and his wife. Michael's first hit was sloppy but then Copalla makes it so that as Don, Michael's hits go smoothly. This makes it seem like the title Don matures Michael in a sense. The death of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and the birth of his son, Anthony Corleone, symbolizes new beginnings for the Corleone family. At the end of the film, Michael is questioned by his wife about the death of his brother-in-law. Michael denies any involvement and his wife accepts his answer, he is then addressed as Don Corleone by his capos.

The acting by all the actors(Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale & all the others)was just amazing. The level of detail the director went down to all the scenes was very very impressive and something that I'm yet to see in other movies. Both of the cinematography and the music score are perfect. We know nothing is perfect but this simply is just perfect. For example: The way the scene in the hospital was carried out was simply amazing. All the silence used in that scene really made things very tense for the viewers. From all the movies I've ever watched that scene has made me the most tense.Watched this movie exactly 40 years after it's release, but loved watching every minute of it. Not every such movie keeps a watcher interested for the whole period of the show but this is different.", "The Classical Legendary Masterpiece...": "Magnificent portrait of organized crimeThis is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definitely a \"must see\" masterpiece.", "The Godfather is an OK flick.": "I see that this show is #2 on the list of successful movies at IMDb so it would be impossible for me to more flatter it. I saw this movie when I was in Junior High School. My parents were all about Law School at the University and my feeling was this was a hero movie about an outlaw. There is a frightening scene in this movie about a horse's head being found in the bed of the Godfather's enemy's bed. Crossing the Godfather is forbidden, per Se, and he defends his Italian Mafia friends with a machine gun. And, I think it looked like a foreign film because it takes place in a rich castle on luxurious estate. The Godfather character in this film was a likable, \"regular person's\" advocate. I had Italian people in my family (as well as Gangsters in my school). By the way, as a result of my literary studies, I have found God is synonymous with dog so Godfather is a derogatory slang term.", "The Best Trilogy Ever! May contain spoilers": "The year is 1945. The Sicilian-American family, the Corleones, is celebrating the wedding of a daughter, Connie, in New York. Everything is going fine...except for the secret meeting held inside the house, a secret meeting on revenge. Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is discussing a problem with a close associate, while his mentor, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) stands on. The Don's three sons are outside celebrating the wedding: Sonny, the hot-tempered oldest brother; Fredo, the shy and quiet middle son; and Michael, the youngest son who has returned from fighting in World War II. Sonny and Fredo are in with the Don's council of 'whacking' people, but Michael refuses to be any part of it, due to total commitment to his girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). However, one day while shopping for food with Fredo, Don Corleone is shot by a betrayal, and is rushed to the hospital. The verdict: An assassination attempt. After hearing this, from Long Beach, California, Michael rushes back home to his father. After hearing about the ones who almost killed the Don, he plots revenge with Sonny and close associates. But a twist of fate happens to the family, and in the end, the once-reluctant Michael is made Don over the Corleones.Francis Ford Coppola beautifully shows a portrait of what seemed to be a harmless family into such malice. The story was adapted from the number one hit by Mario Puzo, who also collaborated with Coppola in this project. The cinematography is excellent, the screenplay gripping and intelligent, and the haunting but enchanting score is memorable. Marlon Brando is absolutely divine as the ruthless, merciful Don Corleone, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor. New-comer Al Pacino is extremely excellent as Michael, showing both the innocence and fierceness of the son, and his performance received many praises. James Caan is great as scary Sonny, and Robert Duvall could not be a better Tom.Some notable scenes are the monologue, the Baptism, and the ever-famous horse-head-in-the-bed scene. This demonstrates how scary and malicious the Mob can be. With twists and turns, it shows that even the Mob can lead everyday lives, but one could have a particularly hard time dealing with carrying out a deadly job twenty-four seven.I personally love this movie, because of the intrigue I felt as I read some of the novel. I definitely recommend this film to people, but I hope that you would not show this to young children. Some things could scar them for life, much like myself...If you like this movie, I also recommend you watch the other two films with the trilogy. In my opinion, this is the greatest trilogy ever made.", "11/10": "One of the best movie ever made. It will put you in the set and be a part of the Corleone's family. Live inside the movie with the cast and share their memories and their feelings of love, hate and revenge. The acting of Don Corleone and his magnificent voice while stroking a cat at the beginning its a mental picture that will reappear in your head every time someone mentioned the name - Corleone. Inspired from actual events that happened from the 20s all the way to the 60s wrapped around in 3 lengthy but brilliant movies. The movie starts with an introduction to the family which portraits Corleone's family as a very close, respected family that want to try and stay away from trouble.", "The Masterpiece of Organized Crime, Everything Started Here.": "Simply you just have to see it. If there wasn't before this movie a \"mafia\" with a code of honor brought over from Sicilia to the US, this movie created it. Nowadays it's an integral part of North American folk history. It depicts organized crime as a family, a respectable business, carried out under strict regulations, enforced out by the \"pater familia\" out of the respect, appreciation and authority gained among his extended family, \"the village\", while employing the respect others professed for him to preserve his authority, and yet, although perceived as last recourse, if necessary to keep his \"Family\", honor or authority safe, employing without hesitation blunt and unforgiving brute force was neither taboo nor regretted. Changes in the \"Old Ways\" are about manifest as a new younger generation (US born, and no Italian immigrants) began to take over the family business and the drugs dealing business appeared in the picture \u2014 before they were forbidden as the code didn't allow for indiscriminate damage to the \"Extended Family\" (their own people).But now it was more a question of supremacy against other ethnicities (immigrants and their descendants), who were willing to sell drugs to anyone who wanted to buy, even their own people or the \"Italo-Americans\". As they saw it, If they let them get all the pieces of this pie, the drug business which was so lucrative, they'll quickly become the most powerful and would pose a real threat to the mere existence of \"The Family\". The youngsters didn't find a solution viable other than to break the code and start dealing with drugs (even to their own \"Extended Families\", as they reasoning was that they were going to get it anyways, it'll always be better that the business remained in \"The Family\".From there on, although at first sight it may had seem everything continued like before, it really wasn't like that at all, something had broken at the very root of \"The Family\", it had changed forever and they were in a path of no return. Respect was slowly and continuously replaced by fear... And that was a one way ticket to a new era, the one of a Wounded to Death, Crumbling Empire. After watching The Trilogy and the movies Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and Scarface. If you can (have the spare time), do not miss The Sopranos (the HBO TV Series) by the also great James Gandolfini.

It is not for everyone though.I know some people that do not like it. The reason is because it's not their kind of movie.

It is the greatest film ever, just like Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and Shindlers List, it has mastered its genre, except many people do not know of the film!!! Now days movies such as oceans 11, Layer cake and even police investigative stories try to have the original concept of them film, with the moral battling of crime. The beauty of the story is that it is original and none of the actors (in the first part) were well known, which gives them an better on-screen identity, compared to modern day Hollywood heroes such as brad Pitt, Collin pharrel and Tom Cruise. Even action packed scarface can take The Godfathers title as 'Best Crime/Gangster Film Ever' because that is exactly what godfather is. Its only downfall is the conclusion of the saga, in part number three which is kind off like The Matrix trilogy in a way, The First part had a cult following, number 2 was \"good but will never beat the first\" and the third one was awful! The Godfather = legendary film, which will live long in existence especially with the Italian population! The only deteriorating factor is its lenght not many people can watch a film for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but i could :). Also the plot is tricky to understand for first time viewers!", "Nice Movie": "He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies.

So boring I decided not to watch the last hour.I will admit that the scene where the police captain and the drug guy was shot was quite good.

Al Pacino starts out as a 'nice college boy' who refuses to become embroiled in the family business, only to become ensnared when an attempt is made on his father's life.

Every aspect of the film is utterly brilliant. From the characters and their individual development down to the lighting. It is difficult to put into words how this film makes you feel. It certainly is not just another gangster film that categorises or stereotypes Italian-Americans. Instead it is a tale of man, who despite everything his father wanted for him, is hurled into a life that he is totally wrong for at the start of the movie. But given the events that take place over the course of his life he loses everything that is good inside of him, and he becomes cold and calculated and perfect for the life his father shielded him from. You become immersed in 1940's America, and through the trilogy far beyond that. It is the only film where I refuse to watch the first one, without subsequently watching the other three in the days that follow. It is an epic that words cannot do justice.If I recommend just one film to anyone for the rest of my life it will be this one. I judge my friends who have not seen this film, and pressure them into watching it. I mistrust anyone who says they don't like this film.Marlon Brando is sublime, Al Pacino is excellent, James Caan is fantastic and Robert Duvall is incredible.

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi", "Al Pacino rising": "This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.

Its 3 hours long, which is far too long, it's beyond boring and the story, or what little story there is makes no sense. I did not understand why anything happened throughout the whole movie, each death just happened for seemingly no reason out of the blue. Some of the actors mumble so much they are impossible to understand or speak in Italian without subtitles, which doesn't help in following along with what's happening.

I believe this film has arguably the 2 greatest performances in cinematic history -- 1 being Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and 2 being Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone.

It changed somewhat during the years, but my empire is still run in a similar way.Great movie without too much overacting. Some of the shots even look too much like it was shot in an amateuristic live situation.

But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography.

Let he just sat there, between the dark corner of the room, as if place oneself in the center of the universe black hole. People respect him, love him, and fear him, and he is so complex, and so deep. The great thing about the godfather is, he knows himself as emperor \"underground\" of responsibilities: the greater the power, the greater the responsibility. So he always adhere to their own beliefs, no drug harm. For which he refused the drug lords, loss demands, even to a fatal disaster. It is so, \"the godfather\" tells us that as long as you can face the world with dignity, you can live with dignity. So he can casually with top political figures adept, from the bottom of society to the top, he can weave a net intangible and multifarious.

From the opening to the climax inter-cut with the baptism of Connie Corleone's son you will be riveted to your television screen. This is not, however, a fast-moving mob film like Martin Scorsese's work, but more of a drama. Also unlike Scorsese's work, this is more of a romanticised version of mob life, and you will grow to like the characters better because of this If Mafia films aren't your cup of tea I still recommend The Godfather as it depicts family life as well as Family life, showing how Don Vito keeps his family together through good and bad.

The photography is good for the time it was filmed. The actors killed it. I like the music although it was very repetitive.

Al Pacino was adorable. James Caan was great. Robert Duval was really great. It is really hard to tell what is missing in this movie. The whole package was really astonishing. I have never imagined a movie will have such an impact on me as well as on many others. I have watched it with my brothers a couple of years ago. You won't believe it if I tell you that every year I go to a movie store and rent it again. I will be doing this for the rest of my life because it is an artistic piece that is worth watching more and more. In conclusion, I would like to say that if Marlon Brando had not been there, this movie would have lost a lot of its glimmering and shimmering light. Al Pacino was also as outstanding as Marlon Brando. The movie is a way beyond criticism. It is a work of art for all generations and at all times.

It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing.

At one point, i was made to believe that I too was a part of the movie and a living-breathing character. I was so into it. Oh my god it was perfection. Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's acting was nothing less than AWE-INSPIRING. The scene when Al Pacino shoots down 'Solozzo and McCluskey' was terrific. It just transformed Michael's character from a civilized American army-man into a civilized Sicilian-American don, and this journey of transformation was conducted so beautifully in the movie. Another great scene was when Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) expresses his grief to Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) his son over Michael's current profession. He tells Michael as to how he once hoped that Michael would be the one to give the family a taste of Legality, but ended up being the Don who would head the Crime Family of the Corleone's.

In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk.

How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.", "A very influencing film": "This film has been a major favorite.. Loved every single part of the film", "Greatest ever American drama movie": "From the very first seconds, this film displays a sense of majesty. The performances are spot on - especially Al Pacino & Marlon Brando. The wonderful prolonged wedding scene that opens the film sets a standard for all other film makers. The Godfather theme song is tremendous - the most haunting ever. The interplay between all actors is of the highest standard and the \"look\" of the film is convincing & classy. This film marks the highpoint of American cinema and although films like Good Fellas and Field of Dreams have come close, the general standard of US films since The Godfather has been in gradual decline. Truly a masterpiece.", "I LOVE THE GODFATHER!": "This movie in particular got me interested in cinema and being in front of the camera. Though I have 34% Italian blood in me, though it doesn't look like it, I always aspired to portray an Italian character. I can say- hands down- this movie inspired me to act be one the screen!", "This is good movie": "Pretty much good movie, one of gratest films i see", "Brando, Pacino and Deniro at their best.": "The Godfather is a not just a film but its a movement, it defines the past of the Italian American culture. A past that many American Italians are ashamed of but a past that I think the American people should know about. Any Italian could tell you that the principles of family that are portrayed in this film reflect the traditions of the old country. Family comes first before anything, this is a value that is passed down from generation to generation in the Italian culture, it was good to see that Coppola portrayed this in such a strong manner. It takes filming to a whole new level and changed the way we see films. Brando, Deniro and Pacino are genius! The acting compliments the impeccable work of Francis Ford Coppola. In my books this is a must see film, the book is not so bad either. The work of Coppola makes a long film seem like minutes.", "The excellent and dynamic movie ever made": "A number of factors are just designed to end up being ideal, sleek as well as nicely, godly. This Godfather, through Francis Kia Coppola as well as Mario Puzo is actually. Just how all facets involving filmmaking as well as storytelling enhances the other within this unforgettable motion picture leads to that you ask yourself ( really) if such a task might be repeated, actually.I possess the maximum value for your software prior to everything related to videos, therefore Let me look at Godfather's script initial.Used from Mario Puzo's book in the very same identify This Godfather is dependant on the man's relationship along with his family members as well as his / her responsibilties to that, that could result in your pet in order to forego her own dreams as well as aspirations. That this build is actually put on show through one of the most highly effective mafia individuals with 1940s Nyc causes it to be all the more fascinating.The easy piece getting that the head in the Corleone criminal offenses family members is actually ageing as well as other criminal offenses companies would like your pet out of the way looks quite simple. Key in Wear Vito Corleone's littlest kid Erina also called 'the not liable university boy' - seeing that his / her parent buddy as well as apparent heir Sonny Corleone loves to telephone your pet - in addition to a young lady. They sums upward his / her living as well as that he / she desires from using it with foreseeable future available as one line - \"This is actually our kids Kay, not necessarily everyone. inch Rather plainly the kid wishes practically nothing about his / her criminal offenses family members or even it is electric power.

I think we all have put gum or paper in our jaws and pretended to be the God Father. Needless to say the cast was great in this film. This film will never get old. Kids in 2020 will still watch this film. Now this is film that can have sequels with no problem.", "The Greatest!": "Perhaps the greatest movie ever made. Growing up i watched this movie more than a hundred times, and still.. never ceases to amaze me.The honor and morality of ruthless kilers, the cold and in the same time warm atmosphere. The clash between the top actors (Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall) and the newcomers (Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, John Casale, James Caan). This movie is a school in acting and directing, and a pure sample of how a flawless movie should be.Everything perfect.", "the best movie ever": "This is my number one movie.

Reviewers from some newspapers and magazines gave it strong advanced notices, and that got the ball rolling before other media and the public saw it. Plus it had almost an all-star cast headed by Brando, often considered the king of American actors of his generation. Granted Pacino and some of the others were young but most of the cast had some reputation going in.I know Coppola had not directed much if any but was known as a good writer, especially from \"Patton.\" My gripe with the movie is it is basically an overblown melodrama with a lot of hype and gloss. The cinematography is good but not great. The acting: while a few minor people are good, Brando is terrible, mumbling more than ever with those cotton balls or whatever in his cheeks. Why did he think he had to play it this way? James Caan gives the best performance. And the flick is hackneyed, an old-time gangster one, full of violence and anger and crudeness. It is not film noir. They took the crime genre and Hollywooded it up, trying to make something grandiose. Two gangs pitted against each other, using gages and fifty caliber submachine guns. So what else is new? \"Little Caesar\" was better.", "like like": "How many times have I seen this movie? I enjoyed so much. This film is very popular in Iran. Although a lot of films have been made in these years, this film is one of the best films of the 1980s", "Badass!": "Such a good movie, i can always watch this movie when it comes on TV, one of my personal favorites.", "Old school": "One of the best movies you'll ever watch. Amazing acting and great story line", "The Pinnacke Of Flawless Films!": "This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems \"too old or young for the part\". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem \"out of place\" or \"unconvincing\". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS \"The Godfather Saga\" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.", "Best of the Trilogy": "I know it is such a clich\u00e9 to say it after thousands of comments, but this is a must-watch movie. You probably have seen all the impostors around acting like Marlon Brando which is funny of course but still it strikes you because of how much effort he put to pull off this movie. Although it might get boring sometimes, the acting and the sense of reality wind you up with the plot making it an easy-to- watch movie. Just to give you some heads-up, the first movie of the sequel can elevate the expectations for the rest, you won't regret for the time you spared for this movie. The plot is designated so well that it encircles you in every way not letting you stop or look away from the screen. In my opinion this is the best mafia-related movie in which all the racketeers and kingpins do not cut a swath and you admire even to the ones who die during the movie. Long story short, this movie definitely deserves its place among the top three in all time favorite movies.", "It is just an incredible movie then, now, and for eternity.": "For a film that is almost 50 years old now, the story is brilliant, the acting, sensational especially from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. I watched this movie for the first time about 2 weeks ago now and wish I had seen it sooner. There are very few films that I would give a 10/10 to but the godfather takes the cake with the cherry on top, for those who like a good story, brilliant acting, a bit of the mafia, guns blazing, this is your cuppa, it certainly is mine. Utterly incredible, now I just need to watch part 2 and 3!", "A CULT": "Nothing need to say.. Acult movie. Best permformances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino", "A Movie": "At least it is touted that way. But can we appeal to someone who says it's a poem?", "Brief comment on a masterpiece not without flaws": "I will keep my review to a minimum as so much has been written on this film. It is a fantastic film (up there with Once Upon a Time in the West as one of the greatest of all). I watched it again for the 8th time after not seeing it for 5 years or so, and had forgotten just how immersive the film is. My only negative comment, and I add this as I haven't heard this criticism before, is that this is one of the few films that would benefit from being a little longer. At times the film cuts between scenes too quickly and speeds through threads looking almost cartoony, which is at odds with the general mood of the film of a slow relaxed immersive experience. In particular consider when Tom visits Hollywood to get Johnny Fontane a role. The sequence seems almost rushed as one minute Tom is in NY then LA and then cut, cut, cut suddenly there's a horse's head.. This happens a number of times in the film and probably resulted from studio pressure to reduce the film's running length. Overall though a masterpiece.", "A \"Near\" Perfect Movie": "It's no secret that this is one of the best movies of all time, and any praise that I could bestow upon it will have invariably already been said. The ensemble cast carries forward an amazing plot that perfectly balances the allure of these characters with the dark realities of running a mob. I do have just one point of contention. I can not for the life of me figure out why the plot had Michael Corleone hiding out in Italy, taking him out of the action to put him in a marriage that goes largely no where. He arrives back home and I found myself thinking \"Why did that happen? How did that serve the plot?\", a question I have been unable to answer to this day.", "Amazing.": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.", "NICE ONE": "One of the best... must watch this one 100 percent", "ALL TIME GREAT": "If you ever had to choose a movie for any positive reason whatsoever, choose this movie.

Sadly the movie is weak, and fails to portrait the true essence of the characters, what's so great about the book is that you're able to know and understand the background stories, therefore you identify with the characters behavior to the point where you even forget they're mobsters!! however in the movie many minor and irrelevant scenes take too much time, time that could be used to go a little deeper into the characters, and what's even worst is the total disregard to important passages of the book which didn't even make the movie, or if they did, they were over-synthesized. I don't think I'm the only one that really loved the book, but was sadly disappointed by the movie, still is a movie worth watching, but if you really want to enjoy a great story you should read the book!!", "Exceeded my expectations!": "I mean I expected this movie to make me bored within the first 20 minutes but instead it was great and I loved how the story line always kinda kept you guessing and always seemed to keep going and never seemed to end, but obviously in a good way because it kept me on the edge of my seat.", "The best mafia movie of all time": "This movie is awesome in every detail . The actors make the best movie ever. The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando.", "the greatest ever": "What a incredible movie, this is the movie of the century, i have watched it three times, 10 out of 10, masterpiece, well deserved Oscar, i loved everything about this movie", "good picture": "Hawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit.

So It Is A Great Example Of The Creative Mentality Amongst Italian People During The Modern 20 Century.", "One of the Worst American Films Ever Made": "After experiencing the Godfather many years ago, I finally made my mind up that this might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Taking a humanistic viewpoint on an unbelievable and fictitious Italian family mob, The Corleone's, communicates to me how truly \"unAmerican\" this movie is. Seeing how Michael Corleone (aka Al Pacino's worst role) is experiencing inner dualism between morales and his family showed me how boring this movie really is. When I'm watching a good \"American\" film I want action, not character development! This movie was one big slumber-fest and there wasn't enough boobs!But what truly made me come to this decision was discovering the pile of popcorn and butter vomit that came from my mouth onto my smart phone's IMDb application, after revisiting this so called winner of \"Best Picture,\" \"Best Actor,\" and \"Best Adapted Screenplay.\" Critics of Coppola's uncreative, cookie-cutter, three hour long cheep film cheated and lied to the American population. Make no mistake, this \"Italian\" cultured film is worse than a serving of stuffed calamari in tomato sauce with no garlic, rotten eggs, and a pregnant squid pulled out of the Sarno River. For the those of you spent time to even explore the other two parts of the story, I apologize. When I eventually got up from my imitation leather lazy-boy for a bathroom break all that came out was Marlon Brando's crappy performance. Not to mention Diane Keaton \"expanding\" her acting career... should of stayed with Woody. I feel this movie was pretentious and belittled the American audience. Even Italian film theorist Jean Epstein would probably say, this movie was about as sincere as using Ragu in spaghetti. For my own taste, I'm going to stick with the true mob classics like Corky Romano and Mobsters (with the truly talented Christian Slater). Thanks for the waste of time Francis Ford Coppola!", "Next": "I love the concept and headline for this , it was a great background and plot", "Godfather never gets old.": "This movie is a classic.

I mean come on at least give us some indication that some time is going to pass.3. Did I miss something ? When did they say that Connie and Carlo have had another baby? I don't know maybe it is my mistake but I'm going to point it out anyway.While Michael is still in Italy we can clearly see that Connie is pregnant and is soon going to have a baby.And after Michael returns home the movie jumps forward a few years where we can clearly see that Michael has a 3year old son.But then in one scene Michael is asked to be a godfather to Connies and Carlos son!

TOP CLASS!", "Almost 30 year later, and still the best film ever made": "I'm a member of Generation X and was born the year THE GODFATHER was released.  I didn't see it until about 5 years ago and was mesmerised at the ability of film to translate a tale with such a respect for the characters it is portraying.I believe Francis Ford Coppolla adapted the screenplay along with the author of the original Godfather.  His young, fresh and hungry talent is the reason we have this film today.Every element of the film adds to tell the tale of family and loyalty, memorable characters with settings, wardrobe and cultural experiences that I will enjoy forever.   The rich sadness of \"The Godfather\" theme (composed by Coppolla's father) alone brings tears to my eyes.  The Godfather is the result of a truly gifted filmmaker.In \"the Godfather\" the infallible image of \"Don Corleone\" combined with the performance of a lifetime is horribly disrupted with the multiple attempts on his life.  We see his humanity in the once believed unstoppable Santino Corleone when his own fall takes place.  The growth of character of Michael Corleone is like none other I've ever seen, this innocent school boy, turned in to this cold-blooded killing machine, in the name of \"business.\"\nOnly in film can we, the audience, sympathise with such heartless killers and admire the strength of Sonny, the honourability of the Godfather, and the resurgence of the new Godfather.Who knew a bunch of Italians and non-Italians could come together a portray such a glorious image of an Italian family?And thank God, Francis Ford Copolla stuck to his instincts and prevented Danny Thomas from playing Marlon Brando's part, Burt Reynolds from playing Sonny and Robert Redford(there are blond haired blue eyed italians) from playing Michael.  There's a nobility in the final cast, including his own sister, who plays Connie.  It's a film about loyalty, and family, \"Do you spend time with your family?  Good, because a man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man.\"And for the length?  A film is to transport you into another world, one that you may or may not be familiar with.  For those of us who suffer from short attention fans, you should not see this film.  Films today are about packing as many violent, sexually explicit images, and colourful special effects,as possible in order to entertain the Attention Deficit Generation.  Thank goodness the Godfather was created before this time and thank god there is a segment of society that is able to enjoy the quality of this film.I give this film a 10 out of 10, an honor that no film I have ever seen, besides, The Shawshank Redemption, has ever been bestowed by myself.", "Sometimes it's too slow for my taste, but after all an enchaining story, with great characters.": "First of all, it's been a while since I decided to watch The Godfather, but somehow I've never had enough will power to do so. I heard people saying it's the greatest movie of all time, but I was still being skeptical about this statement, as I couldn't imagine a movie with such long play time grabbing your attention all over it. When it started playing I could sense the outstanding feeling of the early 50's USA. It just felt natural to be part of this world, as we were born to it. The plot is not to be detailed, as it's one of the most famous movies, but I can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of course there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns, there are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with handsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We learn the rules of this world, without directly being taught each of them. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the Corleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive and feel realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting overwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more likely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done, no matter what the morals say. Yes, we can live the life of the Corleones, and that's a thing not every movie can provide. The Godfather is not the best movie of all time, not for me at least. But it surely worth watching, not just because it's a legend, but for why it has become a legend.", "The century's best": "I'll keep it short, this movie is perfect.

All my friends say it's a sick gory film and it's just about men shooting each other. Well they're wrong. It rocks!!! Al Pacino is my favourite actor in the whole world and he plays this character to perfection. I first saw this film when I was 10 (seven years ago) and can't stop watching it ever since. It's not about the crime and the underworld. It's about a family who have the strongest ties to each other and respect each other. It's about family values and issues and who you put first. I've also seen 2 & 3 and they are also cool films but certainly don't come close to this blockbuster.", "A flawless movie that is a pleasure to watch": "This is my favorite movie. This on the surface is a movie about the Mafia, but if you scratch the surface, you realize this is a movie about family and about the consequences of being loyal to your family. Michael in the beginning  is an all-American war hero, who is obviously not part of the family business. Michael transforms so subtly into a murderous, remorseless man, that you don't even notice it until the very end. Every actor is perfect, Brando gives the performance of his life.

It took mob movies to an entirely new level of depth. Plot, dialogue, intrigue, all top notch to compliment the action.

Marlon Brando plays mafia boss Don Vito Corleone who is shot down early in the movie.  The movie then goes on to show how his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is entangled in the world of crime.  This movie is one of the best ever made and has many scenes that are so complex and thought provoking that it, at times, gives me chills.  The Godfather is a movie that should eventually be seen by everyone and I highly recommend it.", "The Greatest Movie of All Time!": "The Godfather movie has to be the greatest movie of all time. Al Pacino is the greatest actor of all time. The story takes you through a rollercoaster ride of feelings and raw imagery.Meagre words can not describe the greatness felt while watching The Godfather... all three of them to be precise.", "Not a great film": "I watched this film because it had a high user rating. I don't get why people find it a good film. For me, it was just a film about people, a family, killing other people. I couldn't take much more away from it than that, sorry. Shawshank is a much better film in every respect. The Godfather is long and drawn out and although it is one of the better gangster films, I would have to say that it is not one that I will watch again. Please let there be someone that agrees with me. From the reviews that I have read there doesn't seem to be a good reason to suggest why this film is voted number one, something that really puzzles me. There are no twists, little to think about, and the film hardly makes you feeling better at the end of it, does it? I've seen much better films than the Godfather although I'm sure, as I seem to be going against popular opinion, I will get heavily criticized for these comments.", "absolutely fantastic!": "The Godfather has been and will stay in my heart as one greatest films of it's type(mob). It tells a complete story with background about Vito's unfortunate life as a boy.I like it!", "An Awesome Movie": "There is nothing to say on this movie, except an awesome movie i ever seen in my life and also hope no movie come like this. I like Micheal corleaon charter and Vito corleaon voice very much. First two movies are awesome but the third one have some disadvantages that's why i didn't like that a lot but that one is good too. A very good family war between five families. Corleaon family manage everything between families. I play GodFather game also but after when i see this movie. Now i am playing it on Kabam.com. I only want to say that i like this movie a a lot that way i do a lot with this movie. I accept that these types of films come in future also so that we give 10 ratings and have some enjoyment in our life.Thanks Regards Sam", "Perfection!!!": "This movie is well deserved of its glittering reputation.  It simply blows its would-be contenders of the same genre (ie. Goodfellas, Casino etc.) out of the water.  It is perfect in every way, from the flawless acting to the stunning cinematography.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a Marlon Brando movie, an Al Pacino movie, a James Caan movie, a Robert Duval movie or a Diane Keaton movie where they turn out a better performance.  And I think that the credit for all of this has to go to the films director, Francis Ford Coppola.  And anyone who tries to tell you that this movie is anything less that the greatest single piece of cinema of all time simply does not know what they are talking about (although the Godfather part 2 comes extremely close...).  So I plead with you, please, please, please go out and rent (or even better, BUY!) this film, even if you have read the book (although if you have done that I suspect you will have seen the movie too!) because I guarantee you will fall in love with it.", "An exercise in morality": "The acting, directing, and script of The Godfather was excellent and beyond reproach. I cannot think of another movie (esp. one that was 3 hrs.) that captivated me and kept me glued to the screen from start to finish.\nHowever, for me the Godfather is an exercise in morality. And by that I do not mean that they are monsters, etc. Although they are no Mahatma Gandhi, they are moral in their own way.Eg. most other gangster movies portray their characters, even the protagonists as womanizers, heavy drinkers, people who get pleasure out of causing pain to others. In short they are portrayed as deplorable and morally corrupt individuals who abuse their power and use it to rise above society. For example in Goodfellas, the mobsters park wherever they want without fear of getting a ticket, they can play loud music without consequence etc.Also, if someone were to insult a Goodfella, then they would be killed or severely injured.However, the Godfather is not so base. The characters (except for Sonny and poss. Fredo) do not indulge themselves in petty vices. You don't see Michael Corleone chasing women, drinking, indulging in violence, etc. And those who do succumb to sensory pleasures come to an unfortunate end. In the end, although Michael is a \"killer\" he only survives because he is disciplined and does not excessively use his power for his own benefit, but only for his family.Also in the Godfather is a Gandhi like forgiveness. Vito, when his son his killed, says \"I want no acts of vengeance.\" Even in part II when he is insulted by the landlord, he is calm. Mike is also calm when he is insulted by others and does not react.\nThe killing in the Godfather can be considered as that of a soldier. Killing is not looked down upon currently in western society. Warfare is accepted. People kill animals for food. The west frequently engages in warfare to \"protect\" others. Some even argue that the US never has humanitarian interests in mind when it goes into another far away country, but is only acting to protect its own interests and force its philosophy upon others.\nIn this way, the killings committed by the Corleone family pale in comparison to what the government does. And what the govt. does is no secret. It is accepted by the American people!So according to this line of reasoning, it makes no sense to criticize the Godfather for violence, both on the part of the filmmaker and the characters.This movie helped me realize, when i was much younger, that real power is not boisterous and loud, and does not assert itself even when provoked. On the contrary, the person who does not react when confronted and insulted by others, holds the trump card and is the real victor. Gandhi knew this. And the fictional Corleone family knew this and that is why they were the best!!!!", "Very nice Cast!": "The Godfather is a 1972 film based on the homonym book Mario Puja. Was director Francis Ford Coppola and starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The film is considered one of the best films of all time. In March 2010 page Internet Movie Database1 is rated by users with 9.1, extent to which he holds the second place. Since the film also has stay the phrase had said Don \u00abI'm going to make him an offer he can not refuse \u00bb(I'll make an offer that can not be refuse), which was voted as the second most memorable phrase in the history of cinema. Very nice Cast! Thank you! The Godfather is a 1972 film based on the homonym book Mario Puja.", "mafia-heaven": "Let the film speak for himself. those who've seen him understand me. perfectly told, a great intensity marvelously shot, great cinematography", "Absolutely Fantastic": "About a month ago , i found the trilogy of The Godfather on tape, it was at a cheap price so i bought it. It was one of the best purchases i have made this year. This is THE best trilogy of all time. Even if you dont like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino or James Caan's other movies, you should check out this one, it is great , i hope you will enjoy it has much has me.", "A Must See": "I recently watched the film The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and based on the book by Mario Puzo. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The film takes place in New York in a post-World War II setting. The films is a stirring drama filled with poignant moments throughout.This film follows the lives of the Corleone family who is one of the five organized crime families that control the city and state of New York. This film takes you through the good and the bad sides of an organized crime family. The film has moments where you forget that this family is a mob family who commits murders like others commit minor traffic violations. Some of the more memorable scenes in the movie include the very opening scene in the movie when The Godfather (Vito Corleone) is sitting in a dark home office setting where he is receiving any guest to his daughter's wedding who has a request for him. Apparently there is an old Sicilian tradition that says that a father cannot refuse any reasonable request on the day that his daughter is to be married. Why haven't I been invited to more Italian weddings? I'm getting really tired of dealing with my wife telling me to clean up after I make a mess. Where is a Godfather when you need him? Another scene that caught my attention is a meeting that the Corleone family has with a man by the name of Sollozzo. This man has an offer for the family to begin moving the family into the drug business. The scene gets me because you would think that a mob boss would be up for whatever if it means making money, but not Don Corleone. He almost seems like a respectable business man who would not do anything that has to do with drugs. This scene is pivotal as it sets in motion the events of the rest of the movie. Upon the refusal of Sollozzo's offer he sets up an assassination attempt on The Godfather's life which is carried out but fails as the Don lives through the attempt. After the assassination attempt there has to be a reaction from the family and to everyone's surprise this gets Michael Corleone involved in the family business that he swore he would never be involved with. Michael's involvement leads him to carry out the assassination of Sollozzo and the chief of police. This act of vengeance leads Michael to a yearlong hide out in Italy while the rest of the family and their associates go to the mats for a bitter mob war. There are many other moments in the film to be seen and the film moves in a very unpredictable way that has to be seen rather than told in a film review.One of the best aspects of the movie is the background music that plays at certain times in the movie. It is nothing that is going to blow you away, and it isn't anything that you are going to recognize unless you are familiar with some sort of dark orchestra that I have never heard of before. The movie plays music at the right times and it does an amazing job of building the suspense of the scenes where it has been included. One example is toward the end of the movie when Michael's nephew is being baptized and the movie is going through a series of parallel cuts and the music does an amazing job of building the suspense during this scene. This is a classic example of someone doing their homework and realizing that sometimes music can be done to the point of overkill. No worries of that here just a great job by the sound crew.Another fine job in the movie is the acting. The cast of this movie was brilliantly put together and each character is played absolutely brilliantly. From The Godfather down to the Mafioso's who work for him each character is played with precision and by men and women who seem to fit the roles that they were cast for as if they were leading their normal lives. The casting crew gets a round of applause from me for the job that they did with this film.The Godfather is a film that will stand the test of time when it comes to motion pictures. With a brilliant plot and a moving storyline this movie is one of the best that I have ever seen. The characters portray a group that seem for all intents and purposes to be a real family who love and care about one another while going about their daily lives of committing murders and breaking the law. This film will be one of the greats of all time and it will leave viewers with a sense of wanting to be a part of a crime syndicate like the Corleone family. I encourage anyone who enjoys movies that tell a story in a moving and powerful way to go and see The Godfather. I promise that you will not be disappointed and you will be begging for more by the time that the movie is over. My overall film rating for this movie is a resounding 5 out of 5 trigger fingers because I think that they work better for this movie than stars or thumbs. Go see the movie and enjoy!", "THE Movie of the Century": "If and when the world comes to an end, I truly hope a copy of the Godfather is found among the ruins. This movie of which I have seen over 100 times since it's release in '72 has displayed the best of a well put together story about family. This family just happens to be into organized crime. If you have never seen the movie, rent it and relax and let yourself be taken away by the gripping story which is nonstop from beginning to end (of course Godfather II picks up right where this one stops). a 10 in my book now and forever.", "The greatest crime movie ever made": "I am a huge movie fan and all my friends know that this film is my most favourite. Every performance is superb and every line is a classic. The images are the work of a great cinematic artist and the unforgettable score perfectly frames his work. I have watched this movie many times and look forward to many more viewings. Truly, the greatest crime movie ever made.", "The Godfather is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.": "Being a young man I have not been blessed with being able to see The Godfather when it was originally released, and the thought of seeing this epic on the big screen makes me drool. The story is what drives this masterpiece, not special effects like todays so called epics. I was glued to the my television, watching this film. After you watch this film you find yourself whistling the main theme, and going around talking like Don Corleone. It is a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone tired of todays movies with no story.", "there is no better film.end of story.": "\"The Godfather\",and lots of people will agree with me,is the greatest movie ever made.there aren't many people who didn't see that movie,there aren't many people who won't see that movie more then once.it is hard to explain what there is in that movie that makes it so great.maybe it's the directing,maybe it's the wonderfull players,maybe it's the music,maybe it's mario puzo's great story about the Italian mafia family and it's life in America,and maybe it's the mix of all of them together.it's never mind. what do mind,is Francis Ford Coppola,that in his own way managed to create one of the most excellent art works in the history of humanity. this movie gets eaziely a rank of 10 out of ten stars.", "The greatest...": "Before seeing Godfather for the first time I had never seen a serious movie like that. I was only 13 and my tastes haden't quite matured yet. Since then, I've developed a great love for the movies. The Godfather has led me to such classics as Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and many more. But Godfather, in my eyes, is the best of them all.", "Superb cinematography, acting, and plot.": "This is probably one of the finest films I've ever seen.  Truly it's a classical masterpiece of cinematography and really gripping plot.  This movie not only launched the careers of the actors, but also affirmed the heavyweights as well.  It beautifully portrays the value of family, with romance, politics, and certainly blatant war. Yet, the movie is almost poetic, with violent scenes that don't drench you in gore, and a language that isn't in your face.  Simply put, it's what every great action/drama film should be.  A must-see for every true film goer.", "Brilliant, Best Movie Ever": "I've seen nearly 40 of the top 50 films on the AFI list, and although I'm no authoritarian on the subject I say without a doubt this is the most profound film in memory. If not for the fact that this movie is about Italians, better yet corrupt ones this would have been #1 on any virtually any reputable list. Everything comes together, there is no flaw. Citizen Kane was also brilliant, but it had flaws. How often is there a Godfather reference on tv? in a conversation? I can talk to anyone for hours about this film. This is the standard, this is the benchmark.", "An intense epic of loyalty and the cost of betrayal.": "Based on the old style Sicilian mafia, Francis Ford Coppola directs Mario Puzo's novel \"The Godfather\" into the dramatic tale of Sicilian Godfather Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).  Coppola and Puzo convey the importance of loyalty to the family, the cost of betrayal, and ever-present power of organized crime rings.", "One of the greatest movie of all time.": "Hello movie freaks, this is my first ever movie review on IMDb. As I am novice in writing, excuse me for my unintelligent writing. As a first review post I wanted to choose an important and popular movie, so I choose THE GODFATHER.This is only a film where audience can attach emotionally to a DON's life.Film starts with a sequence where people came to greet and meet Don Vito Carleone and request him to fulfill their desires. In between the scenes we got to know that all the visitors came to attend the wedding of Don's daughter.It would have been very important occasion in any father's life but even at this occasion also Don shows his generosity and kindness who came to his asylum. This film shows how man is hunger for power and how a man turned violent to protect his family.THE GODFATHER is best of all his genres not only for its story but also for performances,editing,cinematography and above all for its direction. I don't think that other then the Francis Ford Coppola could have done this.", "Review of The Godfather by 13 year old Errett Goff": "Coppola has given us the most wonderful thing anyone associated with film techniques could ask for- the perfect movie. I say this on three points.1. The Story. Of all of America's past times, gangsters and the Mafia have been two of the most controversial and painful to express. You don't see often in the history books about the \"Five Families.\"  In fact, America has not portrayed the power of the crime lords in the late forties until now. Coppola has done something unreal. As \"Some Like it Hot\" was origionally panned because it's fingers touched on the brutality of gangsters and crime a little too much, the Godfather has taken what Some- left in the box. 2. the cast. Brando has never performed as well as now. this should be the highlight and acme of his career. yet he refused his oscar on account of the rights of Native Americans. Pacino delivered a highly riviting, and somehow psychological performance as he stepped into the spotlite. Duval played his game as the perfect partner. Caan portrayed his violent, yet human character so welll, when he was gunned down, i did not know whether to laugh or cry. as for the rest, i only have 1000 words so... 3. the reality if anyone has ever seen the movie \"The Untouchables\" and the amount of blood exposed, you have only seen the beginning. the Mafia were some bad dudes, anyone knows that. but the realisim in this picture is so wonderful. the tension between siblings, the violence and paranoia of a man with his dying father in a hospital he thinks is about to be invaded by gang busters, the murder of the brother in law because he was in the wrong \"family\" it astounds me. I give The Godfather ***** five stars (out of five) there is nothing more i can say, you would have to see it to beleive itthank you for your time Errett Goff the Oarman", "Who is really the Godfather when referring to the film's title?": "Spectacular performance from Al Pacino.  It's not only about the mafia, the crime nor the ambitions of men, it's about the family. Many people has argued that the Godfather is in reference to Brando and some would disagree and say it was Pacino.  See the movie and judge for yourself.  Two thumbs up!!!", "This is a very good movie.": "It's a movie with an intense, intense storyline.This movie slowly progresses and gradually becomes more and more intense until the end of the story.This is one of my favorite movies.", "Most fantastic film": "Cinematography is excellent\nActing is the most fantastic from brando & pacino\nExcellent from the others\nAnd very excellent from director mr Coppola", "Masterpiece nothing less": "This movie is my most favourite movie and for good reasons, first of all kudos to the actors in this movie and Marlo Brando for smashing it outside the stadium.As for the plot, the mafia family crime thriller drama intrigued me so much, the directing style of Frank Ford Coppola, the mesmerizing scores help to elevate the movie watching experience more than anything.A MUST WATCH.", "The best movie of all-time": "Really classic. Magnificent portrait of organized crime. A must-see gangster movie.", "GOOD!": "For those critics who are against violent Mafia films and choose not to watch them, that is fine, but it should be considered that there is more to this movie than meets the eye.

It kinda had me in the start but lost me afterwards. I guess it's goos in other aspects of filmmaking but I watch a movie for entertainment.", "GOOD. MOVIE": "A must see.

Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia.But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best- seller to the big screen.He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.There's also something special about how the film interacts with the viewer, and it's hard to exactly explain what it is; it's an unusual tone. I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes: the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music. I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.Do not miss this movie.", "I wasn't a fan but then I realised": "Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.", "Dream classic movie": "Few movies that get my attention and makes me day dream about, and Godfather i,ii, and iii sure does that to me. I would lay in bed, office, or school and think about some memory moments during the movie, i.e., \"oof maroon only if I can have the bag of money\" as it is truly one of the many best moments in Godfather during the wedding, the driver for the Godfather wished he can rob the bag of money gifts which had all cash in it. Honestly, all mob movies make me and gets me so excited as it always has and always will. There is this special connection I really can't figure out what it really is, but for what its worth its there. If you watch mob movies and those that are classic you can relate to what am saying. All and all Godfather will always stay in a special place in my heart and my kids future. As I will make sure my son watches it as soon he turns 18. Because it has real, true, manly life lessons we can all learn a few things from.

Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket.

Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles, a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome dona Carleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze, his smooth gestures, his unique voice and his unforgettable \"bulldog jaw\" forever blended into the image of the viewer.Don Carleone - this is Marlon Brando - sloven and lover in life, but on the screen - a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone - a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster, who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way.

The Godfather Part II was, from conception upwards, an insane project. But it worked.\nWhen I watched this movie I was amazed that how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role of it has been played by a famous and good actor before. And most problem to play younger Don was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando.", "Superb film, a lesson for us all!": "This film has so much details that a viewer cannot understand.\nWhat can i say.

He did a great job in it. Especially when he kicked Carlo's ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino's amazing career. Everybody remembers James Cann for his role, and the same for Marlon Brando's role.

And the Godfather's influence does not only lay in English speaking countries. For example, as someone of Turkish descent, I have noticed that many of Turkey's mafia-based TV shows are influenced by this masterpiece.", "The Oscar-winning 1972 masterpiece about the Corleone family": "THE GODFATHER,\" which has been re-released on its 25th anniversary, is a jewel that still glows across time -- and in the dark. Gordon Willis's cinematography, considered revolutionary at the time, plunged its characters into pools of semi-darkness. Studio executives -- always the last ones to get it -- howled in the screening rooms. But in this saga of an Italian-American family's bid for power, we were watching the American Dream operating in the darkest shadows.Luckily, America saw the light. The movie, released in March 1972 and directed by an unknown eccentric called Francis Ford Coppola, was a smash hit -- the first film to top $100 million in its initial release. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation). It lit a fire under the careers of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. It entered the pantheon of American cinema; and it has informed virtually every crime movie in the last quarter century, from \"Scarface\" to \"Donnie Brasco.\"In the story, which Mario Puzo and Coppola adapted from Puzo's novel, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) presides over a tight-knit clan which includes his hotheaded eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), his adopted son and family adviser, Tom Hagen (Duvall), and youngest son, Michael (Pacino), the apple of his father's eye who has -- thus far -- been kept out of the family business.That business happens to be prostitution, protection rackets and gambling. In a constant struggle for power among New York's rival gangster families, Don Corleone rules with Machiavellian grace.When adversaries refuse his wishes, he \"makes them an offer they can't refuse.\" The procedure is simple: His goons point a gun against the head of anyone who needs persuasion. But Don Corleone is also a benevolent figure who -- in this morally relative underworld -- rights the wrongs of his friends and relatives.Into this world comes Michael, the returning war hero (the year is 1946), who finally agrees to take his father's mantle and run the family. His ascension is the stuff of American cinematic myth. Standing before his father, who lies in a hospital bed after barely surviving an attempt on his life, Michael kisses Don Corleone's hand and whispers, \"I'm with you now.\"Coppola, then in his thirties, reluctantly heeded the advice of his friend George Lucas to make this picture. To him, this was a commercially unpalatable project that had nothing to do with his personal ambition: to change the way Hollywood made movies.How wrong he was. There are volumes that could be written -- and have been -- about the movie's uniformly powerful performances; its precedent-setting editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; Nino Rota's haunting score; and Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design. But Coppola must get most of the credit.With Puzo, he forged an epic tragedy about America, capitalism, family, greed, treachery and love. He showed us -- with almost Shakespearean gravitas -- the errors of hasty vengeance and the wisdom of assured leadership. He gave us a great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. There are too many to choose from, but I leave you with two here: When Michael -- hearing about the assault on his father -- scrambles into a telephone booth to call the family, his girlfriend (Diane Keaton) waits outside in the cold. It's clear that she's literally being kept out of the picture. Much later, when a door is closed between her and her husband -- as he conducts family business -- this estrangement is not only reconfirmed, it sets us up for \"The Godfather, Part II,\" a movie that achieved the impossible: to equal its predecessor.", "Cool !": "The Best Movie I Ever Seen In my entire Life I don't Know its Just Awesome !!", "great movie, weak plot": "This is one of my favorite movies. However, the last time I saw it, I was disappointed to spot a serious flaw in the plot that I never realized before. It seems that not many people have. The movie is still so great, that this blunder is forgivable. But, at least for me, it will never be the same again. If you read any further, you may be as disappointed as I was.When Michael decides to try and kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he assumes that the three will be alone in a restaurant without further protection from the Sollozzo family, so Michael will be able to walk away after shooting them down. This assumption is completely unfounded; for all the Corleones know, the place could have been packed with Sollozzo men. The whole plan revolves around the idea that they will be able to find out the place of the meeting in advance, which was to be unilaterally chosen by the enemy. Well, in the event, the Corleones do find the name of the restaurant. They still assume their victims will have no protection, and now they know where the three will be. What could be easier than sending a couple of men there to do the deed, instead of planting the gun for the inexperienced Michael, which is patently a riskier approach? No group of thugs would have overlooked this. In the movie, the option is not even mentioned.", "A classic!": "This is a classic film and the actors are truly amazing. An epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare.

At least because of private mentions, references and parodies, almost everyone knows that there is such a film and about what it is about. However, if you read a brief description of the picture or do not watch the movie very carefully, you may get the impression that this is an ordinary film about bandits. So what makes this movie great? The answer is how it was filmed, staged and with what references to world culture.Indeed, this simple, at first glance, movie about the path of one of the criminal families in the USA of the middle of the last century begins to play with completely new colors, if you carefully look behind the scenes, how it is staged by the director, what and why the actors say and what symbolism there is in all these scenes. And then, lo and behold, the cinema is transformed. In the way mafia boss don Carleone sits, you can see paintings by Caravaggio, the number of biblical references is difficult to count, and banal bandits for the first time at that time for cinema appear before the viewer as complex and dramatic characters, as if from the pen of Shakespeare.", "GodFather": "This movie change my life.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.", "The Godfather is Amazing": "You thinking why I am said The Godfather is amazing when You Show then you know why I am said the godfather is amazing.", "loved it": "This was a great film. i encourage others to watch them all.", "Best movie f the decade": "I have seen so many movies but I found Godfather the best in terms of direction, filming and concept as I myself is the Film Director and I have a movie studio with the Name of Wow Now Productions based in New Zealand.I would recommend to all the great directors to watch this movie to get an epic idea for the future.This year I am making a full feature film and our last movie won Six international awards.Looking for great actors who can work in my movie, its a love story based on true incidents.You can comment here if you are interested.Thanks for reading this review, hope to get in touch soon.", "During Roth's birthday party": "During Roth's birthday party, the pattern on his shirt changes.

Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances.The first scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, and gives the viewer an early insight as to what to expect through the movie. It starts off in a dark room where the face of an old friend of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the old friend was begging Don Vito to help him deliver justice to the two men who had beaten his daughter. Don Vito Corleone was offended that his old friend had gone to the police for help before coming to him. However, when his friend explains he was scared to because he desired to live an honest life in America, but when a judge gives the two men suspended sentences, he knows the only way to punish these men was to go to Don Vito Corleone. It is apparent from the beginning that Don Vito Corleone is a dangerous man, but he is also shown as a compassionate man, when he agrees to help his old friend, but tells him he may one day ask for a favor in return for his help. The favor he asks from his old friend is one that will shock the audience!That same day, the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter was going on, and after the meeting with his friend, he went out for a family picture. Another soft side of the godfather is revealed as he puts off the family picture until his son Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Michael shows up dressed in a military uniform and is the only member of the family not involved in the family crime business. An exciting sequence of events changes that, however.This movie from start to finish is full of excitement and surprises, and it starts when Don Vito Corleone once again shows he has morals and refuses to involve his family in the drug trade. Not all the New York families process these morals, and the bloody feud ensues, which leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat anticipating what is going to happen next. This movie is not for the faint hearted, but it shows both sides of a crime family, from the love they share for their children, wife's, and other family members, to the murderous rages, which can be triggered at any moment. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino put in stunning performances' which is supported from the excellent supporting actors.' With 32 awards, which include three Academy Awards, and 19 nominations for awards, it would not be an exaggeration to say The God Father is one of the best movies of all time.

Don Corleone: What is that? \"Bonasera whispers his request in the Don's ear\" That I cannot do. Bonasera: I will give you anything you ask. Don Corleone: We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And, uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble.Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend like me. But, uh, now you come to me, and you say: \"Don Corleone, give me justice.\" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money.Bonasera: I ask for justice. Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive. Bonasera: Let them suffer then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you? Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that wounded your daughter would be suffering this very day.

Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day \u2013 accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.Bonasera: Grazie, Godfather.

A lesson in filmmaking is sampled from many ivy league and big ten schools to highlight a new direction in storytelling in American cinema.", "The movie deserved 6.5 to 7/10": "Not as I expected, this movie showed me one of the greatest actors I've ever seen such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, etc.. but I didn't see that the story is great. Also, there was a problem with the time in this movie, you have to watch the first 18 minutes of the wedding scene which was so boring to be completely honest. Also, the story didn't show me the past of Vito Corleone, which I saw in The Godfather: Part II. The event of this movie was so slow and the story in some scenes becomes boring and not understandable. So, I give this Masterpiece (What people call it) 6.5 to 7 stars out of 10.", "Pure Brilliance": "A cinematic Masterpiece. Every character is incredible and diverse and other movies should strive to be this great.", "The acting may have been better": "The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.", "The Third best movie of all time, and the best gangster movie of all time": "The BEST Mob movie of all time.

Even that early in the year you knew that is was going to be the best movie of the year and that Marlon Brando had the best performance all year. It was such a good movie that before they finished filming they planned The Godfather Part II. Another good thing about this movie is that even though there is countless mistakes it is still number 3 on America's Film Instunte's Top 100 movies of all time.

There's no break in the movie, and the necessary violence for a gangster movie is there, a lot!Also, you can see the true talent of some actor. I think, without a doubt that it's the best Marlon Brando' movie ever. He's terrifying in that Godfather role and yet, you can see that he's a man that care entirely for his family and also that he's a man of conviction And we can those traits of character because Marlon Brando act it perfectly.

I personally like the movie.", "REVIEW": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.", "The best film Ever": "I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Godfather it is the best movie ever i saw, its encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.

You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

Not a single scene or a line is unnecessary in the whole film. The direction, casting, plot, music, cinematography, acting, lines, everything seems just perfect. Al Paccino and Brando simply were born for their roles. But please don't bother to watch this epic film if you do like movies with extreme violence, sense less killing, unnecessary car chases and the hero fighting ten people at a time with bare hands. This film is totally in a different league, you simply cannot compare it to any other crime or gangster movie ever made. The way Al Paccino transformed himself from a subtle, educated and sophisticated Italian American into a typical Italian mafia boss, is without a doubt one of the best performances of all times.", "This is my favorite movie": "I have seen the electricity many times and let people around me watch it several times.

Let me give you a hint why the trilogy of Lord of the Rings is better than the Godfather trilogy. Godfather part III a big time loser!!!You don't even have to be a fanatic filmgoer to see and realize that. The movie was clumsy and boring to a point that it was almost clear to me that Coppola wanted desperately to make his trilogy without having a clue of what he was doing. That reminds me of another 80'ties character called George Lucas (see Star Wars-saga). Maybe Coppola was trying to take the quote from Alfred Hitchcock a bit too literally, when he said that style in film is to plagiarise yourself. Godfather III is a recollection of scenes we saw before in a different outfit, adding some cheap cosa nostra crap that did not work, like the fake set-up scene with the helicopter. This is the moment where by unbelievable coincidence the Godfather and Sonny's son came out without a scratch. This is not the same kind of realism I saw in I and II. While Return of the King is the climatic moment of the trilogy, Godfather III was its lowpoint.This is Hollywood wanting to sell tickets the cheap way, betting on a sure thing.  And what about the story? What is it? Financial corruption at the Vatican? It is nothing more than an expensive soap-opera. So what if he did it the traditional way. He should of realized that he had no good story.\nIt is not because the actors from the Godfather trilogy received Oscars for their performances and probably LOTR not is because the actors from the first trilogy did a better job than the others. It has nothing to do with it. The whole show is not about rewarding talent, but to uphold a tradition of celebrating those who are loyal to the spirit of Hollywood. LOTR has but conformed to one tradition, the one from Middle-Earth, in a galaxy far far from Hollywood.Let's not forget however to point out that Coppola is responsible for putting his daughter in the film who given us a stunning insight in how bad acting can be. Fortunately for her she has proven, she is much better off directing films. Even Pacino doesn't bring a good performance. While in Godfather II he brought us a believable and likeable anti-hero, while in part III he doesn't do anything else than shouting.There are unforgettable scenes in the Godfather trilogy. But so there are far better scenes in LOTR, and probably in a way future generations will get inspired in how to make a sensible symbiosis between technique and story, in the same spirit of Hitchcock and Welles, who both were neglected by The Academy of Motion Pictures. If you talk about memorable scenes, look at how Peter Jackson brought us Gollem. It brakes again new boundaries for visual effects and surpasses even the matrix by far. Phantasy has never been that real since ever. And the examples could go on and on.Part III doesn't bring anything new, while LOTR innovate at every turn. LOTR is not the typical Hollywood film. In fact, it is not a Hollywood film at all. But It is a pure refreshing experience and a great motivation for a lot of young filmmakers.", "Godfather I": "A Classic...the best movie ever.

There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadn't seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic.

It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected.

In the decennial 2002 Sight & Sound poll of film directors, the pair was ranked as the second best film of all time. Previous Mafia movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider.

It's one of those movies that you would always hear people talk about and wondered 'what's all the hype - could a movie that was made prior to your birth really be that great?' Well, at least that is what I wondered. I never understood the fascination with Al Pacino, well at least until I watched this film. When I first laid eyes and ears on the first one, I could not put it down. I must have watched it at least 10 times consecutively and just fell in love with it's powerful and captivating presence. There is a reason that this film is on the top of the IMDb Charts. All the pieces that make this film so brilliant somehow magically fell into place when this film was made. For such a great director such as Francis Ford Coppola to come across one of the 20th century's greatest novels - The Godfather was destiny. Francis knew to truly captivate mastermind he wouldn't go it alone for the script. Yes, he dove passionately into the project and a lot of the film's ideas were sparked and derived by initial interest. But being the fanatical director that Coppola was, he set sail to take the project into timeless space. To do this, he knew he had to include Mario Puzo (author of the Godfather book) in on the script. Even casting took Coppola by storm and he was in for much labored conflict and tough decisions in order to see out his vision. Hollywood being Hollywood and Paramount in it's scope originally rejected the idea of casting young and unrecognized actor Al Pacino to play the role of Michael. But Coppola knew better and thus fought hard to keep him in. Thank goodness because any other actor could not play such an untouchable role that only Al Pacino could fill; The makings of such a dynamic and powerful role. Marlon Brando was probably the sure-shot out of the whole cast and well, Marlon Brando certainly pulled through. For me, it's Marlon Brandon's lack of presence in the 2nd that makes the first topple the second. The beginning of Godfather one with Marlon Brandon as \"The Don\" Vito Corleone sitting at his desk addressing Bonasera's request before he steps out for his daughter's wedding is simply timeless. That powerful message which in it's own right from the film and in the book carries even deeper and more powerful messages in analogies and sub-meanings is delivered on a timeless measure that puts chills down your spine almost every time you watch it. That deeply rooted sub-context makes it tireless, restless and relentless enough where hearing it a billion times is not enough.

Pacino had made movies before and was a respected New York stage actor, but this was his breakthrough movie. Brando was regarded as poison: he was impossible to work with, causing movies to lose money with his outrageous demands, so the studio execs despised and distrusted him. This movie, for which he had to suffer the humiliation of auditioning, resurrected him. It opened the door to the memorable \"Last Tango in Paris.\" Of course we had all seen Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale in other movies, but this one made them stars. (I don't recall seeing Talia Shire before this.) And it gave Coppola the kind of artistic freedom that would lead to \"Godfather II\"--another masterpiece. Puzo, who wrote the book and collaborated on the screenplay, would go on to do the scripts for \"Superman\" and other movies. It was magic for everyone who appeared in it. I am only sorry that the success it brought people like Marlon Brando and Richard Castellano led them to price themselves out of \"Godfather II.\"", "the bes tittlle ever": "Graeat. this film is clasical. very good. you can see the cuture of good father and all he have for the go to the top of money and power", "One of the best movies in gangster genre": "Very well written screenplay and one of the best cinematography", "Requires Serious Mind to Understand this Masterpiece": "No words can define this movie it's100/10 and i still think this rating is way less and who am I to rate this movie.", "AMAZING MOVIE": "The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say.

This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout.

This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history.

His face was cold with majestic contempt. But there was something false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand.\"You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,\" the judge said harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animals.Animals. The two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed clean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their heads in submission.The judge went on. \"You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor girl or I'd put you behind bars for twenty years.\" The judge paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered slyly toward the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then lowered to a stack of probation reports before him. He frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke again.\"But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, and because the law in its majesty does not seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years' confinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.\"Only forty years of professional mourning kept the overwhelming frustration and hatred from showing on Amerigo Bonasera's face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the hospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these two animals went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they were all happy now, they were smiling now.The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera's throat, overflowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was standing so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, confident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the fresh linen against his mouth.The parents of the animals were coming by now, two men and two women his age but more American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, triumphant defiance.Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward toward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, \"You will weep as I have wept--- I will make you weep as your children make me weep\"--- the linen at his eyes now. The defense attorneys bringing up the rear swept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if to protect their parents. A huge bailiff moved quickly to block the row in which Bonasera stood. But it was not necessary.All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in law and order. And he had prospered thereby. Now, though his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a gun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of his skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife and explained to her, \"They have made fools of us.\" He paused and then made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. \"For justice we must go on our knees to Don Corleone.\"", "bo phim cua thoi gian": "Xem di xem lai den hon 10 nam roi ma bo phim nay van cu cuon hut su tap trung phim nhu ngay dau moi xem.\nGood film", "EPIC MOVIE": "Still one of the best movies to date, one of my favorite.

Get the concept of the good and the bad", "Wasn't overly impressed": "Let me tell you first and foremost that I have viewed plenty mafia movies, not to mention I own several as well. The first thing I have to say about the Godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab, its almost as the Director is trying to make Americans fall in love with criminals,not to mention a bad display of Italian Americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as Goodfellas. The question we must ask ourselves is\"Are Italians really that thick headed and vulgar?\" and the answer is a resounding no. You almost get the impression that Vito Corleone is a homosexual and that James Canns Character has a mental diffieciency. The only good character depicted in the movie was Al Pacinos part. A man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond me.The only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which I thank Francis for", "XUY": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.", "Screenplay": "I like the screen play of that movie it is just not a movie it is the best play ever I watch any movie before with this type of screen play", "100/100": "The best movie ever !!!\nActors,music and everything amazing !", "Top One for me!": "Everyone does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.", "Excellence!": "A true cinematic masterpiece! A movie that holds up strongly through time. Brando's performance was impeccable! One of the best casts in the history of cinema. This movie was done with the passion that lacks on film making nowadays and thats why it will live forever. It deals with the core of society through a dangerous and loving family. There is just a few film makers out there that keep this true formula alive today and let's hope there is more to come. Coppola has yet to come back and delight us with more. We need more movies like this! Get inspired filmmakers, the world is yours. A movie that changed American film making forever.", "A Tour de Force": "The Godfather is not a perfect film. It is similar to the original Star Wars in that while it's flawed, its originality and cultural impact cannot be overlooked.This film creates a dark and realistic atmosphere that lays the frame for a story filled with love, betrayal, and plenty of twists along the way. While the slower pace and dialogue-driven plot isn't for everyone, those who have the patience and attention to detail will not be disappointed.", "One of my favorites.": "One of the best movie's of all time!!!!

When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.", "La Mejor Pelicula en su Genero": "Esta pel\u00edcula muestra claramente el valor de la lealtad aun en tiempos dif\u00edciles y lo importante que puede ser la familia .", "This might be insane but.......": "I think this movie is better than every other movie put together.

They are all four considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME by their generation!(They are all four historical dramas with plenty of realistic violence, insanity,love, hate, sex & bad language.) By the same logic there must be a \"greatest movie of all time\" to those born in the 1970's as well as those born in the 1980's.

The music in connection with the movie is just perfect. The whole part in Sicily is realistic and well done. I love that all the people speak italian there. The film is a brand new thing on his own.

He definitely showed us that he would be one of the greatest actors of his generation. Al teamed up with Marlon Brando, a great from his generation, Cinematic heaven.It was a great start to the trilogy and an even better start to Mr. Coppola's career.", "Why this movie will CHANGE your life!": "Have you ever questioned yourself as to why we are here? The answer is simple, watch this movie to find out exactly what I mean.Family, honor, respect, loyalty, and most important of all FAITH! A man needs these basic and crucial aspects in his life. How can a building stand without a base, how can a car run without any gas? Everything has an action and reaction in life. You can let things go by or you can approach everything with confidence and reassurance from your base. A mans' family is his base, his love is infrastructure, and his faith is his concrete overlay. A man has three great possessions in life, those being love, family,and faith. Once he acquires that he will then begin to realize those loyal to him also respect him. This movie taught me fear isn't as good as respect. When people fear you; it'll only take one person to not be afraid and stand up to you to cause you to lose it all. Meanwhile respect held at such a higher platform could never be taken away. Knowledge is power, power gains respect and respect gets you paid.In conclusion this movie will definitely change the way you hold your values in life. Some for good, others for worse.Without all three of those it would be impossible for anyone to survive.

A haunting music score that reverberates in your mind through the years. A screenplay that never lets up. And a rollicking great story.Nothing can take away from the impact of the dead stallion in the movie producer's bed. Or the simple tension evident in Pacino's demeanour during the famous dinner with Salozzo.I must have watched this movie over a hundred times. You know what, I'll probably see it a few score times more. This one is never going to be topped.Extraordinary!!", "The Godfather(1972) IS THE BEST FATHER !!": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.", "Must Watch!": "This is one of the best movies made till date.

The cast is incredible, the acting is above average, and the movie itself makes it hard to believe that it made it's debut in 1972.It also gives us an unforgettable line from Marlon Brando that is now known throughout the world- \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\"To call this movie overrated is a real shame; it is (in my opinion and in many others) the greatest 'mafia movie' ever made. Mario Puzzo and Francis Ford Coppola should be very proud men after making a movie of this caliber.", "This is one of the only films that I believe that everyone should watch before they die.": "The Godfather, released in 1972, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and screenwritten by Mario Puzo is a masterpiece; In fact, I would claim that this is the best film in the history of cinema. Upon its release it was an instant smash hit, it became the first film to top $100 million in its initial release. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation). Today, more than forty five years after its original showing in theaters, It continues to be as influential, popular and successful as it's ever been. This movie changed Hollywood, it has influenced hundreds of movies and completely reshaped mob movies as a whole.The Godfather \"Don\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael (Al Pachino), Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.Coppola's epic storytelling is magnificent. There is an electric charge in simply the shift from New York to California to Sicily and back to New York. It's a simple yet gripping and gut wrenching story. It's as good as can be. Every single character, inside and outside the Corleone family is extremely well written. They are all well rounded characters with their own motivations and feelings, who undergo a complete transformation through the film. I believe that Michael's character arc is the best in all of cinema history, we witness a man truly change influenced by his surroundings and current circumstances. The music, lighting, camera angles and specially the props are carefully used to support what the the director is trying to show us and how he wants to make us feel.At a surface level the props blend in with the environment perfectly, it is only under intense analysis that the brilliance of them and the reason for their use are clear. Let's take cigarettes as an example. The moments when Michael Corleone chooses to smoke are exceptional, deliberate moments: the action is in fact something intended by Coppola and not something done randomly. Cigarettes represent Michaels symbolic power; a cigarette consumes; it burns; it has the potential to kill and destroy. In one scene for example Enzo, the baker, and Michael are standing in front of the hospital, they have just impeded an attack on Don Corleone. Enzo, shocked by the events that just transpired, is uncontrollably shaking as he is trying to light his cigarette; Michael calmly grabs his lighter and proceeds to light Enzo's cigarette after which, he lights his own. This scene lasts about twenty seconds yet its effects are massive. The juxtaposition of Enzo's shaking hands with Michael's steady hands underlines that Michael is capable of staying rational, calm, collected, and cool in every situation. The fact that Micheal is in full control of himself is clearly established here.To give another example of how perfect the props are we have to fast forward in the movie. Vito Corleone's loss of power is reflected in his physical appearance and presentation. During the first scene of the movie, the fact that Vito is a powerful figure is as clear as crystal. He wears an elegant suit, and his hair neatly slicked back. By contrast, this scene presents Vito in casual clothing, and with unruly hair sticking out of his hat. This simple change of clothes makes him look completely different; he looks weak, powerless and exhausted. Soon after, Vito tragically collapses in his garden on top of some tomato plants and dies. This again has a meaning, it encapsulates the entirety of vitos life in a quick scene. Vito has done everything in his power to plant, care for, and grow the seeds of his personal and business life. He has successfully laid the foundation of his empire for countless generations to come.As I've mentioned previously this masterpiece of a movie didn't go by unnoticed. The impact it made culturally is hard to measure. The Godfather completely influenced and popularized mob movies, paving the way for the street level gangsters of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and Goodfellas, the suburban family crimes of The Sopranos, and the original sinners of Boardwalk Empire, to name a few. Not only did The Godfather influence mob movies but movies as a whole, the film was a stunning achievement in every category of storytelling, writing, performances, cinematography, direction and music. This film changed the way Italians were depicted in movies, it made them feel like more fully realized people and not stereotypes, this was a film made by Italians about italians. Countless quotes from this movie such as \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\", \"Keep Your Friends Close And Your Enemies Closer.\" and \"Revenge is a dish that tastes best when it is cold.\" are all commonly referred to and repeated in today's popular culture, even though the film is almost 50 years old.If for some reason you have not seen this movie, stop reading this review, turn on your tv and make sure that you have three hours of spare time. Trust me, you wont regret it. This is one of the only films that I believe that everyone should watch before they die.", "A Classical Masterpiece": "The Godfather(1972): A review One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather is one of those rare movies that get everything right, transcending limitations and setting new benchmarks. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay structured by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an American crime film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of a fictional New York crime family of Italian descent. The story primarily is centered on Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) and his transformation from a family outsider to the apparent heir to the title that is The Godfather, initially held by Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando). The beauty of the screenplay is not in its simplicity, but in subtlety. The Godfather, is that the story is played out entirely in a closed world. The audience is sucked into admiring the characters that are essentially evil. The movie portrays the Mafia, from the inside; its structure, its functioning, its virtues and imperfections included.Now coming to the performances of the lead actors - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino. Vito Corleone, as the Godfather, is the moral centre of the movie. He understands that liquor, gambling and even women are crimes that the world has a place for, but drugs is a strict NO. Marlon Brando, plays one of his more memorable characters in the suppressed, authoritative Sicilian.Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, is brilliant. As the story progresses forward, we see Michael move from a soldier in love and one who undermined his family business, to the loving son who sought to protect his family, and eventually turned into the one thing he never wanted to become. In the end, an articulately brilliant movie that captivated the audience from the start and does not let them drift, due its brilliant screenplay and acting. No wonder then that it features as one of the best movies in cinematic history.", "AFI Be Damned - This should be #1 always!": "I mean, I like Shawshank a lot, but I always thought The Godfather should be number 1 in any list of the greatest films, and lo and behold, I check back and now it is!The two greatest performances in American film, a supporting cast that is light years ahead of the leading actors of today, and on and on.  I've watched this movie on the order of 75-80 times, and every time I sink into it like a warm bath on a cold night. Anyone else anxiously awaiting the DVD release in October?Those of you that don't get it...hey, how about a remake? About time!!! Let's see, we could get that Hunky Kevin Costner for the Vito role (he's old now, right?), Jim Carrey could be that wacky guy Sonny, I think that Jennifer Love Hewitt would be PERFECT for Kay, and for Michael, how about...

Liked that how story moves as Journey of Al Pacino from hating to belonging of Mafia Family to being the Boss itself at the time.", "Nice Movies": "Nice Movies This. I liked Movie. Acrion, Drama. Crazy. I think more handsome actriss.", "This is a great movie!": "Spoiler:The film takes place in the 1940's Mafia era of New York as it follows the Corleone family and their rise to power.The movie has an award winning cast that includes Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), James Caan (Sonny Corleone), Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen), and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams\u2013 Corleone). I think the main theme of the film would be power and responsibility. We can see this throughout the film in the scenes with Michael and Vito talking in the hospital, Michael having the bosses killed off during the baptism, and finally the end of the film, when we see members of the \"family\" recognizing Michael as the new head of the family. In the beginning of the film, we see that Michael doesn't want anything to do with the organized crime side to his family. We see this when he is talking with Kay, he tells her that it's not who he is. As the film progresses, Michael slowly becomes entangled in the crime side to his family. After Vito is shot and is in the hospital, and Sonny is killed, Michael knows it's his responsibility to watch over his family. After Vito passes away we see Michael taking control and his rise to power. I think the best scene that shows this is the baptism scene. We see him sitting in the church listening to the baptism, then we cut away to the other bosses being killed off by the Corleone family. You know that Michael is the \"head\" of the family, but this is not confirmed until the final scene. As the camera pans out, you see members of the family kissing the hand of Michael, acknowledging that he is the new head \"Don\" of the family. Even though the film is about the Corleone family, the film focuses on Michael. This focus shows how he changes from a quiet soldier returning home from war, to the head of the top crime family in New York. Another movie where we see this kind of theme, would be the film Goodfellas. With Goodfellas, you see the rise to power of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he takes responsibility at the end to protect his family.I think the lighting plays a key role in the theme. Several scenes are shot with low-key lighting to bring the dramatic intensity of the scene. A great example of this would be when Michael, Sollozzo, and McCluskey are driving to the restaurant. The lighting is very low, focusing on the faces of the men. The scene shows Michael meeting on behalf of his family, taking responsibility and trying to stop the attempts on his father's life.Another technique that plays a key role would be the camera angle. A great example of this would be the subjective viewpoint at Louie's restaurant before Sollozzo and McCluskey are shot. The camera angle puts us in the conversation, showing the intensity of the situation. When Michael shoots both Sollozzo and McCluskey, it shows the power of the Corleone family and Michael taking responsibility to protect the family. As I watched The Godfather and recognized the theme, I could only sum up the move by saying that \"Power and responsibility can be a deadly combination\"", "I have no words to describe it": "I saw him 3 times and I am still not satisfied with seeing him.", "Almost Perfect Film": "This film beautifully captures all aspects of real life mobster activity, while also telling the story of one mans decent into darkness.

Now i know about 90 percent of IMDb users will say \" of course it's a great, what is there not to like about it. Well this movie does have a few flaws, not a lot but a few! But overall a fantastic piece of art. I've always wanted to create a movie that was visual as much as the godfather was or is. It really jumped Hollywood into a new era where mob movies were a thing and you could totally take risk with your story development and other things as well.

Something that we can't say about a lot of other mafia movies. There is one scene though I find not convincing enough and a bit clumsy, and that is the first scene with Johnny Fontane and the godfather at the beginning of the movie. Now, taking under consideration that Coppola was under a lot of stress during the shooting, because he was threatened to be replaced, the scene doesn't really work as it should in such a flawless masterpiece. Not only do I miss more insight in the relationship of those two men, the camerawork is lost for a minute and I feel it has been build up too much as a set-up for the Woltz scene, which is a mistake.", "Very nice for The GodFather": "Very nice for The GodFather\nI rarely give a 10.

Still - the greatest gangster tape, one of the films that turned the world cinema and left a mark on culture comparable to Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. The first time I tried to watch this film was in 2015. And I did not master it. I understood that there was a great and clever canvas in front of me, but I simply could not master it. For me, The Godfather was like a classical music concert: beautiful, but incomprehensible. But, after 5 years, having prepared, I decided to re-watch the film and now everything has changed.

No matter how many \"gangster\" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about \"family\" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen.

A lot of the violence however, seemed gratuitous. The biggest flaw, frankly, was choosing Marlon Brando to play the Don. I love this actor and have enjoyed many of his performances, but this wasn't one of them. I thought he was dreadfully over-acting and ghoulish. It was a gross caricature and how he won \"best actor\" is a mystery to me!

It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.", "What the heck!?": "I can't believe that I wasted my life on this crap.

But I didn't. I want everyone who liked this movie to like it, and please do not care about bad reviews.There are three reasons why I didn't like The Godfather.\nAt first, there were many characters, and it was not clear for me every moment if someone was good or bad. Because I couldn't recognize all characters by their name, I didn't understand all the dialogue about other people in the movie. So any time they were just talking, was a bit boring for me.Secondly, there was a moment in the movie where a man and a woman were fighting at home. Maybe it's just personal, but I really hate family-fights at home, where one of the fighters is much stronger than the other.At last, the movie is almost three hours long, and if you don't like the movie, that is way too long. I don't say I hate long movies, because I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Schindlers List and King Kong.There were also very good moments in this movie. The scene with Don Vito Corleone in the hospital when Michael Corleone visits him was quite thrilling, and the scene where (major spoiler ahead) Michael Corleone shots two people in a restaurant was also very good.I think I should just watch this movie again, when I have the time for it. Maybe the second time I like it better, because I will probably understand more of it.\"As I said in the last part of my original review I should watch the movie again. After I did that I've decided to change my the rating.After a second viewing I understood the plot better, the characters were more interesting and I saw why this movie is so beloved. The characters (especially Michael, the main character) are very interesting and the way the story is told is excellent.In my original review I stated three main reasons why I didn't like The Godfather. The first reason was that I didn't quite understand it. That of course changed after the second time I watched it, because I already knew some things from the first time I watched it.My third reason also changed. I said that if a movie is not interesting, it makes it worse when it is a long movie. But that wasn't a problem anymore because it was interesting the second time.My second reason didn't change. I still don't like family fights in movie, but this time I understood the relevance of it.I still don't think The Godfather is the best movie of all time for me. There are lots of other movies I liked better. But this movie doesn't deserve the 4 stars I previously gave it. 8 stars is a better rating.", "Classic Great Movie.": "Highly recommend movie.

Since the original camera negative no longer existed, the best possible pieces were brought together from all parts of the world, subjected to film scanning on a 4k scanner and then polished on thousands of individual images using the latest digital technology: Contrast and colors were optimized and coordinated with one another , Dirt particles removed and much more.All this and what Steven Spielberg has to do with the whole thing can be found in the article \"Rescue through film emulsion\", which is unfortunately a bit short at 19 minutes. \"When the shooting was over\" also focuses on technical processes such as editing and music. Indispensable for cineastes is \"A masterpiece that was almost none\", which addresses the difficult production conditions and the problematic situation of the filmmakers at the end of the sixties (with detailed input from George Lucas, among others).

They are a single piece and are best experienced that way.  (If you don't have the six hours to kill, at least view each movie on consecutive nights.) Having said that, this is the story of Michael Corleone, a man whose need to protect his family at all costs ultimately destroys it.  While Michael's father, Vito, often used violence as means to bring security and prosperity to his family, for him it was always \"just business\" -- nothing personal. Michael, on the other hand, proves unable to approach the dirty business of running a crime family with the same detachment. From the first murders he commits  to the last, it's always personal with Michael. Because the violence is personalized, Michael is corrupted by it in ways his father never was. I think it's about as close to Shakespearean tragedy as 20th century American culture ever came.

Just because there's not an explosion every 3 minutes doesn't make a movie boring. It makes it a drama. It's a genre that doesn't generally feature giant explosions and shoot-outs, because the conversations are where the real action is happening. If you don't like that kind of movie, you're not going to like The Godfather. I seen this movie before but I use to think its was boring but now I become a little mature and give a chance again and now I know that I was wrong about this but I just sit and watch the whole movie and it was great. I even watched part 2 and part 3. The Story is great and Acting is great too. You need to sit down and watch this movie carefully but its not for everyone. So Far its one of the best movies I seen.

Especially the young and not yet well-known Al Pacino. The director Coppola insisted that Al Pacino would play Micheal while the production company wanted someone else. The great pressure on Al Pacino to proof himself as a worthy actor is perfectly seen during the entire movie.  Its seems that Pacino has a lack of self confidence which fits the exactly the type of character he has to play. In The Godfather 3 you see an entire different Al Pacino. His qualities are already well known and thus there's no need to proof himself anymore.Also the role played by Duvall as Hagen is beautiful and is really missed in the third part.", "Worthy": "This film is very long but well worth watching. A story worth witnessing at least once. Thou fictional the Godfather is a film which captures the audiences imagination and will lead them into the verge of reality. As addictive as getting involved in conspiracy theories or the Da Vinci Code. This film could alter your life. Therefore to conclude. Againsts IMDb.com English only policy i say \"molto buon\". The Godfather is the first in a trilogy of films describing the life of Michael Corleone. Filled with an all star cast the films delivers on all aspects of filmography. Comedy, Romance, Action, Thriller etc. Admittably the comedy is limited by the ruthlessness of the Corleon families lust for power. The trilogy of films confirm that wealthy people can get away with murder, literally. Most touching about the film is the Italian mafia's resilience to touch drugs.

We learn that his youngest Michael avoids this life, as he doesn't want to be apart of it. Throughout the movie we watch as Vito falls and how Michael must follow his destiny even though he doesn't want to.

At one time I watched it endlessly, in Russian and in English, and read the book, and in general I was a real fan, which almost never happens to me.

This is the whole tragedy and drama of the Godfather: becoming a gangster, godfather father, Michael Corleone set off a chain of events that would later lead to, to put it mildly, unpleasant consequences. For him, this is separation from his family and children.", "Any classic is approved over time": "Any classic is approved over time, and the painting by Francis Ford Coppolys proves its inaccessibility in the genre every decade. Many years passed, and I postponed watching the film in order to \"mature\" for a certain objectivity.The picture was shot very qualitatively, which gave her the key to success to be relevant in the visual range among other competitors from other directors. There are not so many paintings I have seen with the legend of the past Marlon Brando, however, I am very glad that he received the golden statuette for the best male role in Coppola's film. His role is not as big in screen time as Al Pacino's, for example, but his character's monologues and dialogues can be quoted and quoted.\"The Godfather\" is not only the beginning of the famous criminal saga, it is also the beginning of a stellar time for Al Pacino, no matter how initially this actor did not fit his role, according to the producers, his fame could not pass unnoticed in modern cinema, and the actor cemented the image of a criminal figure forever.Referring to objectivity, I would call the film \"The Godfather\" a high-quality, benchmark in the genre, and I can understand the surge of criticism and perception of the film several decades ago, which attributed the tape to the rank of cult.

This type, more or less, was followed by all subsequent creators: someone, without taking a step aside ('Once Upon a Time in America' by Sergio Leone), someone rather unusually ('The Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese), someone tried move away from the image as much as possible ('Scarface' by Brian De Palma), and someone making a great number of references to him, and sometimes repeating frame by frame ('The Sopranos' by David Chase). However, all subsequent films of the gangster genre were created with an eye on the \"Godfather\" and tried to reach or even surpass its level (which, in the end, the sequel did two years later).Next up is the director. Francis Ford Coppola coped with his duties only as a genius, because despite the intimacy of the work, he managed to maintain the scale of the whole story. Plus, he is very good at taking rather unusual camera angles and playing with light (it was he who came up with the camera technique when half of the face is in the dark, thus personifying the duplicity of a person). I would also like to note the extremely detailed script written by Coppola together with Mario Puzo, the creator of the original novel The Godfather, and which tells about the confrontation between mafia families (Coppola was left without an Oscar for best director, but he took two statuettes for best film and best scenario).And finally, acting. Without further ado, she's as gorgeous as she is brilliant. Marlon Brando stands out most clearly in the role of the extremely charismatic and forever memorable Don Vito Corleone, who won an Oscar for his acting talent shown on the set (for the sake of the image, he even wore a special cap that made his jaw look more like a bulldog's jaw). No less talented Al Pacino (Don's youngest son, Michael), Robert Duvall (Don's adopted son, Tom Hagen), James Caan (Don's eldest son, Sunny), Diane Keaton (Michael's wife) and others starred with him.In conclusion, I would like to say that this picture left behind a huge legacy: two sequels and a huge number of gangster films from no less great creators, students of Coppola: Goodfellas, Casino, Scarface, Once Upon a Time in America , \"The Sopranos\", \"The Untouchables\", \"The Bronx Story\" and other works.", "Very cool movie!": "An important place in American history is occupied by a period when several thousand Sicilian immigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life in which there will be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxian Dons. Who knew at that time that this \"pile of Sicilian emigrants\" would take a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.", "My Favorite Film of All Time": "The Godfather is as close to perfection as cinema will ever get in my opinion. I seriously doubt that I will ever watch a movie I love more than this one, Marlon Brando brings his quintessential performance as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino makes Micheals transformation from honorable war hero to ruthless mafia boss haunting and real. Every other actor is perfectly cast as well but those are just the standouts. The cinematography is simply stunning, inventive and revolutionized the way people shot movies. Every single moment in this movie is iconic and the dialouge is simply amazing, the climax is haunting as well. The Godfather is a timeless tradgey of corruption, I could write a novel on it but to put it into one sentence, the reason this movie is so great is because it does not fail in any aspect: the actors , cinematography, story, dialogue, characters, are all outstanding. The Godfather is a film that delivers in every department.", "unscrupulous killer": "What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word \"cinema\". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes.Although this film has a three-act structure, all the acts are well packed with content. And so the film is watched in one breath. And most importantly, what message ... Each person has the right to decide for himself what meaning was laid down by the author. For me, the central theme of the story is the theme of the family and its importance. In three hours of screen time, the two protagonists undergo a gigantic evolution, turning into their opposites in interaction with each other. The all-powerful mafia becomes a feeble old man, and an idealistic young man becomes an unscrupulous killer.", "A brilliant film": "A brilliant film consisting essentially of a trilogy of films and which we in Russia practically saw only 20 years later in the era of relative development of the video market. The fact is that the duration of each of the three parts is more than 180 minutes, for which a standard videotape is designed, and therefore black market dealers had to \"cut\" the plot of each film in those places that seemed less significant to them! In terms of its psychological influence and acting, the film just SHOCKED me! The game of Marlon Brando and the then young Al Pacino is simply amazing! Everyone who is trying to position themselves as a lover of GOOD CINEMA is SIMPLY OBLIGED to watch this film! It's just a pity, of course, that we will never see the film on the \"wide\" screen and with the sound of \"dolby surround\"! For some reason it seems to me that many \"film critics\" on our website did NOT WATCH it at all or did not watch it completely. It is rather their misfortune, not their fault, that due to their financial situation they could not purchase video equipment (after all, in addition to even a cheap video player, an imported color TV was needed, showing in the PAL system - such a set cost at the level of new \"Lada\", and sometimes more expensive!) and super-expensive videotapes from \"distributors\" at a price of 90-100 rubles per cassette, which was a fabulous price for ordinary citizens! The \"First\" part is the strongest. We need her and the \"Second\". The \"third\" is significantly inferior to the previous ones, but this is the \"law of the genre\".", "It's just a wonderful movie": "This should be the best movie (along with the second part) of all time. An ensemble that has no weaknesses.In particular, John Casale (Fredo) and Richard Castellano (Clemenza) play surprisingly restrained. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Casale brings the restless Fredo to life, and you can see how weak Fredo is desperately trying to live up to the family's reputation, but knows that he can never become what his father wants.The story of one person's unwillingness to get involved in a dark family business and its gradual change under the influence of circumstances paints a vivid picture of this cruel period of US history.", "First Movie I remember watching": "The godfather to me is the benchmark that I use to rate all movies that I watch. Its the very first movie that I can recall watching when I was younger.No words can describe the depth and greatness of this iconic film.", "Time when America had a good films...": "The Godfather... This film is not so much about bandits, but about the life and broken destinies of people. The film is entirely filled with some drama and experiences of all the main characters!The cast is simply amazing! Who would have thought that at that time the little-known Al Pacino and Robert Duvall, and others, would create such unforgettable images (especially Al Pacino !!!), that even today, almost 40 years later, the film is very interesting and original, the real classic gangster movie, a real masterpiece of world cinema!This picture teaches and shows how a combination of circumstances can turn a good person, a war hero, into a criminal (although fair and noble to some extent, in my opinion!) This is the whole tragedy and drama of the Godfather: becoming a gangster, godfather father, Michael Corleone set off a chain of events that would later lead to, to put it mildly, unpleasant consequences. For him, this is separation from his family and children.You can also note the wonderful plot, it is the theme of this film. The plot really catches the soul and does not let go, everything is so beautifully done in this film!!! As paradoxical as it sounds, even the murders in The Godfather are filmed first-class!In general, the film is for viewing by everyone without exception, because this is a REAL MOVIE, it's just something that you can't just take and imagine!", "You need to see this movie": "The best movie ever, the story goes in an elegant way, it doesn't bore you. Also, with the best performances in the history of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando", "The film \"The Godfather\" - watched several times, because it is an amazing film, one of my favorites!": "The film \"The Godfather\" - watched several times, because it is an amazing film, one of my favorites! The film has a very good cast - Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are great, strong actors. All the actors in this film did their part brilliantly! The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius. The music in the film is wonderful, the script is excellent, the film is a masterpiece! This is a movie that everyone should watch at least once. Although the film is about the mafia, about crime, it is still based on human relationships, the lives of people who make mistakes, need help and support in difficult times, about friendship and betrayal. Although the film is long, it consists of three parts, but it looks with great interest, because there are no extra scenes in the film, every moment is interesting! A wonderful family drama, with the cruel rules of the mafia of life, and with an excellent cast! The best, successful film in the cinema about the mafia.", "Opera movie making": "What can be written that has not been written already. The Godfather is the classic, genre-defining Mafia movie in which Marlon Brando plays the titular character facing grave threats from rival families. Unsurprisingly, there's constant violence. Characters are shot and killed, often at close range in graphic scenes. Characters are strangled to death and die in car explosions. Domestic abuse is shown: A man beats his wife with a belt. In one of many iconic scenes, a movie executive wakes up covered in blood, with a decapitated horse's head in his bed. In the opening scene, a man asks Don Corleone for vengeance after two men raped and beat his daughter. The movie also has cigarette smoking, wine drinking, and brief nudity (female breasts), and characters are shown having sex, clothed but audible. There are some references made to the sexual behaviors of Sonny and Fredo. In short,this movie is an opera without the music.", "All time best!": "The Godfather is one of those timeless movies that stands as a benchmark for how to craft a true epic that can stand the test of time. Boasting a colorful host of characters, amazing plot twists within its sprawling storyline and impressive cinematography, The Godfather is a classic and easily one of the best crime films ever released. While there are slower moments here and some of the editing feels a little dated, the sheer visceral shock to each individual death and the absorbing storyline are enough to overlook this in what's otherwise a magnificent film.", "Shawshank is a False God, Bow Down to the True King!": "9.5/10Speak Softy Love.......so that we can discuss this masterpiece.A film that deserves every praise it gets and no critique.Hits every cinematic mark on its tiny screwhead. So many perfect, titular scenes in cinema cemented through this film. Vito's Introduction, Restaurant Killings, Scenes in Italy, Meeting Apollonia, 5 Family Sit-down, Renouncing Satan Montage and of course the End scene.3 hours of an Italian-American 40s Mobster Epic.Don't forget the lil detail of Oranges and their deathly significance.

I did not go in for very high expectations so I thought that after I had watched this movie my mind would be blown but it wasn't and thats really sad. This movie was really original but it doesn't and it helps this movie a lot still this movie is very overrated. I have not read the book. This movie compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy is I'm sorry to say it but a joke. It's not really worth watching it feels like what was the purpose of this movie? To see the underworld? The last 15 minutes are the best thing in this movie but you really got to ask yourself is it worth watching a movie that is 175 minutes long for 15 minutes? The actors was outstanding but so are the ones in as an example The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception or Lord of The Rings Trilogy. When I was going to see Looper I came in with the same expectations but but my mind was blewn! Looper had a purpose but The Godfather didn't. Sorry to all of you who think that your going to see the best movie ever but this is not the one, go see Lord of The Rings Trilogy there you have a masterpiece!", "Famous Movie": "Although Mario Paso is given possessory credit at the beginning, and is credited as a screenwriter at the end, no credit is given to him on-screen as author of the original novel, even though that credit is given on the poster.

But I seethe story of an innocent awakening to something that he must conclude. When Michael Corleone is in hiding in Sicily, he falls truly in love. He is very happy, when the life he is in hiding from reaches out to destroy his beloved. He sees that he can bring it to an end, and that he must do it. Even though he will have to assume a role immersed in this terrible world, and appear to do terrible things. He is a man who has seen his fate.

God father is one of the top movie in imdp. Thank you.", "The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen.": "There are many reasons that I say that The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen. For one, though it was made in the 70s, 1972 to be exact, it feels very modern. It's truly a timeless classic. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed and co-wrote the film, did an amazing job in the making of this film. The screenplay, which was co-written by Mario Puzo who also wrote the book of the same name, is the best that I have heard in any movie. Then there is the acting, which I think is not only the best ensemble of acting in a movie, but also that Marlon Brando, who in my opinion is one of the all-time greatest actors, put on the best performance in the role of Don Vito Corleone than any other actor did for any movie and any character. It is incredible to watch. There is no question why he won the Oscar for best actor, as well as the film winning for best adapted screenplay and for best picture. A must watch for any movie lover. It's \"an offer you can't refuse\".", "Masterclass Movie": "A masterclass in filmmaking. The Godfather is the best film of all time I'd argue the case that it is. This is the ultimate gangster movie.THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.", "Fascinating Drama with elegance and fever.": "One of the most captivating TV dramas of our time, especially the first and mostly the second film. I feel a similar captivating element in Tulsa King featuring Sylvester Stallone with the sharpness of tactics and strategies of quick planning to counteract, and quickly. I also love the elegance of style, the well-dressed suits. After a showdown, off to the Peninsula for dinner with maybe minor scratches, sweet too. For the God Father, the characters were very believable especially played in the early years. Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia...well, all of the characters. So rich.", "TOP 1": "Best movie ever made, by far my favorite movie.\nAll the actors put so much passion in this movie that you can feel it\nNothing mentioning the song track , AMAZING ,expecially the wedding scene.", "The final song of the 1970s": "I think it's difficult comment on the film with remorseful and self-righteous ideas now. I always don't think its useful to just watch it once or twice to understand The Godfather series.

Def Top 20.": "The reason I do not give The Godfather a 10 out of 10 is because it is not the perfect movie. And the reason why The Godfather is not the perfect movie is because it drags. The movie drags for 3 hours and I have to admit that Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a little overrated. I understand his amazing acting ability but i actually thought De Niro did a better job in Part 2. Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest performances in modern cinema. His performance ranks right up there with De Niro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, and Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption. I love the Godfather although I do understand the criticism the movie receives from people. (too long, boring at times)", "Greatest movie": "This movie is amazing, super insightful and motivating. Wonderful movie. I personally want there to be more interaction. Overall masterpiece this movie will forverbe apart of the greatest made in history of movie.", "though this film is too good for that rating": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.", "Best movie I've ever seen": "Best movie I've ever seen.

His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout.

The film is an expertly crafted exploration of the world of organized crime, showcasing the gritty realities of this violent and dangerous world while also delving into the complex relationships between the characters. The acting is top-notch, with Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone being particularly memorable. The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the story and the characters. The music, cinematography, and direction are all masterful, making \"The Godfather\" a movie that is both emotionally intense and intellectually stimulating.

The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

I watched the fourth DVD which includes the Godfather Notebook, it's how Coppola wrote the script for the movie on the exact papers of the original novel by cutting every single page of the novel and paste it in an A4 frame that will make the footnote bugger so he can write the script on each page of the original novel.

This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history. The Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime along with innovative storytelling, focused direction and astounding performances.", "One of the best movies I've seen": "I got acquainted with the human side of the criminal world in a distinctive way that sympathizes with the hero a lot, and it was confirmed that such a world has a great price that must be paid in this world as it is paid in the hereafter.", "OMG Best Ever": "I love this way of mafia for contorles everything.

I am now continuing to watch the movie to confirm that there is nothing better than it. I watched it five times and think of the sixth and seventh.

But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.

The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and \"family\". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan.

Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer.

The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.-TheElfstone.", "the film is very good": "The Godfather is the most famous and influential film in cinematic history. It follows a family as it is torn apart by power, greed, and love. From an author's point of view, it can be seen as a long-form \"mini-series\" (the three films tell three distinct stories that are bridged together by the main character). Not only do we see great acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino but also a great score by Nino Rota. The film has been adapted into two separate book-length studies, one from Director Coppola that focuses more on the historical context of the times and characters, focusing more on its political aspects, and another from Professor Wolf who argues that it is not just about the action on screen but also how every aspect of the film contributes to creating such an intense feeling as if you were there yourself with all its implications about family, loyalty, revenge and much more for which we will give our own personal commentary below.", "Amazing Film": "I watched and so Amazing Film.Maybe today no one Film can compare with this film.That is why Every one must think and share with Producers that we need film that equal with this fil.Everybody try and find topic about the new era as Avatar film and producers can make so cool Film that everyone can watch and speak about the this film.People also musk think and find topic that which is trend now in the world.

I will watch this movie with my grand grand children :) Firstly people think that it is only a gangster film but it is more than this. It includes the reality of the world, it gives details about the life! Other characters also have a good role play but main character will not be forgotten in the future i think. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.", "what's a exellent movie !": "The movie teach us how to be a real man.Cinematographer Gordon Willis earned himself the nickname \"The Prince of Darkness,\" since his sets were so underlit. \"Paramount Pictures\" executives initially thought that the footage was too dark, until persuaded otherwise by Willis and Francis Ford Coppola that it was to emphasize the shadiness of the Corleone family's dealings.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich\u00e9. His performance though was not a clich\u00e9. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly.", "The Godfather, Amazing movie": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay written by Mario Puzo and Coppola. The movie is based on Italian-American Mafia member Joseph \"Joe\" Bonanza's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name.

Michael is put under.", "Just really Amazing and worth watching": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.", "this moviehas haunted my life": "I love this movie and all of the GF movies.

His tone of voice indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. We hear neither prosecutor nor defense attorney, and learn of the evidence only second-hand, as the jurors debate it.

It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art.

Growing up as a film nut, I often heard of The Godfather as possessing a sort of mythic status that few films made after 1955 possess. I first watched it back close to ten years ago as a 12-year-old, never fully getting the story with the film falling into the \"great film that I didn't appreciate\" category until a month or so back when I got the Coppola restoration Blu-Ray and realized as an adult how fantastic of a film it truly was. The Godfather works so well because it isn't a film that kisses its ass on a variety of sub-levels. Francis Ford Coppola went out of his way not to make the film one that glorifies the Mafia in any way but still realized what a magnificent project it was. It begins in celebration and ends as the first part of the trilogy in bitter-sweet victory and tragedy for the Corleones with Michael having slowly morphed into a different character by the end and the Corleone family itself has endured tragedy after tragedy. Depending on if you're selective to certain genres of movies -- particularly crime and heist thrillers -- the 1970s were either a fantastic time with the New Hollywood group of directors or a pitiful time where the Anti-Hero was all the rage. I've always tried to keep a foot in both camps for the most part, but if a film like this doesn't make you at least sit there as the credits roll, musing in thought like Indiana Jones after being given a clue by a recently-killed shaman or anti-Nazi spy the first time you watch it, then I'm not sure you know how to appreciate films and movies as art and not just entertainment. There are so many ways this film just works so well; the first is that Coppola always had a way of making the cinematography and direction style look both extravagant, but also bleak at the same time, partially through sun-faded cinematography (I'm just guessing) and also partially through the way the film itself was shot. As well fact that Coppola spared nothing when it came to deploying talented screen stars of the day to cast The Godfather, leading Marlon Brando to find international success once more with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as the reluctant, but the eventual successor to his father Vito, Michael Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and of course, a pre-Rocky Talia Shire as Connie Corleone. These cast members in particular stand out in their performances and convey a sort of detached emotion that makes the film so great (if you need clarification on this, the scene where Vito overlooks his own son's body in the morgue is a prime example). Although it is the best install installment Godfather trilogy, the film itself suffers from a few key points that I've never been able to reason out why were included. Specifically, the whole sequence involves Johnny Fontaine and the Woltz horse fiasco which has no real involvement in the over-arcing storyline. However, with how spectacular of a film it is, I'm not going to sit here and complain about it any further.", "Greatest movie in the world": "I love this, I love this movie and all of the GF movies.

He wants to break away from the criminal underworld and start a legitimate business, but his ambition and pride put him at odds with his father and his criminal associates.The story of The Godfather is both complex and compelling, and the performances are top-notch.

Coppola places us instantly withinside the smack-dab middle of what is, admittedly, a society made via way of means of criminals for criminals. It is likewise the cause why it is so welcoming. We are surrounded via way of means of its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, guys who see crime like a nine to five process masquerading as honorable guys. And I do suggest guys. From the outside, we might simplest witness the horrifying, demanding manifestations in their properly-concept out actions.But it is going even deeper than that. It all revolves across the Corleone own circle of relatives led via way of means of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the maximum sincere of those guys, sitting proper at the edge. But for humans like him, who do now no longer absolutely embody this global, it is now no longer easy. He avoids battle till it's miles definitely necessary. He is a person described via way of means of ethical principles. There is a scene on the beginning, wherein, at some point of his daughter's wedding ceremony day, one in every of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he goes to present to the Don whilst he meets him. The scene with those is humorous and nearly adorable. I couldn't assist however sympathize each of them simplest to understand that I am feeling warm temperature for 2 mobsters. Not to even point out that Lenny Montana became an real mob hit-guy and that he became certainly worried as he stated that line.The extra I watched the extra I found out simply how enormously complicated and ruthless this society is and the way it has the electricity to deprave absolutely everyone to are available in touch with it. The excellent instance is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns domestic for his sister's wedding ceremony as a strugglefare hero dressed the element together along with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, however necessity, first-hand publicity and simply its sheer devilish attractive nature attracts him in. As we get in addition withinside the movie, the alternate is stunning and each outsider who ever were given near him is tainted in a single manner or another. If they live on it, they may be drawn in in addition to we're as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the own circle of relatives to us absolutely, with a ambitious non-public technique and we witness each discussion, each methodically calculated desire. Crime is achieved truly due to the fact it's miles the character in their business, and we're placed on a chair along them, so we effortlessly relate. For us, they may be the coolest men, the rival households are the horrific men. This is the best feat this movie controlled to tug off--set aside properly men and horrific men in a global packed with horrific men.This is a movie of unequalled subtlety. No different film sustains itself as properly. No different movie is achieved with such precision, interest and completeness. There are many layers which I likely ignored and perhaps will in no way notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his associate in crime (terrible desire of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is not anything quick of a undying piece of reference cinema whose affect isn't primarily based totally on reinventing the wheel, however as an alternative perfecting it to absolutely the maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for his or her historic contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" added the most important step-as much as the artwork form, the equal matters did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few movies so that it will be remembered truly due to the fact they may be that properly and I can not probable consider a extra achievement.", "The Godfather so well.

Obviously they didn't and conspired to have him killed. Anyone, including the Godfather's enemies knew of Luca Brasso's absolute devotion to the Godfather and would have laughed and never believed such an amateurish ruse, that the Godfather's most loyal enforcer has suddenly become a turncoat. 2-: Why should Sollozzo assume that by killing the Godfather he can make a deal with his temperamental son, Sonny? And with a son of a Sicilian mafia family at that!! 3-: Why, at the midst of the war between the Godfather's family and other new York mafia families, when every member of the Godfather's family, for their protection, is brought into the family compound where the family is residing, Constance, the Godfather's daughter (who was pregnant at the time) and her husband (an active member of the mafia side of the family) were allowed to live elsewhere (seemingly at a far away location and apparently in an adjoining state) which would have clearly placed them in harm's way and in extreme danger (at the midst of a war being raged against the Godfather's family)?

You would think a 8 or 9 year kid at the time would find the movie long or boring, but quite the opposite, when it had an intermission at the 2 hour mark we was like wow 2 hours has passed!! This is a movie best not watched on TV where there is commercials to interrupt because TV tends to make one's attention span short due to the enormity of other programming to watch.I remember watching it on TV years later and thinking to myself i can see how someone just seeing it for the first time would find it long and boring. The reason being is because if you do not tune on it from the beginning it is not the type of movie that will catch your attention compared to the action adventure blockbuster movies people are use to seeing. For a movie to keep a couple of 8 or 9 year old kids interested for 4 hours it had to done something right.I am not a movie critic so i don't feel comfortable rating it but to this day it is one of the few movies i can clearly recall almost every scene as compared to other movies where i just have a vague recollection of what they were about and what happened when and where.One reason i think i enjoyed it so much as a kid was because the story was interesting. A mafia kingpin trying to survive gang-wars and treachery.He realizes it is not good profession or lifestyle to have so he tried to steer his son Michael into a peaceful legitimate respectable profession. He tries to explain to Michael the reasons he turned to this lifestyle is because he didn't have access to the educational opportunities Michael had access to. With a wife and many children to feed and jobs very scarce he had to do what was necessary so his family could eat and survive. He knew that Sonny's temperament would not allow Sonny to change course from the family's profession and Fredo so much a nincompoop that Fredo could not have too much responsibility or pressure thrust on him and would need someone to look after him so he kinda was treated like the women of the family. But he saw in Michael intelligence and ability, and he wanted Michael to use his talents legitimately and achieve the American Dream. Sorta what every father wishes for their sons. I think the turning point for Michael from turning from the American Dream was when the police under McCluskey instead of normally taking a neutral role in the war between the gangs took an active role in protecting Sollozo and trying to rid Don Vito of any bodyguards at the Hospital so the allied Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia camp could finish Don Vito off. When Michael was roughed up by McCluskey and the police he began to see the American Dream as a big corrupt hypocrisy and that money and the access to money was the only thing that really mattered in America. Recall the speech he gave to Mary Kay when he told her she was the one who was really naive not him ( It may have been in The Godfather part 2).From that point on Michael began see the irony and erroneous assertions of what his dad was saying that politicians and police would desert him if he would began to expand into narcotics but the exact opposite was happening with the opposing Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia faction as their Consigliere Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall) predicted. Sollozo was virtually untouchable because he had Police protection because of the wealth he accumulated from his narcotic operations.As a result Michael lost all his idealism and became a pragmatist. Why try to become legitimate and respectable when no one really is and the so called legitimate and respectable people behind closed doors sell out to the highest bidders regardless whether or not if they are ruthless killers, murderers and worst scum of society.You can transform into being respectable and legit once you accumulate your wealth. Notice the talk by Michael near the end that they are moving the operations to Las Vegas and going Legit.", "The Best Movie In The World": "This film is the best movie in the world and it is wonderful and beautiful story and absolutely is one of the best act from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.

Trust me and see this movie.", "top notch flick": "This is an oldie but a good. I can watch this movie over and over without getting bored. If you want some up beat watch your back style movie then don't hesitate in watching this flick. Overall I give it a 9 out of a 10 simply because I usually never give any movie a perfect score.

From the opening frames to the final scene, one cannot help but be mesmerized with the intriguing and fascinating story of Don Vito and his family.  This is a picture of epic proprtions which features outstanding performances by veteran actors Brando, Caan, Duvall and Hayden; and equally spellbinding performances by relatively newcomers Pacino, Shire, and Keaton.  This is one of those rare movies where seeing it once, twice, or even three times is really not nearly enough to fully enjoy the greatness of this cinematic event.  This may not be the greatest movie ever made, but if it isn't, it certainly is one of the top five.  A definite must see!", "One of the Best Movies": "It's really a good movie that makes you interact with the Events.", "simply, the best": "Simply put, The Godfather is the best film ever made.  From story, to direction, to screenplay, to acting, to sound and music, to editing, and in particular, to the overall importance of cinema as a medium, there is no equal to The Godfather.  Only this brief paragraph is needed to voice my comments on this film; many others in and out of the movie critic circle have already written volumes on the subject.One little parting note... A good piece of advice I always give to my friends and family whenever I hear them lamenting and complaining about poor films they have recently seen:  \"whenever you start to feel that movies are not measuring up anymore, that no one is making a movie that means anything, that Hollywood is out of touch, etc., go home and watch The Godfather again. The experience will remind you of what movies, when at their absolute best, are capable of achieving.\"", "Mario Puzo taking rebirth in every frame.": "Masterpiece of all time! Mario Puzo taking rebirth in every frame.", "#1 movie?": "I don't understand what is so special about this movie.Its long,boring,and drawn out.I love Al Pacino but i seriously doubt this launched his career.There has been much greater mob movies made that surpass this one entirely.I seen it thinking WOW all these great actors it must be great as everyone is saying,but i found it dull and could barely stay awake!My score 2/10.", "A film which defines what cinema should be": "Many people who watch this film now describe it as boring, drawn out and a great let down. However this is often simply because modern cinema goers expect, lightning fast car chases, huge explosions and enough special effects to make your eyes bleed.This film is not about any of those modern cinema traits, the acting powers through the 3 hours of mafia heaven. A power house of actors such as Brando and Pacino make this easily one of my favourite movies of all time, the film centres itself on Michaels slow demise from a war veteran who is honest and hard working, with no interest in his families business, into a dark man who shows no remorse for his enemies of business. From this central film there are sub plots throughout which truly engulf you in the world of the Italian families.Every time I watch this film it gets better, certain characters stand out more, and just because it does not have a ginger bread path leading you through a nice straight forward single plot, does not make it a boring film.As any true cinema fan will tell you this is a power house film which showcases what cinema has to truly got to offer.", "Misunderstood by many.... But one of the greatest films ever": "a lot people her bash this movie as being boring.I read their comments and it seems they only like the violent parts cause that's all they could remember. But really the story is about how Mike,a normally nice guy(college boy,apple of his daddies eye)becomes a cold hearted monster this is the tragedy of this story( which is it's greatest asset)I was very engaged by all the characters I even know names and lines of the movie. As a kid I didn't understand it and couldn't watch it and I loved gangster movies. But as I got older I finally understood the movie. The violence only makes the point of Mike's turn even stronger as he shows no remorse for what he has done. In the beginning of the movie he tells Kay the story of Johnny Fontane's contract. But he basically tells her that's how my family operates,not me. Then as the film pushes on he becomes worse then his father ever was because he kills with no remorse and does only what his mind tells him instead of listening to his heart sometimes( classic struggle). In my opinion this is one of the greatest films ever!!!!!!", "i am disappointed with The Godfather": "I watched this movie recently, and i am disappointed. I was expecting masterpiece, i was wrong. It is on the top, but i think it is highly overrated. The Godfather is definitely too long, some parts are absurd, like final scene when Mike tells his wife that he didn't kill his brother-in-law, and she believes him!!!!!! I was laughing and this is not a comedy. Music is bad, too many useless scenes. The Godfather is a good movie, but not brilliant, as many think. There are many better movies like: The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Lord of the Rings(1,2,3), Fight Club, etc. When you like crime movies so better watch: Goodfellas, LA Confidential, Once Upon a Time in America.Still i must admit Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!Worth seeing 6/10, not a masterpiece.", "No words, just admire": "Since 1972 lots of words have been said. I think that there are just 2 options: -or you let me write nineteen full books about that, -or you better watch it, even if you think it is not your kind of film. Just watch it. It's really the top. Just a little of it i can say, just like a mirror. It is the top about Marlon Brando working. Even better than his acting in Apocalypse now or...anything else... You can understand it above all in the interview released in the post production period. Some of the particulars which made his character such complete, have been just an intuition of Marlon Brando or Francis Ford Coppola. This thing has been taken like an example for all the cast and... that's the result.", "A very nice work.": "I wouldn't believe it if someone else told me that this movie would be so special. One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Flawless acting, editing, music... It is even more binding as it is a film series.", "Cult!": "The Godfather trilogy is probably the best movie series about underground mafias and families. Each part challenges the other by doing so,The Godfather Trilogy became the classics that will last till the end of the World.It makes you feel scared, brave, romantic, and sometimes cruel. Watching it reminds you the value of your life and how it is not valued sometimes when the matter is your honor. I believe there won't be any other film that can ever again tell the story of underworld and its rules.Thank you Francis Ford Coppola", "Why this is a great movie": "1. The acting. Every performance in this film is believable. You forget they are acting and really believe they are the characters. 2. The pace. Not too slow, not too fast, just right. 3. The music. Perfect! 4. Character introduction, character development. All the major characters are introduced in a way, and then you see how they change. 5. The details, sounds, etc. You really get the sense of the decade they are in. The phones, cars, restaurants etc all feel authentic. 6. There is a love story, but too mushy, and it does not detract from the film. 7. There is some comedy, but in small subtle doses, and does not take away the serious of the film. 8. Suspense and surprises. 9. the most memorable opening scene of all time, arguably. 10. The impact on pop culture. Scenes, lines, etc. That are now part of our every day vocabulary.", "Great Movie, worthy of its reputation": "In general, this film portrays the institution that is the crime family. The family is powerful because it is connected, intimidating and brutal. Either you are a friend of the family, or an enemy of the family. If you are a friend of the family, then you are subjugated by the family--you owe the family for being your friend. If you are an enemy of the family, then you are first threatened,and if you are still recalcitrant, then you are killed. (Evidently, the family operates in much the same way as the Roman Empire operated in its hey day.) Respecting everyone with whom you are involved and playing by the rules of the game are necessary virtues during times of peace and breaking them is a virtue during times of war. Because the aesthetic of this crime world is understandable to the viewer, the brutality that permeates it is palatable to the viewer.As the seminal work of a genre that is now well developed, the movie still stands out, head and shoulders, both over all other movies in the crime-family genre and over most movies in any genre, period.  What makes it so poignant is how it shows the chance transformation of university-educated war hero, into the head of the crime family. The viewer has high expectations for such a promising young man, for him to maybe become a lawyer, a businessman... to become anything but the leader of such an inhumane institution. But by circumstance or fate, he is forced to overcome a gauntlet of dangers and difficulties just to survive. And by surviving them, he becomes the don. But the transformation does not take obvious steps. The viewer does not realize what he, the university graduate, is becoming until the last scene when the viewer realizes what he has become--a reincarnation of his father, a don. Because every scene in the movie is gripping, we have a tendency to lose sight of the big picture.  When we finally see that the war hero has become a don, we are compelled to reflect on his life, to see how his experience informed his choices and his actions, to see what got him to where he is, in the same way that we are, ever now and then, forced to reflect on our own decisions in life. 5/5", "THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME": "This is the best movie of all time. It has everything a good movie should have. Nobody can not enjoy this movie if they are decently intelligent. It is THE BEST DRAMA/CRIME MOVIE of all time, for sure, and it is my favorite movie of all time. It is Marlon Brando at his best. When people think of Brando, they usually first think of the Godfather. If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT!! You are missing out on an excellent piece of film history. There will never be a drama film more powerful than the Godfather.", "Ashley Aonyea Says...": "Well... if I had to choose the ultimate Gangsta movie to review this tops the list! Action..Crime..Suspense to name a few are all included in this flick, and it does not disappoint. This is your go-to movie when you want to feel like the ultimate CRIME BOSS (minus the jail time)Definitely one of Francis Ford Coppola best films. He really captures the essence of the lifestyle these Good fellas have. In retrospect he breathes life into the characters that already hold enough personality for an entire football team. If I had to rate it between one and ten I would say a seven, only because the movie is so damn dark you feel like the director shot the entire flick at night!", "The best movie, ever": "A true classic. I love the Godfather trilogy. It's #1 on my list and it will stay that way. Al Pacino is so incredible in this movie. I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Michael Corleone as Pacino did. He is such an intense actor...the best actor in my opinion.", "Precisely why I feel this is the greatest movie of all time": "I honestly think this is the finest piece of cinema I have every viewed (but then again, I can't claim to have seen vast quantities of movies). Firstly, the aesthetics mark it out as a classic: some shots, such as those of Vito Corleone in his study, could be removed from the film and considered art by themselves. Not only are the costumes beautiful, the lighting, sets and movement makes the film absolutely stunning, visually. All scenes appear to have a mild sepia tint and the lights particularly focus our eyes on peoples' expressions.Of course a film cannot survive on aesthetic beauty alone: the subtlety in the acting is superb. Al Pacino's face fleshes out his character perfectly and the mannerisms and prescence of each character is distinct and revealing. Although it is occasionally difficult to understand Marlon Brando, his screen prescence is astonishing and he, as the head of the family, he dominates his scenes. Yet there is something in Michael Corleone that singles him out, and Al Pacino really brings this to the role.I am less interested in the film's social commentary, although it is present and strong. The film has a distinctly 'epic' feel to it and as a result seems relatively objective. It does an astonishing job of presenting the characters as human beings and brothers and fathers and friends. In most films, the same characters would be painted by the film as either violent thugs or murderers. Of course, the director does not insult our intelligence, and this is what makes the film so good: Michael Corleone is a murderer and a thug, and the film does not hide this; yet we identify with him and we understand his motives and his mind. By the end of the film he is cold-blooded, a killer and has his brother-in-law murdered. Yet we look at him as a member of a family, not as a Mafia Don. He is one of the finest characters in movie history.", "!": "I read the book written by Mario Puzo 10 years ago. The book is one of my favourits. Francis Ford Coppola and his crew has succesfully imagined the story to an outstanding movie. It took me ten years to realize that i was ready to see it. I can't wait ten years too see part two...", "Undeniable classic": "This is great filmmaking.  I've seen this film countless times, and it still takes my breath away.  There is not a single false step in the casting or the performances, and the movie has a lot to say about power, corruption, family, pride and America.  As I write this the sprawling and excellent Lord of the Rings trilogy is getting a lot of ink for its multiple layers of Meaning, but of course that is a fable.  The Godfather seems as real as can be.", "My all-time favourite": "Unmissable! Great cinema, great performances, from a great director.\nA must see", "Legendary!!!": "Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place!!!", "A father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes.": "In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of it's own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Let's get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, let's think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this film's score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous 'The Godfather Waltz', Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get it's award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made.", "THE GODFATHER is perfect. Unbelievable performances. Outstanding direction. Strong dialog. Beautiful music.": "The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. It's perfect, or at least close to perfection. It is obviously overrated, but there's a reason it's like that.The Godfather is perfect in many ways. First of, the acting. This is one of a few films in which brings amazing performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is obviously solid gold. The then 47-year-old nails it as the title character and offers an iconic, unforgettable performance that will always remain one of the strongest performances in movie history. Al Pacino succeeds as the \"nice college boy\" that changes strongly throughout the film. James Caan and Robert Duvall come strong as supporting characters, as well as Richard Castellano, Al Lettieri and Diane Keaton.Francis Ford Coppola is one of the last great directors. His directing in The Godfather is brilliant and spectacular. The screenplay for the film is terrific. Many good and iconic lines, and great dialog. The music is beautiful. The main theme is bone chilling and the Love Theme is unique and a masterpiece. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the wedding party to Sicily, Italy, it's just breathtaking.No matter how many years pass, I know for sure that The Godfather will always remain a strong and powerful film, and one of the most important films in motion picture history.

I wouldn't recommend to allow your kids to watch but I have to admit is simply amazing.", "Fantastic, but not the best.": "The Godfather is possibly one of the best constructed films I have ever seen: the lighting and colouring are perfect, giving every frame an almost painting like quality; the camera work is brilliantly modest; and the film hosts some of the greatest acting ever committed to celluloid.However, there is something about the film which stops me from becoming as emotionally involved as I feel I could have been. Maybe its just the story itself, which I personally cannot connect to. It feels cold, but I'm sure that's the intention.So, definitely one of the greatest films ever made, however I cannot agree with other posts claiming it is a better film than Citizen Kane.", "The Lessons are Great": "I didnt see The Godfather trilogy until very recently. I heard about it's greatness from everywhere, so I decided to take  look at them. By far, I thought that The Godfather was a great movie, because not only is it a great Mafia/Cosa Nostra movie, it subtly throws in messages of the importance of family and respect. That is why I think this movie is a ten. The Godfather will stand the test of time, and it will be a movie I want my kids to see (when theyre a little older of course).", "this is brilliant and takes its place as one of the best films of all time": "The Godfather is a 1972 American gangster-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay by Puzo, Coppola, and Robert Towne (uncredited).[3] It stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton, and features John Cazale, Talia Shire, Al Martino, and Abe Vigoda. The story spans ten years from 1945 to 1955 and chronicles the fictional Italian American Corleone crime family. Two sequels followed: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990.The Godfather received Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay, and has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

How Michael goes from being the war hero non- criminal, to become the leader of the biggest crime family is just amazing. But the best thing about the movie is Marlon Brando's performance. Just astonishing and it will be remembered as one of the greatest acting performances in film. I love how the conflicts build up during the movie, and that they can not trust anyone except their own family. If you love mob and crime movies, this is one for you. The music is also terrific, it fits the scenes perfectly. It is a great directed movie by Francis Ford Coppola and he keeps up the impressing work in The Godfather Part 2.

In the first scene you can realize how Coppola was super careful in details of the movie the typical big wedding in a Italian shape same being in USA, the songs and way people dance and get connected you feel like watching not a move but a oracle crystal ball where you can see everything happening rich of details and feelings.", "Love This Movie": "If you can embody the power of \"The Godfather\" you can do anything!", "Nr.1 till now and in the next 100 years": "A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of \"family\" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.MMR Top 150 banner Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled \"box-office poison\". And third, it points to Brando's influence as \"godfather\" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance.", "One of teh best movies ever": "Great move as previous and next part.

Trust me...", "Film maker": "The best movie, the best actor, the best director and the best writer !!!", "Absolute Masterpiece": "Not many movies can be called \"The Perfect Movie\". However, in my humble opinion, The Godfather can be called as such. Everything about this movie (again, in my opinion, all of this) was spectacular.Marlon Brando is simply unforgettable as Don Vito Corleone, who has become an icon among organized crime itself. Al Pacino makes his breakthrough performance in this movie as Michael Corleone, who just wants to live his own life outside of his family's lifestyle. James Caan plays the hostile, hot-headed Sonny Corleone in a way that can only be described as if he were living the role. I could sit here and describe every single role in this movie, but that would take much more than 1,000 words.The music and lighting set a dark yet warming tone to the otherwise gritty setting here. Along with the winding story which makes the 3 hours this film occupies swing by quickly and leave you wanting more.A classic movie indeed, if you haven't seen it yet, highly recommend it.10/10", "Strange, very strange and such sad that...": "Today, i have finished watching Godfather 3. After the film, i looked for whom vito carlione was at IMDb so to find out what other films he starred at; yet i saw, it's writing (1924-2004). Eventually, i got very sad. Firsly, i supposed the Godfather film as it is real: so much money property fame murder desire pride, on the other hand see that it's now 2010, and he died in 2004. So there is no sensible relation with the environment, world that i dreamed. He is at the moment accounting for his life, actions which were in this life, this is so much sorrowful that not my eyes but my heart is crying, suffering. How much have i been deceived, made mistake throughout my life. In my mind were some wishes going about, like i wish michael carlione wouldn't have killed his elder brother, at last he himself like his father died on a chair all alone inspite of the trasure, proerty, money, fame. It is so sad inspite of being just a film. I'm not sure if al pacino lives, even he -took a deep breath for sad- Alas me too have died one day all alone, and now i'm asked to account for my life, my actions, my desires. However, i have deceived myself in this deceiving world, shut the sound that tells the truth, the right thing. I have always pursued something seemingly nice but in fact harmful,deceiving as now.As it were, i was the servant, -that is a bit indignity-the dog of this bad sound. Alaaas... Alaaas. What will it help if i were a godfather like don vito carlione or michael. At last, the suffering, very suffering but with the witness of thousands of deads everyday the death, the reckoning after death. I think i have no remedy other than seek forgiveness and help from God, really no remedy else. I always remember the scene that michael was falling and dying on his chair alone, and the sad film music is playing in my mind. Very sad... What remedy else could i have that, now it is really the most important need if anyone has a remedy...", "Among the best films ever made": "This is mostly in response to some of the bad reviews I've read on this on the site. It absolutely contains spoilers. If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and then please come back and read this, especially if you didn't like the movie.While it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is certainly my personal favorite and is up there among the best with movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca. One of the main criticisms I saw of this film was that it was too long. This is pathetic. 3 hours, in the great scheme of things, is really not that long. If you really want to give the film a chance, you can manage keeping your eyes open for that long. That being said, its length is necessary to manage the progression of the story. Think about it: there is not one scene that can be removed from the film and have it keep its composure.This leads me to the second main criticism, that it is too long-winded, and as some people say, has no plot at all. This is simply false. The main crux of the story, for those who refused to look for it, is the development of Michael from a puppy-eyed guy who had a swell gal and hated his father's business to a cold-hearted, truly evil character who oversees half of the film's deaths in a matter of 20 minutes, movie time. Some claim that this transformation is not called for, and that it seems too sudden, but there is really a cause and effect. McCluskey punches him, he gets mad, realizes that he should kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, goes to Italy, comes back heartbroken after the murders of Appollonia and Sonny, and finally snaps when Vito passes. Of course, this leads to his rise as Don Corleone, giving him the power to execute Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, Zaluchi, and Moe Greene. It's actually very well thought out.Then people say \"Why wasn't Vito like this?\" The reason why Vito is such an interesting character is that he is not like his counterparts in the other families. Pay close attention to the film and you will note that he never orders the death of anyone. The closest he comes is in the very beginning when he takes Bonasera's request, but he specifically states that the two men who beat his daughter are to suffer, but not to die, because it is not \"just.\" Perhaps equally as close is the warning to Michael that someone (Tessio) will betray him to Barzini. He never says to kill the person, it was basically just a heads-up. He clearly regrets that Bruno Tattaglia was killed, and especially that Sollozzo and McCluskey were killed by Michael. It is Vito's near-pacifism that exaggerates the ultimate development of Michael. Indeed, Michael waited for Vito's death to kill Carlo; Vito would have never approved of that. A second facet of this is his refusal to participate in narcotics. He says to Sollozzo it's merely for political reasons, and understandably so. But Vito is a moral man, and at this stage of his life, he sees the evil of his ways. I have yet to see The Godfather Part II, but it would not surprise me if Vito had some sort of epiphany in the course of the plot that led him to see his error. And if you can't understand him, you're not trying hard enough. Watch it twice if you have to.People also rant about the lack of violence in the film, but this is ridiculous. If it were advertised as an action film, then I could see the point. But that is not the case. And in addition, when shooting comes, like in the baptism scene, you can't ask for much more in 1972 than what you see there.Finally, the film is criticized for alleged glorification of the mafia business. I will admit that this is romanticized, but neither Mario Puzo nor Francis Ford Coppola sets out to create accuracy. In addition, people haven't really had a problem with more recent films like The Town, which gave back stories to bank robbers. In fact, Jon Hamm's cop character was easily the least likable character in that film, though the world usually perceives him as the good guy. For older movies, look to Best Picture winner All Quiet on the Western Front, from the perspective of Germans in World War I. Just because it's from the perspective of the \"bad\" side doesn't mean it's glorifying them.Okay, my rant is over. I've pretty much covered not only why criticisms fail, but also why this movie stands as one of the greatest of all time. The only criticism I may have of this film is Connie's reaction to Carlo's death. Carlo was very abusive to her, and she was clearly unhappy in her marriage, but she is extremely distraught and calls Michael a \"bastard\" after hearing of Carlo's death. It seems inconsistent, but it's not nearly enough to outweigh the final few seconds of the film, let alone everything else that makes The Godfather the classic it is.", "The most beatiful movie": "If you watch this movie , you will see the real world.\nThe real world is not like you think... the real world 99% you can see it , and learn from this movie...

I mean, Al Pacino's nomination was for Best Supporting Actor... give me a break. Honestly, I don't see how this masterpiece din't take home at least 10 golden statuettes. It took so much guts and fight from Ruddy and Coppola to deliver what we see on screen. As filmmakers and cinema lovers, we are all indebted to the filmmakers, cast, and crew for pulling resources, putting up with threats of being fired, and ultimately giving it all for this movie to come together. I must have seen it 50 times in its 50 years since the release and it's a treat to my senses every time.", "Excellent...": "I love this movie and all of the GF movies.

Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is possibly the greatest film ever made.  Simply riveting from beginning to end.

This is one movie I don't get tired of watching. Whether it is the acting, the story, or the dialogue, The Godfather delivers. Brando is the quintessential mafioso, and Pacino is convincing as the \"black sheep\" of the family who comes to realize his true calling when his family needs him most. His transformation is well told - it does not come as a surprise; it does not seem contrived. The supporting cast is solid as well. I couldn't recommend it more highly.", "Greatest Movie of All time": "Very few films of today can compete with The Godfather (1972). This is a must see for all movie buffs, and chances are you've already seen or heard about it. Marlon Brando gives an outstanding Oscar worthy performance, which earned him an Oscar to which he \"refused.\" Al Pacino stars and gives stellar acting toward the film, and in my opinion this catapulted his movie career into stardom. Francis Ford Coppola directs phenomenally, and the film is as close to realism as you can get. Everything is tops from: the screenplay, the acting, cinematography, etc. You will not be disappointed; this film will forever stand the test of time.", "What a classic": "That was a classic, this is what you'll hear about this movie. The Godfather has set the stage since it's release in 1972, for all other movies in it's class. All \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have won as many awards. The difference between this movie and the rest is that this film apart has the ability to weave the often-many layers of story into a firm whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, reinforced by so many complimentary themes, each is given added ring. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion. Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. It is obvious that this motion picture was not put together just for the fun of it, to make people laugh; it was carefully crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie. The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a Second World War hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their \"adopted\" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man. With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are old fashion. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him. Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be devour by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by betrayed from both within and without. The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from \"innocent\" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was. Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \"throne\", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son). Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries. Motifs Return to Sicily Michael, Connie, and Kay, all principle characters, are in all three movies, while secondary characters like Archbishop Gliday or Senator Geary appear in only a single film. Of course, such a structure makes sense. The plot follows the most significant characters, while the less significant die or are forgotten. But every rule has its exceptions. In the Godfather trilogy, one such exception is the insignificant, little-known Don Tommasino. Tommasino appears in every movie because he is Vito's and Michael's host and friend in Sicily, the island of Vito's birth to which characters return in every film. In the Godfather films, Don Tommasino may be a minor character, but Sicily is not. Sicily seems to be the mystical place, but in reality, it is a world full of violence and bloodshed. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are all ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word \"Mafia\" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.", "Absolutely amazing! The greatest movie I've ever seen...": "I can say that this isn't just good movie, it's amazing, it's not just one of the best, it's the best movie I've ever seen. What an idea, what a music, what a brave of characters in this movie. I read book of Mario Puzo a year ago, all the movies in this trilogy I had seen for 3-4 years. Book is also great, but I definitely like movie much. Sometimes I compare it to \"Once upon a time in America\", there is such an idea I think, but greater is Godfather I mean. 10 stars out 10. I didn't give such a point to any movie... Still the best however I have seen about 100-150 movies. I don't think something will change for me in future so Godfather will be the greatest one for me.", "Very Good!!": "This movie is the best I've seen. Very Good!!!Perfect!!!I also saw the God father II&III, but I think I is the best , the I story also the best!Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed the Godfather films, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release as The Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years later The Godfather, Part II balanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?) The Godfather, Part III was mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid", "Great Movie, but highly overrated !": "I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but you've already knew it deep inside of you.

Today most of what you see in the cinemas is filled with special effects but the plot sucks big time.

Hands down it is a prefect movie in every shape of the word. The moment i began watching this movie it took me in, i'm not Italian but felt proud to be a Latin American after watching this because of the amount of pride and value the writer gave to these characters, the love of family is one that i can relate to being from a Hispanic family. Many similarities in the way we conduct our lives. Building up the Godfather, with the dramatic lighting, long cuts, the sense of realism as if you were there at the wedding says so much about the director. The roll of the god father must have been a hard roll to fill and execute, but Marlon Brando murdered it. He is nothing like any of his movies in the past. The embodiment of this character is one to remember. Hollywood needs more movies like this to be released in 2016 and 2017.

This film is about the Corleone crime family and centers around Michael Corleone, son of the head of the family Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting is beyond perfect to the point where I can even say it is the best male acting performance. Watching his character going from kind-hearted and generous to a cold pathological liar made me feel everything that the characters felt. The most amazing part is the chilling ending when Michael is confronted by his sister, who claims he killed her husband. After she is taken out of the room, Michael's wife Kay talks to him about this and tearfully asks if he did murder his sister's husband. Michael denies everything, and Kay believes him. When she leaves the room, she spots her husband in a regal position being treated like an emperor by three people who have just entered his office.

This movie shows the revenge, greed, and betrayal, between the Corleones and the mafia. Marlon Brando does a superb job playing the godfather who is the leader of the mafia, or Vito as they call him. His character gives one insight to what the mafia really is about and the business deals among them. Other actors such as Al Pacino and James Caan also portray their characters Michael and Sonny as the sons of the godfather very well too. Michael at the beginning of the movie has no interest in being involved in the mafia and by the end he has taken over the family business. People get to see first hand the transformation of these characters from beginning to the end of the movie. The story line makes this movie much more fascinating yet harder to follow than your average movie. Each scene that takes place in the movie is essential to understanding and delving in even deeper into the history of the Corleones and their involvement with the mafia. The great acting, excellent dialogue, and an ever-changing plot is what sets this movie apart from the rest. I recommend this movie to any movie fanatic.

I liked the way Coppola directed it,as a lengthy movie i never get bored. I also watched THE GODFATHER part2, also a great movie and THE GODFATHER part3,which was not so bad as many says. Undoubtedly THE GODFATHER part1 is my best movie and i will never stop watching it.", "Family power": "This is the drama about an Italian family with a serious influence to the society and contributed a large part to the crime wave in the 1930's. The movie also talk about the family value and how they stick together in any situation Don Vito Corleone, head of the family, who had build up his own mob empire. He dealt in pretty much anything,from drug to robberies. He had some serious pull in the US government. Politicians eat out of his hand like birds. He was one of the most powerful men at that time until he got shot by one of his rivals. Thats when Michael, his son, comes into play.Michael Corleone, Vito's youngest son, World War I hero, after the military, he went home to stay with the family. After his father got shot, he took the liberty to protect the family service by killing a corrupted cops along with his partner who happens to be Vito's rival and shooter. Michael did just that and he had to move out of the country for a while until the heat is off of him.

Starting from the actor .. moving to the team and technical they used that time. It is amazing and unbelievable they did such a beauty.The story is moving smoothly, the body is building the main point continuously. Music also a PLUS point in the film.", "The best or nothing": "Iconic movie no one can't miss it name or forget it.", "Best gengster movie": "The best gengster films of all time.\n-great characters\n-good atmosfera\n-exciting story", "Film Form Review": "This movie was impeccable. It showed great cinematography, and the acting was superb. The suspense was carried throughout the film with heart beating, wrenching music that matched beautifully with the scene's setting. The character of Don Corleone makes the audience feel less than him due to his superiority he portrays in the film. I highly recommend this movie to everybody, even if you do not enjoy mafia movies. The reason why it did not receive a 10 is due to the duration of the film's storyline. I just felt it ran a little too slow for my taste, but besides that, it is an amazing film comprised with outstanding performances in all film aspects.", "Best gangster movie": "An amazing drama. This kind of movies are made once every 100 years. An absolute masterpiece.", "Didnt Seem Like a Movie. Best Ever?": "I have to admit, I didnt like this movie at first. At first was when i was about 15 or 16 and didnt really pay attention to any of the dialogue and just waited for something to happen.Some time later, when I actually payed attention to the dialogue, and reading the book after, I realized this was the greatest movie ever made, without a doubt. This of course poses questions for debate. But if your likes mainly exist in special effects, of buildings, cars, or people being constantly blown up, then you wont really get a kick out of anything in this movie. Ive realized almost all of the people who dont like the Godfather are more interested in action flicks. Again, no offense taken, thats just the way I percieve it. Many people say, \"I was waiting for something to happen and nothing did so I turned it off.\"  If the restaurant scene with Solozzo and the Police Captain was not enough for you, its your loss.The whole point of it being a mafia movie is about respect and morals. Not really constant shootings and killings. But the bottom line of the movie is about one of the sons, who happens to be the brains and the innocent one of the 3, but gets involved in the family business because of family values, and sooon thereafter becomes entangled in a struggle for power, which turns him, a good guy, into a monster. Its incredible. Pacinos acting is amazing. And so are the rest of the casts, including Duvall, who is severely underrated.  People complain about Brandos voice and not being able to understand him. Thats because he got shot in the throat in a hit earlier in his life.There are alot of great movies out there. Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino...But this is in my opinion the greatest time piece ever, and most genuine. The whole movie is realistic, something that alot of people can identify with, with family morals and values and so forth. Theres hardly any bs in the movie, and the entire movie is severly captivating once you understand what is going on.Lot of good movies out there, but this one tops them all. Part 2 I liked less, but still great.", "best movie of all times": "Actually,there are few words left for me to comment on and praise the first film of the godfather trilogy.As a person who read Mario Puzo's best-seller novel, I can tell that the story is perfectly put into the movie scenario with all the scenes having grave importance.Secondly,all characters of the film,including side roles as well as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino perform a tremendous play.For example James Caan(one of my favourite actors), aka Sonny , fits very well with all his manners,looks the quicktempered, hot casanova mafia image.Besides these, the scenario is realistic and dramatic in terms of an inside picture of an Italian mafia family with all the cosa nostra traditions of 40's and before.This movie has created its mottos(an offer you can't refuse) , stable characters(I even do not have the right to criticize Marlon Brando and Al Pacino)  and unforgettable scenes.With this property this movie is the pioneer of all the other mafia tragedies and dramas.", "A masterpiece!": "One of the best gangster movies that have been released.Some people say this it the only good one in the trilogy but I disagree with that statement, although it is the best one. The story and acting are superb. Hell, Marlon Brando as The Godfather is a reason enough to watch this film. It really feels as Coppola had some inside informant give him insight on how things work in a mafia family. They are many other crime movies but in my opinions none of those is on the same level as \"The Godfather\"(that's not saying they are bad or of inferior quality of course).I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, enjoys not only crime flicks but good cinema in general.", "True modern day classic movie.": "Although not my favorite film of all time this ranks up there pretty close to the top of the pile. The cast alone is enough to make you shake at the thought of watching it. This brutal film is also funny and clever. It has bullies, cold calculating killers, bent cops, one or two nice guys, a plethera of wise guys and the dismembered head of a dead race horse thrown in (to bed) for good measure.\nOnly 8.5 out of 10 for me i'm afraid; I feel that it went on a tad too long. I believe that most films should only last for 2 hours max. Although I must confess in this case this movie could just be better than most?!Any longer than 2 hours and I would feel like I was showing off if I were a film maker if you know what I mean?? It's only my opinion though :)", "A masterpiece. Best. Film. Ever.": "I'm not too good at elaboration, so I'll keep this short and sweet - The Godfather is quite simply the greatest film ever made. Superb cast, superb acting, superb filming, superb directing, superb story...if you watch this film your life will be bettered. Al Pacino's career best performance, Marlon Brando's career best performance, and superb supporting turns from James Caan, Robert Duvall et al ensure that Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film will forever go down as a classic, the greatest film ever. Based on the classic novel \"The Godfather\" by Mario Puzo. I advise that you read that - it's absolutely fantastic, and the film stays nigh on 100% faithful to the novel. Go watch. Now.", "Awesome !": "The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the eventual \"Don.\"It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10.", "Incre\u00edble": "Alucinante, me he quedado estupefacto, boquiabierto, patidifuso, anonadado.", "A Young Man Who Takes Command of The Most Powerful Family": "Probably the best movie about criminal world, which shows all sides of people life who are involved and how their life is changed by very powerful force. And the movie about the young man who saves not his real family but also people who are even closer... The Plot makes a huge effect on viewers feelings and emotions while characters battle between life and death. This is probably the best performance of Pacino and Brando. In my opinion everyone who sees this movie will absolutely say it is good and will understand waht godfather means. Power not only makes people to fear the don but love as well, because that power if is used well it effects life in many different ways: help, destroy, make cry or smile and understand the true values of family and close friends.", "the best mafia film ever made": "The truly amazing performance by Marlon Brando as the ageing mob-boss Vito Corleone is not the only stroke of brilliance in this film. The performance by the then young Al Pacino as the youngest son Micheal was also first class. His portrayal as a young man, recently out of the army, who was determined to stay well out of his fathers business but through a series of events transformed is quite stunning. Far greater than part two and one of the best films ever made. Supported by great performances by Robert Duvall as the families adopted son and lawyer Tom Hagen and James Caan as Vito's psychotic eldest son Sonny, Brando's portrayal comes believingly to life in this fantastic film.", "Underworld dark site movie": "This is a masterpiece of world cinema..

We are not taking the picture without Michael!\" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). \"Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,\" he relates, \"and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me.\" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as \"Senator Corleone\" or \"Governor Corleone\" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot- headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero its really good", "The film of the film": "The film of the film, before the ephemeral production, technical marvel (the assembly that the godson of baptism, intersperses the prayer of Michael Corleone with the murders of which he is principal, the exceptional photography, which explores the shadow business of mafia and the light in Michael's relationship with Apollonia, pure and virginal), the force of the cast, the script that interweaves family intrigues with the struggle for power, and the perfection with which Coppola enacts its history.

To put it simply: the story is well crafted, the characters are given definition, the actors have given themselves to the roles they have been so fortunate to play and the direction is so pure that it seems effortless and almost transcends time - which is incredibly improbable to achieve when filming a period piece.This film will outlive any of the garbage we seem to accept on daily/weekly/monthly and annual basis.It may not be your go-to whenever you need to watch something but it will expand your understanding on what serious film making is about.

It is an excellent and very well done movie There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This is one of my all time favorite. This movie stands at the top in all decades. \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\"There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now.", "superb movie": "Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.", "Twenty out of ten": "Coppola's 1972 film \"The Godfather\" is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece. No other film to date has combined violence, romance and music so seamlessly. From the intertwining plot-lines to the flawless and complex character developments, everything about \"the Godfather\" was pure viewing magic. Never before, nor since, have I seen a film of such grandeur and class. The Mafia's habits are portrayed in meticulous detail - brutality towards rivals, but generosity within \"the family\". Marlon Brando's performance as \"Don Corleone\" and Al Pacino's as his son \"Michael\" are outstanding, and provide the film with sheer star quality. \"The Godfather\" is without doubt the best movie ever made, and deserves all the accolades it receives, plus some.

This movie will make you intrigued by its astounding depiction of the mafia and immerse you into its world from the very start while being impressed by its technical and narrative aspects.Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the creative decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Mario Puzo, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a memorable look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone.The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing cast of brilliant actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Richard Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire and many more. I love how the film handles Michael Corleone's character arc in this film and Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest performances in cinema history.Honestly, there's really nothing to complain about this film, as it's highly agreed to be of the greatest films in history.

I think the scene in this movie that best explains why this is an excellent movie from every angle is the baptism scene.

The roles of Tom Hagen, Sonny and of course Michael (Al Pachino) are epic and very heart touching. The sound & music gives us a feel like Italian environment in USA.

It is my opinion that there are more than 10 sequences in this fabulous movie that we can rate them as the best sequences in history of cinema.I think that story is fantastic; Marlon Brando is incredible, and all the actors and actresses are great. The ending is dramatic and music is also one of the best one. I often see the top sequences for 1 to 60 minutes. I really congratulate to Francis Ford Coppola for this excellent movie. YOU TAPE YOUR NAME IN HISTORY DEAR FRANCIS.", "Review for Godfather": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990.", "I'm speechless": "Firstly I want to apologize about my writing skill in English. Seriously, this movie was the best movies that ever been made by human. This movie will bring you to a terrific drama about family live. The storyline of this movie will amuse you. You will be brought into the movie as a main character. This movie also invite the viewers to play and think as a mafia. The Godfather also teach us about honor, loyalty, and respect. These are the main idea of this movie. Al Pacino's performance really added something to this movie. But don't you ever forget about the wise Marlon Brando performance guys. Marlon and Al really got into the movie, they acted like they are a real mafia on the real life. I can't tell you a better movies than The Godfather. If you never watch this movie, you better watch it now ! The word that close to describe The Godfather is FANTASTIC.", "Best movie I've seen!": "The best movie I have ever seen in my life!Great actors, great scenes and plot. I haven't read the book but I am planning to. A must see if you haven't!", "good moves": "This is so beautifull film , An amazing\n10 star our of 10 .", "Not just a mafia/crime movie": "It's one of the unique movies. It's not just a crime, mafia movie but it has lots of emotional moments as well. And for me it portrays the love in a family so good. And musics in this movie are just wonderful. I have the soundtracks in my phone and I love to listen them.", "Absoulute Favorite": "Honestly this is a masterpiece of it's time along with our time. The story was very solid, sent a lot of messages for interpretation, and it is truly a movie that you can watch over and over again. The classic entry to Don Corleone sends me shivers every time. The movie entices you so that you feel as if you've known these characters for a while. With that being said, it nearly broke my heart seeing Don Corleone get shot and you could feel the anger along with the rest. As Michael grew to his top dog position, you could feel the change within a second, you could immerse yourself in his world, his thoughts, and his actions (whether or not you agree with them). All in all a absolute masterpiece in which you are not allowed to die until you see this movie at least once.", "A great watch": "Never get bored of watching this movie again and again. It truly is an epic and a classical worth a billion likes and a rating of 9. 1st time I watched this movie was in my teens and had a different perspective - the violence and action really attracted me to it. But now after almost.10 years when I watch it, it gives me the view into the culture, family ties, what, why and how of the movie. All this is so engrossing and a treat to eye that one imagines what if would feel like to live in such a time or be a part of such an influential family.So for all of you just get a hang of the DVD or watch the entire collection, its worth time, money and effort. Overall suggestion a must watch for any movie buff.", "In the Top 5 greatest films ever made!": "The Godfather Saga is the best story ever. With respect to George Lucas and his Star Wars series, There is nothing better then a story about money, power, and respect in an American setting. The series starts with Part 1, The Godfather, which is in the same category with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Searchers, and Schindler's List as the best movie of there respected Genres. As good as Marlon Brando is in this film, I think that his best film was On the Waterfront and this is his last goodbye. I realize that Last Tange in Paris was a great performance, but the Godfather was an icon for generations to come. Al Pacino in this film is absolutely superb and he only made it better in Part II. Many people put The Godfather as the number 1 movie of all time and I can't argue with that because of all that it has to offer. I think that Citizen Kane is more of a landmark because of all the things that Orson Welles brought to cinema from that movie, but if that is number 1, than Coppola has no shame in being the best number 2 of all time. The amazing thing about the Godfather Saga is that I think the world of Part 1, but I think that Part 2 is better. Bravo Francis, you have made your mark on Film forever, no doubt.", "Fantastic movie": "Movie is all awesome and having a many good scenes which are also so much impressing, where ever other are just making the same thing and going or repeating again and again but this is what I call movie. Even every single is having a good quality of new moves and that makes your movie different from other creations. Keep going on and bring us a lots of good innovative ideas.", "Best Film I Have Ever Seen!": "The Film \"The Godfather\" Is Without Doubt The Best Film I Have Ever Seen, The Direction Is Perfect And The Acting Is Unbeatable.

WARNING This Review Contains SPOILERS For \"The GodFather\" So If You Don't Want Spoilers For The Godfather Leave Now You've Been Warned, And The Godfather Is A Violent Movie So If Your Not 12+ Leave Now. Lets Begin, The Film The Godfather Starts In The Wedding Of The Daughter Of Vito Or Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) Were Not So Much Violence Happens But Mainly Presents The Cast. I Wont Lie The First 0:43 Minuets Of The Film Were Not As Good As The 2:14 Hours To Follow But A Major Plot Point Comes In That Time So Its Important. The First Half Of The Film is About The Corleone's Regular Days, But All That Changes When SPOILER ALERT: Don Corleone Is Nearly Killed From Another Mafia Who Already Killed An Other Character Luca Brasi Which Changes Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) From A Good Man To The Mafia Man He Never Wanted To Become. After Michael And His Brothers Fredo And Sonny Take Charge Over The Family Until They're Dad Comes Back, They Have A Meal With A Police Officer Who Broke Michaels Jaw, Michael Shoots The Cop And His Bodyguard What Causes The Second Half Of The Film When Michael Must Fly To Italy And He Stays There For Two Years Which All Contain Him Falling In Love, Getting Marred, Finding Out His Brother Sonny Was Killed, Wanting To Go Back To New York And Having His Wife Be Killed By One Of His Bodyguards. After Michaels Wife Is Killed He Returns To New York There He Meets His Ex Girlfriend Katherine (Diane Keaton) Who He Ends Up Marring And Having A Child With. There Is A Part In The Film Were You See Don Corleone Back On His Feet Talking To Michael And That For Me Is Were His Acting As The Don Really Shins And That Is Were His Character Really Connected To Me And Made Him One Of The Best Characters Of All Time For Me. One Of The Saddest Parts In The Film Is Around The End And Huge SPOILER ALERT Here This Is Big: In A Scene You See Don Corleone And Michaels Son Playing Around The Garden When All Of A Sudden Don Corleone Falls To The Ground And Dies And In That Scene You Can Really Feel The Sadness And Are Even More Sad When Michaels Son Keeps Spraying Don With Water And Dose Not Know His Dead.

This Film Is Full Of Amazing Action And Intense Scenes Full Of Nail Biting Moments I Would Highly Suggest You Watch It If You Haven't Already And I Give It An: A+ Or A: 100/100 Or A: 11/10 Because Its That Good!.", "The TRUE depth of the Godfather": "The Godfather is the pinnacle of American Mafia in Hollywood cinematics. Besides the more than obvious storyboard of this trilogy, the godfather is filled with references to the roots of the Mafia as a criminal organisation. The opening scene of the trilogy is a beautiful display of limbo lighting and chiaroscuro effect where our attention is focused on Bounasera and Don Vito Corleone. Through the opening conversations we begin to understand the mafia's role in society; to intervene and arrange the clockwork of society when the governmental institutions have failed. We see that the underworld is a male- orientated place. There is an obvious division between work and family which is echoed through the partition between the dark and gloomy office and the bright colourful and chaotic festivities outside. Strangely enough aesthetic perfection is present in the darker realm of Don Vito's office. This hints at the suggestion that the Mafia is merely the evolution of human necessity to arrange what the judicial services can't. Throughout the films we see the Mafia is a family centric 'Business' which revolves around the paterfamilias, i.e. the head of the family. Whatever he sees just and right, all his family follow his wishes, even if they don't agree. If they don't they are aware they will suffer the consequences. The family structure is also present from the Don ,il capo to the consiglieri and further down to the henchmen. There is also a clear picture of inter winding network between the families. In the end it is obvious that when the family tries to legitimize itself it finds great difficult since the Mafia is a cycle; you enter by blood and you part by blood. The Mafia will always be present in American and Italian Society, the only question is how much shall there presence be felt?", "The Greatest Film of all Time": "The Godfather has all the qualities of a great film. Everything in it is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola has done a marvelous job in directing. The cast is superb especially the Oscar-winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting is phenomenal. It has the many of the greatest movie quotes of all time. It shows the humane side of Mafia and depicts it so beautifully that we are absorbed by it. It has immortalized Mario Puzo's novel. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is also the most entertaining film. It is a magnificent portrayal of organized crime. The themes of the movie are sublime. It induces us to empathize with criminals. It is a timeless masterpiece and an exemplary film.", "Best movie I ever seen": "One of the best 10 movies of all times and it's really amazing work.. It is here that writers Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque fair considerably better. The Palmer family's back story is well thought-out and moving, effectively allowing us to understand.If only there was slightly less story. Director David Dobkin (\"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Fred Claus\") is so consumed with Hank's myriad issues \u2013 and there are many more than what's included here \u2013 that the run time bloats to 141 minutes, which is too much for its own good. Still, Dobkin succeeds in showcasing his best asset \u2013 the ensemble \u2013 by staying out of the actors' way and allowing the material to speak for itself. It may not always work in terms of structure, tone and expedience, but it works often enough to be a solid drama.", "A must watch!": "Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen! The First time I watched this film was when I was a kid, probably about 8, and I feel in love with this type of film making.", "The Godfather of All Crime Films": "This film is the film that started so much. From the color scale to the violence and symbolisms. There is no going wrong with this film. Even though the film has been out for over 40 years, it holds it's own to anything made today.Anyone who enjoys films should see this film. Hands down.You will like this film if you like: Any crime films or television shows, like 24, CSI, Casino, The Untouchables, Empire, RockNrolla, Young Guns, etc...You will not like this film if you like films with vivid colors and bright sunny days. Or if you enjoy romance movies more then violent films. The violence in this film is often done as a point to drive across to the audience. This film and all films of the trilogy are worth watching.", "Very good movie": "Unbelievable this movie, is incredible, all the movie.", "Worth movie so world inside the underworld!": "The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Mored1984", "The Godfather... the masterpiece...": "\"The Godfather\" is much more than a story about gangsters and based on the novel by Mario Puzo mob. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful in the art of film and endowed with a classical virtuosity inspired, serves up the organization and the intrigues of the crime society to conceive of a true epic about family and about the evolution of family values \u200b\u200bduring the twentieth century. Incidentally, \"The Godfather\" is perhaps the first major cinematic chronicle of the twentieth century on the family's own twentieth century. It is a kind of self-analysis; an exercise that the time has come to prove as extraordinary.Just simple saying... watch the movie... one of the best ever produce...", "a cinematic masterpiece.": "The Godfather is one film that has continued to inspire my perception of film making. The strongest essence of the film in my opinion would be the meticulous use of Chairescureo; a term coined by Leonardo Da Vinci which typifies the sentimental use of darkness in enhancing light as exemplified in most of Don Corleone's scenes. It was easy to appreciate his thoughts and the depth of his mental resources simply by looking at the accentuated contours of his facial structure in consonance with the artistic elements of each scene; especially when he smokes the cigar.The cinematography was top notch and the visual feel and intensity of the movie was tactically consistent throughout the film and was further embellished by the music score and soundtracks which i find very moving.Godfather is just the way I want to shoot movies.", "Truly awesome movie": "This movie is so epic. One of the best movies in the universe, that's for sure, worth watching for everyone. The actors are great, casting is great and plot blows your mind. Unbelievable experience. It's amazing that 40 years later it still holds up. It brings out different emotions. And Al Pacino is a wonderful actor. The Godfather is fantastic from start to finish, there isn't a single second that felt off to me. It runs for almost 3 whole hours, and each second is utter perfection. It's a testament to the strength of the screenplay when you can sit in one spot and watch the film for twice the length of most feature films and be totally riveted and enthralled the whole time. This is a long, long movie, but not a single instant is wasted.", "Milestone in History": "This movie is one of the milestones of movie industry and one that considered a real art from all aspects. it is a must for any person and will be for the coming 50 years at least, The cast, writer, producer and director, all did a perfect job, resulting in this master piece of a movie. I recommend this for any one with all three parts, without any hesitation.", "Super": "Old cult cinema. Great movie. Some movies you just have to see. Although the production is young, it really keeps you in suspense. You could do it with little effort cool movie in the seventies. It is known that there were so many sound effects and light but there feel the atmosphere of American cinema. May passion for cinema is one of the two because the first is a medical emergency, major who is studying for two years. I hope that in the future I will be able to help people and work in a close-knit team of people who have a passion for what they do. Certainly, however, will not give up keeping abreast of what goes on the screen. Only in recent films miss the message. The focus is to contract the most popular actor. Increasingly, however, are valued directors who are not afraid to make difficult subjects, it can sometimes controversial. I like the cinema.", "We got it wrong": "All the fan of the godfather trilogy got it wrong. This is not a story about the mafia or gangster or tough guys. This is a story about family. This a story about a youngest son of the family taking things in his own hand so that he can take care of his family. For that , he will do anything that is necessary.", "Il Padrino, a Fan's Perspective": "It has been around thirty years since the movie was released. Even longer ago was it written. A movie this memorable is not just another trilogy. The Godfather has everything. Cinematography that is impeccable, old stars, new stars, plot turns, fantastic acting, but most importantly realism. The characters are real in the viewers mind. We see them grow, especially if you follow the story into The Godfather Part II, and we see their personalities and reactions.The casting is probably the greatest thing about the movie. Granted, there were a few questionable ones in The Godfather Part III, but only two, really. When I was growing up watching this movie, I did not know that Marlon Brando was the Godfather. As I grew older I had to look for pictures of him in something else; I could not see him as any other character or in any other movie, he was so into his role. Coming from a life-long fan, yes, I have my biases. But aside from that I still think everyone should at least watch the first one.", "An Amazing Movie": "This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz", "brilliant": "i honestly don't consider this a movie , i never saw the actors look so natural in the way they talk, dress, eat, walk ,etc.actors,characters,music,reactions,facial expressions ,simply everything is brilliant.Al pacino ,the only actor i want to have a conversation with. u cant really tell that he is acting. i felt like i can ask him about that life. as if he really lived it.the music takes me to a place where i never wanna leave.i cant stop writing about how this movie is the one and the only , just don't miss it.", "Godfather- Movie Great": "You can't comment that the Godfather is a bad movie if you haven't seen all three. The \"first movie\" is actually the first part of a three movie story. It isn't three separate movies; it's three parts of one story. The third movie sums it all up. If you say you don't like the Godfather, watch the second and third parts and then comment. You cannot intelligently comment on a story that you haven't heard all of.And if you think the movie is boring, why did the book sell so well? Why has the movie endured for so long? The story must be a good one. If you don't like it, chances are you just don't get it. The movie isn't about a mafia family. It's about the life of one man (Michael Corleone) and his personal struggles with what he has done and what he believes he is forced to do to protect his family.", "One of the Greatest Motion Pictures of All Time": "This is the movie that introduced me to my adulthood. At 19 years old, when I first seen The Godfather Trillogy back in 2013, I was enlightened to what film making was all about. In my own words, film is created to mirror society and to broaden your experiences while living on this earth through the moving motion pictures. What I experienced through this film was how to respect family morals, different contrast to business behavior, and most importantly how to discern who to trust. This film tells a thorough storyline from beginning to end. It's not just a mobster movie, but a family and business movie as well that journey's you through the never ending trials and tribulations that can come with working with a family business.

The depth of characters. The drama. The griping story. Everything is just perfect. Pacing of this movie is a bit slow at times but it's needed to build up to something bigger if you know what I mean. And the soundtrack? Beautiful music which fits perfectly for the movie. Nino Rota did a great job. Marlon Brando as godfather was the best casting for the role ever! He just showed how acting should be done. Again one the well made and perfectly crafted movies ever. If you haven't seen this. You are really missing out! Go ahead and watch it right now!

Great Direction. Flawless acting. Entertaining & thrilling moments. In short a great movie. Easily the best crime drama I have seen. Loved watching every moment of it. Marlon Brando is easily at his best in this movie. Along with several other actors. A must watch for all movie buffs. Especially the fans of crime drama genre. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right.", "Best Best": "This is the second best movie i have ever seen in my life. People knew that back in the 70's and still today it is unmatched in quality and realism. The length of the movie was perfectly acceptable otherwise we would never get the whole story.

Only Aliens was better movie for me. It is hard to find word to describe that movie. There no mistakes in Godfaher. Whole movie is brilliant. Long epic movie about crime, love, power and other stuff.

With director/writer Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay Mario Puzo. And boasting a star studded cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Abe Vigoda to name a few. In my humble opinion there was little to no chance that this wouldn't be a standard setting blockbuster movie. This is the story of the Corelione Italian mafia family and their rise in power as well as a look inside the family business with a emphasis on their relationship with each other. Their struggles to keep control of the family power and the internal struggles and pressures of mob versus mob fighting to end the Coreleone family control. Due to events that occur cause Don Coreleone to think about stepping down to bring young Michael(Al Pacino)to the head of the family business of which he is reluctant and self doubting if he is up for the responsibility that goes with the title.

The way the movie is set up, how the family is always first, is just so true. Im Argentine, of Italian descent, and it shows how Italians are, always the family, and you never mess with the family. It shows how the early years of the US Mafia was, even thought this is not based on a true story, it does show how the Mafia was.

A Classic !!! they tried making movies like it but they could not. I watched all 3 parts and always recommend it to my friends. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay. its a Must watch.Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic , all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be).Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels)", "top 5 Favorite movie": "I watched this for the first time when I was very young loved it then & still love it. to waste time i'll talk about love i had a girlfriend resonantly that i thought i loved but actually i just needed somebody at the time she talked about so many things i didn't really care about, at her ugly day i thought she was really ugly & to me those are two signs that tell you when you you love or don't love someone because like in the movie here was love and hate & so on, I know this because the son liked the girl when she was at her ugliest & cared about what she talked about.......

The acting, the well thought out scenes, the actions. Its all here and its made for a great classic which has stood the test of time after 30+ years! Al Pacino is awesome as is Marlon Brando. The ruthless streak to Pacino is horrifyingly chilling and is brilliantly acted. It deserves to be at number one because it is that good! My favourite movie of all time with some classic quotes! The way Coppola shows loyalty, respect and not playing by the rules are all shown and this makes for great viewing. Pacino's best film in my opinion!\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!\" \"You come to me with this one favour but you show no respect\" \"I love America\"", "Great men are not born great, they grow great ...": "Oh Dear Lord, where to start... Watched it again yesterday and decided to give it a review. This movie is pure excellence from Francis Ford Coppola. Great script, marvelous acting, superb cast and over the top directing. Brando as Vito Corleone is simply remarkable and the progression of Michael Corleone (Pacino) is just impressive. Great work from both actors. It is hard that there would ever be something close to The Godfather. Everything that needs to be in a movie piece, The Godfather has it. Relationships, family, real life, loyalty and greed made this movie something worth the attention. All mixed up with an artistic touch made it a number one classic for me.

From the beginning of the movie one can identify an uncle, or a family member with one of the characters. The story line just takes you in great journey, from the na\u00efve and idealist Michael to the cold and calculated killer he becomes when he takes charge of the family business. The loss, the gains, the falls, and victories of the Corleone's family, we can feel them as ours as well. We can see how the moral code changes from Don Vito Corleone's leadership, and Michael's way to handled business. Don Vito Corleone to my point of view who have not killed his daughter's husband, for him it was all about the family, and community. I think Michael's difference was that everything was giving to him, and he grew up in an environment of richness, where in Don Vito Corleone, he suffered poverty, and worked really hard to get that kind of power, and his number one motive was the well being of family and community. Michael not having this kind of life experiences took a decision that marked his life, and we as spectators could live and suffer with these characters. A wonderful movie to watch again and again, the more you watch it, knew things you'll be able to discover.", "The Masterpiece": "I really watch every single movie in the top 250, and a lot more in all my life, but there is nothing close to The Godfather I and II, also Part III is a great ending to this trilogy.

This is for sure, a MUST WATCH.", "I am glad I could be able to watch this": "I am young so I still have lots of classics movies to discover. I've heard lots about The Godfather but here in my beautiful hometown DVD's can even get more expensive than somewhere else or in the US. So I've asked a friend who has the treelogy and I've eventually watched it and I've liked it very much. There is the violent bit but the movie also speak from heart to the hearts. The horse-head scene was scary and so were the scene with Sonny being shot with a crowd of bullet. Nevertheless there was this beautiful scene with heartwarming moments and history of Italian emigration to the Americas. I am looking very forward to seeing Godfather 2 and 3.

Really depicts the real life happenings of the mostly glamorized life of crime bosses.Whats amazing is that there is a lot of life and sub-stories in the movie. The Godfather is not even the central character.The actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so \"The Godfather\" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller.I love the decor it makes the film authenticate since its the decor you would expect from the 1940's. Its filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry.", "What happened To the original version of this film": "I would like to know what happened to this film and why was it edited and not available in it,s original version any more.I know Coppola edited it for television around 1976 and the standard version that is available now is a very wimpy version of the film I saw in 1972 and a few more times in the mid seventies.First of all the sex scene between Sonny and Lucy actually showed some nudity,where in the current version it just shows the end part.All of the foul language is all edited or overdubbed,and the scene where Sonny is assassinated is missing some frames and is less violent than it,s original form.I am a big fan of James Can and the scene where he gets the news of his fathers shooting has been removed along with where he tells his mom about it.After he gets the phone call from Connie because Carlo beat her again it cuts the part out where Sonny comes storming out of the house using the four letter word three or four times.This is also missing.The Godfather (uncut) is the best film ever made and was James Caans most searing performance.I would like to know if I can find it anywhere as I have been searching for over twenty years now and am deeply saddened that such a fine movie was ruined.Help please.", "The Best Movie of All Times and the Greatest of All": "Godfather is awesome. It is one of the movies which inspired me to give time to my family. As the Godfather has said, \"a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real men\", this movie made me think that family is so important. No matter what is your business, you must spend time with your family. And don't even ask me about the acting. Marlon Brando is really a Godfather. His acting was one of the best of all times. And this movie is the reason that I started watching Al Pacino's movies. He is the greatest actor I have ever seen. He is a legend. And the way he acted in all parts of Godfather, I don't have any words to praise him. He is the Godfather of Hollywood.", "gooood": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]\u2014and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990.", "An incredible experience.": "(Short overall review) I watched \"The Godfather\" in 2013. It was broadcast Sunday evening at 20:00 and the sequel and prequel followed after one week each. At the time, my most favorite movie was only one. Even though I had watched numerous classics and modern films (Lord of the rings, Starwars, etc) I could only say \"This is my favorite movie\" to one production. But after I watched \"The Godfather\" the number increased. To say anything bad for this film will be an abomination. I have given several 10s in IMDb, to films I like, but I have always realized that if this was an official review I couldn't give 10 to any of them. That is not true for this one. This film truly deserves a 10 and will remain on the top of my list of the greatest movies of all time.", "The Greatest Movies": "As for what I consider to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen", "A Legend": "It's the Mona Lisa of the films and cult film that never will be old.

It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie.", "Belissimo!": "The Godfather is the pinnacle of cinematic art. In no other film have I seen an equivalence in any general aspect of the film. This is special considering how extremely picky I am in terms of movies, but if I would have the opportunity to change this film, I would not. I consider The Godfather to be a single film, not three separate ones. the reason I have so much respect for this particular film is because it encompasses all the values I find most important in life; trust, honor, family and culture. Those are the four that I value completely. This film represents such emotion that I cannot begin to describe how I feel about it now. Plus, most of my favorite actors are in this film; Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, etc...", "The G.O.A.T.": "Movies don't get better than that and its been 50 years since that movie.

I could not possible pick a favorite scene because there are one too many iconic moments in this film. Of course if an offer I could not refuse was made to me... There would not be much I could do if you know what I mean. Al Pacino is still my favorite actor, the godfather movies are the reason!", "A film that everyone needs to see!": "This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The best possible visual outcome of the definite word 'Mafia' would be 'The Godfather'. From hearing the Italian accent to grasping the tone of underworld organized crime, this movie provides ground for the marvelous portrayal of seemingly oblivious to conceptualize.Aspects of filming criteria, this movie is a sure criterion. Lucidity of screenplay, exemplary art direction, spontaneous acting, portraits of frame after frame with artistry had made this movie a topmost exemplar in regard of film education. To enlighten the topic, the lucidity of acting deserves far more credit than it can be written in a compact overview. The picturization of Sicilian eccentricity had been executed with a great prowess. When legendary Marlon Brando appears with a simple yet kindling shot, the whole movie sets off to a placid smooth flow. Integration of great Al Pacino from the two distinctive prospectus, one is a must to be edged to the seat while pondering over the transformation of Michael Corleone. Story line combines us with the explicit overview of Sicilian uprising crime in America. But, what we get from the movie is the greater contradiction of human nature, genuine compulsion for setting higher in the hierarchy and ecstasy of human prudence for family. Along with the lecherous underworld personnel, we get the celestial depiction of a don who is resolute in decisions, morally high in his immoral activities, in total control of the kernel of power with expertise. As the inevitable occurs, the legacy passes and bewilders the framework highly. In spite of possible complexities we get the taste of a single man enthroning the summit. It serves us with the latent ambition of every man to taste the eternity, dignity and complexity. From the point of any aspect, this movie provides the perfect aura for any audience whether looking for cinematic excellence or compact perfection of intricate plot. From my point of view it deserves a straight 9 out of 10. I have not given 10 because of some redundant cross dissolves.", "This movie is made for MEN, not for kids.": "Till watching this movie I was confused which is the best movie I have seen, but after watching this movie I got answer that this is not only my favorite but also world's best movie ever made.There are many characters in movie so people get confused and say movie was boring. Actually they don't understand the deepness of characters. Also there are many people who said \"we liked this movie at second watch\" because at first watch they did not adjust themselves with many movie characters. There are many characters and every character has his/her story. Story of movie is flawless and exceptional. Dialogues of movie are still considered as best movie dialogues in film industry. Everyone appreciated acting of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, but acting by James Caan (Sonny), John Cazale (Fredo), Diane Keaton (Kay), Richard Costellano (Clemenza) and also Sollozzo, Carlo Rizzi, Connie were also very good. Direction was also very good. Also watch the style of actors, watch when Brando moves his hand for signifying that give water to Bonasera. Also watch Pacino's acting in the restaurant, like he was hurt from inside and would do anything to save the attempt on his father or family. Movie is based on book written by Mario Puzo. I have also read the book and it is also very good and flawless like movie. And listen the music given by Nino Rota, masterpiece. The best thing of movie is Michael was innocent boy who didn't want to mix up in his family business, but when danger things come to your family , you have to take the commands, forget everything and save your family. And last thing I want to add is, if you don't get the movie in first watch, don't comment anything, watch the movie second time, understand the characters. You will like the movie. And 9.2 is less ratings, movie deserves 9.5 or more. It deserves first place not second.", "great raffia movie": "I believe the Godfather is the greatest film all time. Marlon Brando, who at first wasn't interested to play Don Vito Corleone, put down his most stunning performance ever. The characteristics, the voice of Brando match perfect with the some kind of mysterious Vito Corleone. This film is also the real start of the career of Al Pacino. After he played Michael Corleone, he was immediately given the role of young cop Serpico one year later in 1973. The best actors of two following eras meet here in this film. But the Godfather is more than just Brando or Pacino. We must certainly not forget the brilliant performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, all Oscar nominated. John Cazale playing Fredo Corleone stays a bit in the background. I liked him better in part 2.

Should I marvel at the mesmerizing story that surrounds you ever so sweetly or should I wonder about strong undertones which reveal themselves like shooting starts. Should I admire the vivid visualization of the dream or should I talk about the truth that emerges from it. Godfather might be a great movie to others but to me it is a journey through human mind, candid and knowing. The motives of a man and the eternal conflict with direction. All that is said about 'good', reveals itself in the story of this bad man. I am a fan of Vito Carlione, he is wise, he is respectful, he is a true capitalist. He is not bad himself but does not mind employing bad means. After all, some body has got to do the exploration. I can't say how thankful I am to people who made this movie for not spoiling my imagination. A truth well told is the biggest achievement.", "Coool": "It insists upon itself.

I didn't want to check it out because it has been said its been the one of the greatest gangster films of all time. Thought it was just a film the was blown up and given so much praise because its what it is, The Godfathers. I finally gave it a shot and, although great i did not care to view the sequels.

Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialog is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy about it.", "The Cinema Masterpiece!": "The best movie of all time.

Though part 2 might itself be a better film, i love the Corleone family because of the first one. Every time i see it, i remember why these people feel like family to me: sonny is like an obnoxious older brother sometimes, hot headed, but genuinely loving and caring. Tom is the level headed man, who takes into consideration the wisest way to handle things and benefit the family. Fredo is the one that everyone loves, just because he can't take care of himself. and Michael, he's everyman isn't he? He has dreams and goals and wants to live his life independent of the influence of his family. but circumstance formulates, and deepens his character. He soon chooses a path that he swore he never would, but he is almost forced to do it. Granted, no one is pointing a gun to his head- but his heart compels him.and Don Vito himself. An aging king who's love for his family is what keeps him alive even after a brutal assassination attempt. What is he to do about his kingdom? he knows he has little time left, yet, his sons imperfections and his own regrets (though he says he has none) leave him questioning the future. I draw a parallel here to King Lear and even Kurosawa's Ran- Vito Corleone is much like the principal characters in these other two works, though more composed and strong in mind.Look beyond the violence, the slick talk, the plot. See the love, the family, the relationships. You'll be able to see your own family in the Corleones, as imperfect as they are (being that we need to remember that they are monsters, who murder people for personal gain) and more importantly, you'll be able to see yourself. Not one of us can say that we're any better- we can only say that we've chosen a different road.", "Overvalued.": "I had great expectations on this trilogy because of everybody says it was good.

I would put this film in the same class of Lawrence of Arabia, Citzen Cane, and Casablanca which are all great films. I just feel that they are giving far to much praise that is not deserved. People even consider this the greatest film of all time which makes me scratch my head because the second one is far superior. With that being said, what makes this movie is Marlon Brando's Performance. Evan though he considered to young for the Role of Vito Corleone, he seems to pull it off without any effort. Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, also brings it in this film playing a Character that want to desperately avoid the criminal world that his family is involved in but is forced to get involved due to circumstances that I will not Spoil. The cast is this film is superb and they all play character that come across as real and fleshed out. You actually believe they are related to one another. This combined with an interesting plot makes for great watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is new to mobster movies and is trying to get the feet wet. This is one of Francis Ford Coppala's best.", "Review for The Godfather": "An acclaimed film that deserves its acclaim, The Godfather validates the crime epic and explores the dark side of the American dream. The Godfather is simply a classy production; unlike the mass of movies, most of which can each be criticized on some level, The Godfather manages to engage its audience throughout, and the portrayals of Brando, Pacino and Duvall, to name a few, were instant classics. Moreover, the film is memorable, in particular for its performances, assured direction and insightful depiction of the corridors of power of the American Mafia (not to mention it's extremely quotable). I did not give it ten out of ten for this reason: it did not move me so much as some other films. The Godfather is not my favorite movie, but I can see how for many people it is.", "One for the history books": "Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made. Way beyond its time, it ticks the list of what every film should be looking to achieve if they want to make a great film.

Don't miss an opportunity to see a classic such as this on the big screen. The Godfather films remain so powerful, so ubiquitous, because in the Corleones we see the American Dream -- and in turn, ourselves. So it's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great.

It is almost the equal of family. - Don Corleone\"Be prepared for a fairly involved plot with plenty of long conversation scenes. Great acting and great depiction of total moral downfall.I really like the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent. Every facial expression and every word of dialogue was brilliantly judged.", "Good Movie!!!": "Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, \"Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?\" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to \"11\" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of \"oscillating\" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) \"zoom out\" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film.", "To Watch Again and Again...": "I once lived in a house with a gym and the others rented all the Godfather videos and played them back to back continuously forom Friday to Monday allowing anyone to come in and watch them.\nThe room was full all weekend and I didn't go out for four days... and you know what?

In multiple instances throughout the movie an orange or the color orange is seen with or on someone that is involved in a violent act.

The succession of the kingdom is the absolute reward for some and the absolute curse for others. There is something utterly seductive about the lighting of the movie, the stories (from the main stories to the secondary characters), about the ongoing feeling that danger lies around the corner, that this life is never safe and that you must, as popular Italian culture suggests, do everything for the family. \"In my youngest and more vulnerable years\" I wrote an essay about the role/position of women in the Godfather. I wrote about the flaws of the Godfather, about how, because it was filmed from the side of the family, you couldn't see the illegitimate character of the Corleone family's work. I wrote about the misogynist approaches and the utterly patriarchal viewpoints of the movie. I wrote about the inherent racism towards other ethnic minorities. But I still can't escape the spell. I still can't believe this feeling when Michael goes to the hospital to see Vito and he protects his father as is in his imaginative nature.

Talia Shire and James Caan give good performances, but not as remarkable as Brando's. The atmosphere of the movie is aided by the darkness in some of the settings, particularly those of the house.

Never gets old to watch!", "the family": "Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a \"Jewish Godfather\"; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an \"Oriental Godfather\"; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a \"modern day Godfather.\"If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their \"adopted\" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from \"innocent\" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \"throne\", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word \"Mafia\" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.", "Just Watch": "It's telling you something.Watch before you die , maybe you will not like it but you will understand what I mean.", "Masterpece": "MASTERPIECE BRO WTF DUDE AMAZING GODFATHER PLS BE MY DAD", "Amazing, Spectacular, Flawless!": "Although I watched the movie a logn time ago, it is just unforgettable!

Maybe, you have to watch it two times at least for best understanding.For me, this is the best Francis Ford Coppola's movie. He has known how to adapt the Mario Puzo's novel to the wide screen. The Godfather II is good as well, so any of them can be your favorite. I highly recommend this movie, and I'm sure you will want to see it many times. It lasts about 3 hours, but you won't feel it. Now, you have to plan to see this movie and enjoy. Then you could watch Godfather II and III if you want more.", "k": "Seem pretty boring for me want my type, plus its an old movie", "The ultimate no. 1 movie for me!": "Great gangster movie, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood.

The Godfather simultaneously along many roads: the socio-political analysis (the corruption of the authorities to the Cuban revolution), the Bildungsroman, the traditional gangster film, the protest film (especially in the third chapter), then go back where he started, more and more dark and bitter, closing in on itself. In full respect of the rules of tragedy, from the ancient Greeks to the New Hollywood. Ambassador of narrative classicism tinged cinefilia and spiced with personal experiences of its director, fascination with corruption and violence as inherent in the construction of power factors of both a family and a nation, conjunction of talents in adverse conditions with successful results and unexpected, the proof that even in the most unexpected place can wait a stainless classic, the Godfather is all that and the opportunity to see this in a movie theatre is a pending issue that many viewers or not viewers should have fulfilled.", "Inspiring, Reinventing, Appreciate": "This movie series is a lot inspiring to explain the world we are leaving in.

The directing is so spot on in my opinion the second best directed film Coppola strives for such realism you can see it in the scene with the dead horse the actor wasn't aware that there would be a dead head in his bed and the head is real from a real horse so is scream is so authentic. The opening scene and ending scenes has so much detail and symbolism that I can't even go into details. The pacing is f.....g amazing you never get bored even thou it's 3 hours long when ever you are close they hit you with a scene that just blow up and you are fully hooked again. The script is amazing a great story and so many quotable lines the story has so many twist and turn and the characters always feel real the dialogue is spot on delivering so much suspense and information so effectively. The Score it's probably the best score of all times I have never heard a score that fits the movie so perfectly and could also work effectively as normal music it delivers so much suspense and, the best pieces are the godfather waltz (the start) and the baptism these pieces deliver suspense information are are just great I sometimes start hearing these pieces in my head because they are so good. The cinematography is also some of the best of its kind the lighting conveys so much information and every scene is framed perfectly every scene could be a painting. And that is just some of the reasons why the godfather is one of the best film of all time and not overrated (I still respect your opinions).", "The Best Film of all time": "Being taken on a ride with this family and how they operate in and out of the family unit is amazing.

Some of my friends read the book. From their information, I saw the movie. It was fantastic. And I know there were some immigrants from Italy. And Italian was a common language in some parts of the USA in 1940's and 1950's. The climax was one of the best movies. A different one. Yes, It is copied for new gen movie.

Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark.

Robert Duvall gives a phenomenal performance as Tom Hagen. He gave a good depth to the film by him trying to convince Michael and The Godfather about all the things that they are doing are bad. And James Caan gives a great performance as Sonny, who likes to get himself in trouble. Then, Marlon Brando plays in his Oscar winning role as Don Vito Corleone or The Godfather. He was amazing as the Don. The way he acted with his voice, and his hand movements, and you could just feel his reign of power over everyone else, but you can sense that his control his failing when the other five families try to kill him in the process. Now, let's talk about Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. I still do not understand why Al Pacino has not won an Oscar for his role as Michael. Especially for his role in The Godfather Part II. Al Pacino blew me away with his performance. What I like the most about his character was it showed his character arc perfectly. It shows how he realizes that the only way that he can protect his father is become part of the family business, and Pacino portrays that aspect of his character so well. For the way the film was done, it was done great. I liked all the hazes of grey and brown everywhere, it gave it an older feel to it, which made it very good. And the score composed by Nino Rota is absolutely great. It fit the feel of the movie great, I hum it all the time, so I give the movie big credit for that. But, probably the biggest thing in this movie that makes it shine, and I would give it the most credit for, is how this film perfectly balances the struggling life of the Corleone family, and the ugly violence of their life in the mafia. It balances it great, I am in awe in how they were able to balance it, because most movies today when they try to do that, they usually tip more towards one subject over the other. But The Godfather keeps those two story lines balanced throughout the entire three hour run time of the movie. And another thing that I have to say, or else I am absolutely insane not to mention this, are the amount of famous quotes in this movie! This movie is filled with lines that you will be saying constantly, like the famous line \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!\" by Vito Corleone, or \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli.\" that other movies copy off of all the time! So, this really is probably the best movie I have ever seen, I have no flaws with this movie, which is why I shall give this movie a 10/10, and I highly suggest you check this movie out, it is an amazing experience!", "Words are not enough to praise this movie.": "The Godfather is one a kind movie that every person must watch before giving a critic review to any other movies. Set in the period of dominance of the Italian Mafia in the USA, it never fails to disappoint us. This movie was released in 1972. 1972. It can easily beat movies that are released in the 21st century in terms of acting, directing, casting, screen play and what not.The movie team has indeed put a lot of effort in this and should be appreciated. They have revolutionized the movie industry and have given a name to stand up for.Don't support PIRACY.", "The Godfather Film": "Plot Summary The godfather film is a crime novel that written by Italian American author called Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. This Classic film was first published in 1972 based on a fictional story of a mafia family that lived in New York City. The Film showcases a crime novel that consists of the war between the Don Corleone family, the mob and four other mafia families in New York city and Staten island in New York. After Don Vito Corleone being shot by a man who works for drug dealer Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo. The tension rises and Corleone's two sons Michael and Sonny Corleone are left with no choices but run the family business with the assistance of consigliere Tom Hagen and two caproreglieres. The death of their father becomes a major tragedy and loss to their family but Micheal Corleone decides to seek for revenge on his father's death by murdering all of his father's enemies. Theme of the Film \"Its business, not personal has been a slogan in this film. Power, dominance and respect has also been a main theme of achievement in the don Corleone family and the mafia families. This film also shows a range variety of American Italian traditions of the don Corleone family, the rules and rituals that shows a great focus and the ways of living their lives in world of full of crime. Last but not Least, this classic film shows a brilliance in his son on taking responsibilities in order to protect his family after the death of his father. However lately its arguably that he ends up causing conflict between himself and his family. Techniques and styles in the film This film has used different key elements and style to create a masterpiece. The usage of various sound and melodies; the Italian melodic music has been a major use in transition of one scene into another. Also the film has been directed with various camera angles and focus such as using the ironic montage and close up angles of the main characters.In the first scene in the meeting, the camera tends to slowly focus on the main character Don Corleone and later fades to other characters in the meeting. This allows audience to focus on what's the main character is portraying and saying in that scene. Conclusion I have enjoyed watching this classic film and find this story to be very well articulated. The story was very artistic with great characters that tracks down the roots of mafia crimes and traditions. however, I also find the film to interesting because of the them that has been portrayed and the urge of power, respect and dominance is inevitable in the mafia world.", "The best movie i have ever seen in my entire life": "Now, i would like to point out that i am not an expert by any means, and also that i was never a fan of older movies to the point where i would never have watched a movie that was realesed for more than 20 years.

Francis Ford Coppola is one hell of a director. The mix of suspense, drama and the mafia story is just brilliantly done. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando did awesome acting.Nino Rota's music is so well done.Rota's score for The Godfather had been nominated for a 1973 Academy Award for Best Original Score. However, it was disqualified from consideration when the Academy learned Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the film Fortunella (1958).Nonetheless, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Score, despite the fact that it contained the same piece.Overall a great experience that makes you wanna come back to it.", "Great Cinematography": "Shots are well framed and awesome cinematography by Gordon Willis ASC.This is a great film with great Crew Story is mind blowing\nThis movie has 3 Oscar (Academy Awards)", "9 out of 10": "Its just one of those classics that you can watch time and again, remembering this was shot in the late 60s early 70s, some or a lot still struggle to create this kind of quality today with millions more of budget, this is definitely the 'Godfather' of the Mafia films, and has paved the way for a lot of those great quotes like ' Leave the gun.

The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathise with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organised crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): Don't ever take sides against the family.", "A one time hit ....": "See something new every time I see it.A right mixture of tragedy and comedy.Found a common love and appreciation everywhere screened.

The dark atmosphere provides the viewer with a visual representation of the shadiness of the Corleone family. The directing and editing are beautiful, with scenes like the baptism killings and Michael's killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey showcasing this. The acting performances are fantastic, some of the best I have ever seen. Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone left a mark on me after seeing it. Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Vigoda, and Castellano all portray their characters perfectly. There is not much else that can be said about how fantastic this movie is.

Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and Western culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Particularly when trying to understand how the establishment and the corporations that form operate today, having drawn so many lessons from the modus-operandi of mafias and narco-trafficking cartels around the globe. The CEO's of Barclays and HSBC as the latest incarnations of what Marlon represents in the title role of this film: an all-consuming, naked ambition of power, who are always more than ready and eager to splash vast quantities of other people's blood in the pursuit of profit, while hiding behind minions to do it.This film continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, Gordon Willis' chiaroscuros, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously, like the French New Wave and Free Cinema in the UK had done before them.", "God Father!": "Its amazing film so far.

It is not only the montage of the same, also the plot, costume, interpretation of the actors, and the intrinsic message that contains. The film is timeless, it does not matter in the year that was made, because at any time is a reference of a well-done story and good cinema. The subject of the mafia always intrigues, everyone wants to know about it regardless of what they consider, whether it is good or bad, because they are well-planned organizations in which discipline, and respect for the word do functional. The godfather collects all these elements, jointly by the love for the family, and not only the family of the home, but family is the whole organization.

Both The Godfather 1 and The Godfather 2 are equally good in my opinion but cannot say the same about The Godfather 3.", "The arguable pinnacle of American filmmaking": "The Godfather is a cultural landmark. More than being just a film, it manages to tell a story of an American family in the post-war era. This family just happens to be different from most. What makes the film such a monumental triumph is how it manages to be a massive popular success while also being an undeniable artistic triumph. The cast is one of the greatest in the history of the medium. Brando delivers a performance of quiet enormity. His sidelong glances and hand gestures do just as much talking as his dialogue. Pacino is so perfectly cast as Michael Corleone that one is amazed to find out how many doubted him for the role. James Caan has never been better as Sonny Corleone. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are also perfect in their roles as well. Coppola's direction is magistral. The wedding sequence combined with Vito answering favors in his office is a brilliant piece of work. All of the principal characters are introduced, and exposition is delivered in such a subtle fashion that you might not realize it's happening. We instantly find out all of the necessary character information of these people and it's done in a way that makes it all seem effortless. The film's major sequences are so well done, they are seared into our collective consciousness. The restaurant hit by Michael, the horse's head in the bed, the Sicily sequence, the assassination of Sonny, and the Baptism massacre are all handled in a way that makes them feel like an odd mix of dark slices of Norman Rockwell nostalgia and Catholic mythology. The pioneering cinematography by Gordon Willis turned every form of lighting into a thematic weapon. The darks are so dark, and the rest of the color pallet has a glow that, again, seems to make the film look like Norman Rockwell, or old photographs, adding to the nostalgia. The music is some of the finest ever composed for a motion picture, and I get goosebumps whenever I hear it. The editing is a marvel, look at the previously mentioned Baptism massacre for some of the best in history. In short, The Godfather is a masterpiece on every level and this is only the surface, one can dig much deeper into the film, and you'll find a story of America itself. But, that is beyond the scope of this review. I'll just say, if you somehow haven't seen this artistic milestone, get on it, and witness the start of the greatest saga (at least for the first 2 films) in American cinematic history.", "must watch": "Amazing movie.

Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled \"box-office poison\".

Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?

I love Brando's performance, and the way that Micheal Corleone's character is developing thru the film, Robert Duvall is great as Tom Hagen and James Caan as the hot-headed Santino opposite to everything that is Michael Corleone.

While I agree that it is extremely well made, written, and produced, there are some points that make me take a step back and need a second look.The Godfather shows many points of the life of the Corleone family. Starting with the happy time of Connie Corleone's wedding and slowly spiraling into madness, finally ending with the \"crowning\" of a new Don and a new generation. But in-between, the pieces can be hard to fit together.My biggest thing about it is that instead of feeling like a movie with a giant story, it feels more like multiple short films made to fit together. These short films as I call them have very little, if any, ties to each other. Obviously it is the same characters but these could be a movie all on their own. The stories seem to be: The Wedding, The Narcotics Saga/Vito's Close Call, The Corleone's Go to Sicily, Sonny and Connie's Troubles, The Vegas Move, and The Rise of the New Don.The only other complaint I have with this movie is the fact that it is hard to narrow in on a specific timeline. It seems to open in the 1920's but between the opening scenes and the end of the movie, the scenes in between have no real sense of when this was happening. For example, time from when Michael has to flee the country to when he marries Apollonia feels like it should be a couple months, at the very least. But according to the shiner we see on Michael's face, it couldn't have been more than a week or two. Quite the reasonable amount of time to fall in love! Another would be the the time skip between when Michael takes over the family business to when Vito Corleone finally passes. Other than that, I agree that the movie definitely deserves the praise and reputation it has created for itself for almost the past 50 years! The dialogue, the soundtrack, and the cast are nothing short of fantastic.", "G>O>A>T": "This is The Greatest Film of all time in its Genre.", "A Once in a life time experience!": "A must watch. a once in a life time experience.

Thanks for this film and story.", "Precious": "It's a great movie and iconic film i've ever watched and i'm so excited to watch it n i've watched it more than 6 times", "\"Leave the gun, take the cannoli.\"": "In this Godfather's hyper-violent Waltz it is strictly business, kill, or be killed. The Godfather trilogy directed by Francis Ford Coppola is legendary among movie-critics and fans alike, and capturing generation after generation in the sad, and hungry world of mid-twentieth century organized crime. The casting is excellent with Marlon Brando as the legendary Vito Corleone, the namesake of this film: The Don, the Godfather. Following is Al Pacino's breakout role as Michael Corleone, the youngest of the three Corleone brothers. The story focuses primarily around the Corleone family as a whole, though Michael takes a primary seat as main character as the story progresses further. The family is very close, as shown in the opening scene at Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding with the big Italian family singing Luna Mezz O' Mare laughing, and having a right old time. Contrast that with Michael who is sitting at a table by himself, almost ashamed of the family he belongs to. He even goes as far as to tell his girlfriend that \"It's my family, Kay. It isn't me\" when she asks him about the deal that the Don made that couldn't be refused. On the opposite of the quiet Michael is the hotblooded Sunny (James Caan) Corleone, the oldest of the three, smashing cameras of photographers trying to get a picture, and even so much as spitting on the badge of an FBI agent checking license plate numbersFrancis Ford Coppola loves to use close-up scenes meant to inspire uneasiness, or dread followed by wide shots of the characters. A half eaten sandwich is of no real concern to most people, and does not deserve a close-up for the sake of a close-up. However, in the context of a half eaten sandwich at a guard post with no sign of the guard, it leaves an air of curiosity. Where did the guard go, why is he gone? Then another notch further, the guard who isn't there is supposed to be defending the Don who was almost gunned down in the streets only a few scenes prior. Now most viewers I would assume have never had armed hit men after them, but the atmosphere that Coppola has painted up to this scene leaves it clear that the men are coming back, and that the only one who can save the Don is the one person who never wanted to get involved in the business, Michael. This is but one example of many in which ordinary things, or the lack there of, create the atmosphere because death lurks around every corner.Beside the fantastic screen-play, and the shot compositions, when one remarks upon The Godfather, they should also mention the musical accompaniment which helps build the scenes like no other. The whole soundtrack is primarily written by Nino Rota with minimal exceptions. The one which most everyone knows is the main theme of The Godfather, \"The Godfather Waltz\" is a very foreboding and slow tune played out on the trumpet for a few moments before being picked up by a few other stringed instruments. Throughout the scenes, the soundtrack might play a more upbeat and serene piece but as soon as you hear that trumpet, all bets are off. It doesn't matter what happened in the scenes prior, somebody is now dancing to The Godfather's tune.Over-all, The Godfather is a wonderful film I would recommend for anyone to watch along with the entire trilogy. It's the type of film that will last from generation to generation as a truly marvel of a film. That, I can guarantee.", "Think.": "Good.\nCombat is a good thing.

It's a movie worth watching and you will never get bored of it I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10 and it is well deserved.Gianni Russo used his organized crime connections to secure the role of Carlo Rizzi, going so far as to get a camera crew to film his own audition and send it to the producers. However, Marlon Brando was initially against having Russo, who had never acted before, in the film. This made Russo furious, and he went to threaten Brando. However, this reckless act proved to be a blessing in disguise, because Brando thought Russo was acting, and was convinced he would be good for the role.", "Italians Lions": "The Italian Lions History.

Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.", "Best in the history.

The balance between the darkness and light, including it in every scene and the way it was used was absolutely class. The way it depicted it the characters, showing the evil that they possess alongside the good, the way that Coppola wanted was done near to perfection. A risk a lot of directors and producers wouldn't have taken due to the movie picture turning out horribly wrong and then having to re-shoot the whole movie again along with added costs. The way that the movie flowed on the screen was done really well. Went at a slightly methodical pace which was pivotal in telling the story. The scene when Vito speaks to the guy in the opening scene to help his daughter is one for the ages and when Michael kills Sollozo and McClusky in the restaurant in New jersey might be one of the best character changes/breakthroughs ever. To be critical as well of the film, even though the general pace of the film was good to tell the story, the wedding scene went on for a bit too long for my liking, but it's understandable as they had too in order to portray the main characters for the story. A lot of movies have this problem for me, it just seems to be a general thing with films. Alongside that, Diane Keaton really didn't to the character of Kay any justice, her acting being as bad as it was, was magnified due to the great performances put in by Brando (Vito), Pacino (Michael Corleone)), Duvall (Tom Hagen), Caan (Sonny Corleone)), Castellano (Clemenza) and Cazale (Fredo Corleone).", "best movie to watch and sleep": "I have watched this movie for 3 times \nevery time I sleep more than the one before \ni rate this movie for 9 \n3 stars for every time i slept in\nif u have some troubles with sleeping \ni suggest that this is the best movie to sleep in", "Exceptional": "The movie was very good and i enjoyed watching it.", "Good for 2020": "This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watch, so I can watch it every year and it gives me new taste everytime.", "World's Dramatic Movie of Time": "I, Ronish Baxter like this movie very much.

It's the per excellence for cinema in terms of narrative, acting, technique, and visibility. Some might argue that it is nor revolutionary, for example, such as The Citizen Cane. I totally agree with that argument that the GodFather I-II is not revolutionary in terms of narrative and form. Yet, but what it perfectly does is to combine all the virtues and improvements of cinematography, and raise them to an advanced level. At its time, it seems it's the end of cinema in terms of perfection. Moreover, it paved the way for the emergence of a new breed of actors such as Robert DE Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Taila Shire, Diane Keaton. It made Robert Duvall a power player in Hollywood Cinema, and gave a legend, Marlon Brando a chance to make an honorable leave that he unfortunately did fail to use. Regarding direction, Coppola set the standards for perfect directing.

They kill because the video games are so violent, they steal because they cannot find a job paying them $30/hour to let them be a slacker, they sexually abuse minors because they are under control of the drug or alcohol, they are fat because the food is too delicious to resist.

No. But it's just old.", "one of my top movie": "I give the godfather 10\\10 it's one of my favorite movie ever", "Great all around film": "One of the greatest all time movies i have ever seen. 10/10 would recommend", "Gute Film": "Excellent and very perfectional\nActors and directors in the best quality / cinema myth", "Under World Movie": "This Movie nice. its open under world man life. \"The Godfather\" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.", "best film ever made": "This is a masterpiece. awesome story , great casting .. must watch!!!!!!", "watch many of the time": "Nice movie i like a lot.................................................................thanks..............................................................................................", "Marlon's Masterpiece": "The film is an amazing achievement in cinema. As far as acting and direction goes it is hard to find a better example. An older Brando plays one of his most famous roles, and possibly his second last great role (after this his last notable film appearance was in 1978's Apocalypse Now). It has an amazing storyline and amazing characters. The supporting cast of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and others make this film one which can never be forgotten or replaced and certainly not replicated. It spawned possibly the most pastiched scene in film and television history (\"One day- and that day may never come- i'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this as a token of my appreciation...\"). It is a must watch film. So buy the collection and watch now!", "godfather/Scarface": "as an Italian American i relate very easily to this movie and i think it portraits Italian culture wonderfully i am just overwhelmed w/amazement and joy this is probably the best movie i have ever seen. The cast of characters is wonderful as well and it is nice to see that most of them are actually Italian themselves. This movie just transcends the test of time and still it is like the movie u think about when you think of the Italian mafia but i cannot decide on 1 thing....scarface or the godfather they both have there places were they are better both of them are old classics any thoughts on this VAFFANCULO!", "The Good Film": "This is the best film action ever guys, do'nt forget to watch this film", "Nice Movie i like And watch": "I like this and watch many time.Beautiful crafted in this movie", "incrivel": "\u00c9 um filme magnifico, melhor que j\u00e1 vi.\n\u00c9 um filme magnifico, melhor que j\u00e1 vi.", "The best movie in the history": "This is the best movie I watched in my life.

He inspired you the respect he inspired\nto the characters of the movie.\nYou really understand how was organised the Italian Mafia in USA during this period, from inside and outside.-The duration of the movie is 3 hours, that can scared you before to see it but the time get fast because of the script which is really well written.I can't recommend this movie in off.", "The Goofather!! Classic movie": "The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them!

Thanks Coppola for this masterpiece of movie.", "The GodFather of Don movies": "Most of the movie addicts would have watched many Don movies, but there is nothing like \"The Godfather\". This is the benchmark movie when it comes to Don movies. Marlon Brando is not just an actor, he is a brand. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this character than Brando. The one punch line \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse\" will explain how beautiful this movie is. The presence of Brando in this movie is just a pleasure to watch. It's just WOW. He is amazing. Not to forget, what Al Pacino provided in this movie is nothing less than Brando. Overall, this is the best Don movie ever made.", "silence": "This is not a movie .This is a part of acculturation .and that beautiful movie songs", "It's a Great Movie": "Director was a great artist.

The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name.\nIt stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.\nParamount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place on location, primarily around New York and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was principally composed by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.\nThe film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made.\nIt won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall (Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola for Best Director.\nThe Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre, It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part 2 (1974) and The Godfather Part 3 (1990).\nI Realy love This Film!", "Still the best movie ive seen": "Still the best movie ive seen, i love this movie and watch 5 more time in 1 year", "AWESOME": "Beautiful.

What I especially enjoy about this film are the dialogs. I believe that the best example of this would be the ever-lasting quote by Don Vito Corleone is \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" Another wonderful thing about this movie is that, despite the Paramount Executives, Al Pacino got the part for Michael Corleone, and ultimately made Pacino famous. The casting was exceedingly good: Bobby Duvall, Jimmy Caan, Talia Shire, Al Pacino, and Marlon Brando.", "Real movie": "Until now, still the best film ever.
