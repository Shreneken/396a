            "content": "5......4.......3.........2.........1......THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO!!!!!And what youngster who didn't recognized the start of the show's theme during the 1960's where the era of James Bond, mini-skirts, and just about every spy show there is to boot?First off,I am a HUGE fan of this show. My parents didn't understand it. My brother didn't care about it. As for me and my cousin who would thumb through the TV section in the local newspaper to see what time it came on....DEFINITELY YES!!!! WE WOULD NEVER MISS IT!!!!During my childhood in the late-1960's and early 1970's,this show would come on every weekday afternoon and mostly Saturday mornings and afternoons as well as me and my cousin would be hooked to the TV set to catch what the Thunderbirds would get into next cause with this show you can expect the unexpected. For some,they may say that this show consisted of models and puppets and geared toward children as it target audience.....and in my book.....THEY WERE WRONG!  THIS SHOW ROCKS!!!!For the 32 episodes that ran during its two seasons(which was showed first in Britain and then on American television on NBC-TV which after it went off the air in 1966,its repeats continue way into 1970 and from there into syndication until for the remainder of the decade until it disappear in oblivion during the 1980's and 1990's)this show was not just your typical kiddie fare material but it was so more much. Where else can you see gorgeous ladies in distress,spectacular machinary that was out of this world and was the best part of the show,amazing spy gadgets and outlandish sets of wonder and magical beyond belief,and not to even mention evil villains set out to take over the world and also spellbinding cliffhanging excitement that left you in total amazement.All presented in brilliant color and Supermarionation!!!!It was no wonder that when the show went off the air in 1966,the crew made their first ever feature length motion picture of the same title which was an international hit. However,the Thunderbird producers Garry and Sylvia Anderson went on to create not just other animated shows,but produced the live-action feature length film \"Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun\"(ITC/Universal,1969)and the series \"Space:1999\"(Syndication, 1975-1978)with former Mission:Impossible stars Barbara Bain and Martin Landau.However after a lengthly absence,The Technology Channel or Tech-TV has brought back all those wonderful memories from the essence of my childhood which are showed Thursday nights. Great series. Don't miss one breathtaking episode!",

            "content": "Thunderbirds was a top Gerry Anderson show right up there with Captain Scarlet and Stingray.Thunderbirds is one of those shows which is enjoyable for so many reasons-the storylines, the action, the characters, the adventures.Thunderbirds was longer than most other Gerry Anderson shows which allowed for better stories and better character development. The show was set around the Tracy Brothers who were behind International Rescue. They had 5 vehicles. Thunderbird 1 was a reconnaissance craft. Thunderbird 2 was a huge plane which could carry all types of equipment. Thunderbird 3 was a space rocket. Thunderbird 4 was a submarine and Thunderbird 5 was a space station. The head of International Rescue was Jeff Tracey. Throughout the series the Tracy boys were aided by Brains who always came up with a solution to problems they encountered. And they also received help from Lady Penelope and Parker as well. The Hood was the evil villain who attempted to steal their secrets but always failed.The puppetry was amazing in this series and the adventures were great. International rescue got involved in all types of situations. My favourite episodes were Cry Wolf where a young lad makes a hoax call to International Rescue and Attack of the Alligators where International Rescue have to rescue some people from giant alligators.This is a timeless classic and if there are any youngsters out there who have not watched it then I urge you to-it really is that good!",

            "content": "Thunderbirds is justly remembered as Gerry Anderson's best series, and its mixture of memorable characters, superb production values, strong scripts, and tense action remains enticing.  The concept of a \"free-lance\" rescue organization using highly advanced machinery for rescues in exceptionally dangerous situations hits home immediately, and the characterization (enhanced by the show's one-hour format) adds enormously to the tension and sympathy within the show's 32 episodes.  Anderson recruited a superior voice cast in Peter Dyneley, Shane Rimmer, David Holliday (who regrettably left the show after its first season), Matt Zimmerman, veteran AP Film voices David Graham and Ray Barrett, Christine Finn, Gerry's then-wife Sylvia, and John Tate.  Though some of the dialogue can be a bit cheesy, it still works, imbuing each character with sympathy and draw.  It all enhances the enjoyably lavish sets, props, and special effects that create the intriuguing mixture of future with circa-1964 present.  Adding a sweep and majesty to the procedings is the score of Barry Gray, using a large orchestra and displaying an often clever grasp of its strength, from the opening teaser and main march openings to each episode through the many incidental cues used, employing multiple instruments down to a solo by banjo or guitar to create the proper atmosphere. \nWhen it all comes to conclusion, the show wins on almost every level, making for an immortal series.",

Personally I don't think this series has dated, the visual set design is great and colourful for its time, and the marionettes and the big machines are incredible. Then there is the music, I love that too. The main theme is rousing and the secondary themes are richly orchestrated and just as exciting. The characters are likable and nimbly voiced, I like how captivating and kitsch Lady Penelope is especially, and the story lines are pretty much outstanding with tense action and maintain my interest. There may be a few slow paced episodes along the way, but I for one love this series. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It warmed my heart to see that he liked it for the same reasons I did. The Thunderbirds is one of several shows done by Gary and Sylvia Anderson. All their shows are the stuff of science fiction legend. These include Stingray, Captain Scarlet, Super car and the Thunderbirds are all puppets shows. The live action shows include the movie \"Journey to the Farside of the Sun,\" the TV shows \"UFO\" and \"Space: 1999\" The style of super cool models for cars, planes, ships and spacecraft are common to all the shows. All the shows had a futuristic late 1960's style. Does any one remember the women with the purple hair in mini-skirts from UFO?",

            "content": "This is perfect entertainment. Everyone can appreciate a good puppet show, and everyone can appreciate a good model; but this show took puppet shows and models to a bold new level of detailing and production complexity. I imagine that on paper it might have looked crazy to some, but believe me, it works. It is indeed, as mentioned in another viewer's comment, like a world of toys come to vibrant life. The making of this show necessitated a fabricated miniature universe. For the premise to work, that world had to be obsessively detailed, with every doorknob, switch, coat button and lock of hair. If the show went to the mountains, they created the mountains. When the ships were in flight, they created the sky. Whatever was needed to pull the story off was built; there was no limit. That these people created a world as believably as they did deserves real praise. \"Thunderbirds\" represented a budgetary step up and a refinement of technique for Gerry Anderson, who for years had worked to perfect an all-puppet TV show that could be taken as serious drama. It was always targeted at kids, but the stories seldom featured child characters, and being a \"rescue show,\" the characters were routinely placed in very threatening predicaments. The effects used to depict scenes of destruction (supervised by Derek Meddings) were often frighteningly realistic. When I saw it as a kid, actually, I had no interest in it, because it seemed dry and \"too adult.\" Seeing it many years later, my reaction was \"Wow! How adult!\"The show is the source of many amusing chuckles today, mainly because its seriousness is absolutely unflinching, despite the fact that the puppets obviously aren't real people. The action was played straight, with appropriate dramatic music cues, and conventional film camera angles and cutting. This all conspired to create a very convincing puppet universe--one that no one would dare attempt today.The recent DVD releases (from A&E) have gone through a digital cleanup process, which has brightened the colors and sharpened the images considerably. The original monaural audio has also been incorporated into a new surround-stereo \"remix\" featuring additional sound effects tracks. The augmented explosions are deafeningly loud at times--which is perhaps as it should be!In a word: Amazing.",

            "content": "When I was a kid I used to get up at 5am to watch this show (pre-video recorder days) with with the volume turned down low so I wouldn't wake my family. Recently, I came across one of the videos in the library and have been slowly rewatching them since. It ain't just nostalgia for my youth motivating me - I still love the models of the planes, spaceships, satelittes, sea ships, nuclear power stations, etc, which are brillantly done. The convincing explosions are still so exciting. The colours are phenomenal - you know that 60's TV colour - pastels and grey and stuff. Plus the jet engine soundtrack and the crazy fashions (those Tracy boys wearing their button down shirts and jackets even though they live on a private island and they complain about it being a warm day). Those jaunty little (impractical) caps. So cool (well the 60s have come back in fashion several times since).Hell, the characters took second fiddle to the machines and the accidents, but there was just enough given away so the audience could extrapolate whatever they liked (like Garbo's face). If you actually watch them all, you're never actually told, say, that John is frustrated that he doesn't go on enough missions, but it is stated as fact in all the books and the websites. Or that Scott is a light sleeper. And sure it is riddled with errors as well - like that they must protect their identities and keep the island base top secret, but Jeff Tracy gives out his name in one episode to the US navy. Well, d'oh! And there is some really stupid technical stuff (same episode where the Empire State building collapses - but it topples over rather than collapses down on itself as we now know skyscrapers do). But aren't all TV shows stupid and simplitic (think Buffy, think Star Trek, think Soapies!).It is so quaint - hey, these days the idea of five men in the early 20s sharing an island with one young woman (Tin Tin), and constantly being involved in dangerous rescues - well, there would be fighting and drugs, nervous breakdowns, sex and rebellion.There is a movie slated for 2004. Hopefully it will update this little pearler of a show, and avoid being the next Lost in Space debacle.",

It did not matter how many times we watched the episodes they remained as fresh as the first viewing. There is a lot of camp humour about the puppets dangling around on their strings but I never noticed that much due to the brilliant idea of never making the characters actually walk. Seriously you watch the TV episodes again you never see anyone put one foot in front of the other. Even the lithe brave Tracys scoot around on little hoverbikes that defy all the laws of physics.All this did not matter I simply adored EVERYthing about the Thunderbirds series. If I was not watching it I was building Thunderbird craft out of LEGO or sawing the crude wheels of the few Thunderbird toys that were available. Then Captain Scarlet came along and shot down the Thunderbirds. That was quite a good series but it never gripped me as much. Then the years rolled by with only TV21 to keep my appetite for the show nourished until even that with its full colour photos from the show came to an end. Reluctantly I had to leave the Tracy's world and return to my own. AND THEN! The entire series was released on DVD. I had to own it! With trepidation I inserted the first disk . Would the show seem childish and crude against my current diet of StarTrek, Starwars and all the others. Not a bit, as soon as that countdown began once again and the screen was rocked by those explosions I had seen so many times before I was hooked ! Again I was amazed at how fresh and alive the episodes are even after all these years. Even the special effects hold their own in our CGI world. Thunderbirds is an absolute classic.

Basically set between the years 2065 to 2067, the story revolves around the adventures of the Tracy family, who have formed secret organisation International Rescue, dedicated to saving human lives around the world. The family are headed by ex-astronaut multi-millionaire philanthropist Jeff Tracy (Peter Dyneley), a widower with five adult children: Scott (Shane Rimmer), Virgil (David Holliday and Jeremy Wilkin), Alan (Matt Zimmerman), Gordon (David Graham), John (Ray Barrett). They reside in a luxurious villa on Tracy Island, their hidden base, along with engineer, scientist and inventor Brains (David Graham), Malaysian manservant Kyrano (David Graham) and his daughter Tin-Tin (Christine Finn), and Grandma Tracy (Christine Finn). Most important to the operation of International Rescue are five machines named the \"Thunderbirds\": hypersonic rocket plane Thunderbird 1, piloted by Scott; supersonic carrier aircraft Thunderbird 2, piloted by Virgil; single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft Thunderbird 3, piloted by Alan; utility submersible Thunderbird 4, piloted by Gordon; and space station Thunderbird 5, which relays the distress signals, manned by John. Disasters that occur around the world include industrial accidents and sabotage, when these distress calls are relayed the appropriate Thunderbird crafts are launched (\"Thunderbirds Are Go!\"). Also integral to the operation are the secret missions carried out by undercover agent Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward (Sylvia Anderson), an English aristocrat, and her butler Aloysius Parker (David Graham), their primary mode of transport is FAB 1, a specially- modified pink Rolls-Royce. To remain a secret organisation, the Thunderbird crafts are equipped with camera detection technology, so they will no be photographed or filmed. The most persistent adversary of the organisation, often trying to get the secrets of the Thunderbirds, the criminal known only as the \"Hood\", a villain operating in a temple in the Malaysian jungle, who possesses hypnotic powers (through his glowing eyes) and black magic, he also has telepathic control over Kyrano, his estranged half-brother. There were 32 episodes of this classic show, the puppet characters are all likable, the stories all have their own charm, the music by Barry Gray is great, and there are plenty of exciting scenes, with explosions, disasters and rescues, and some laughs along the way to keep you watching, it is a most entertaining show for adults and children alike, a great family science-fiction adventure. The episode \"Give or Take a Million\" was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, the programme was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and it was number 60 on The 100 Greatest TV Programmes.

It came on briefly when I was just a kid, but back then, I really didn't appreciate it. My siblings spent most of the time looking for strings and \"real hands\" and not really paying attention to the actual show.When it started on Tech TV, I thought I would give it a whirl, and I found out that I love it.It beats me why Tech TV decided to start showing it. Maybe it is because of the technology shown in the show back then, or the resurgence of popularity in the U.K. Or maybe it's just because of the new movie coming out in 2004. Either way, I am very happy they decided to show it.Although at first glance this show is cheesy and obvious, if you watch it for a while, you find that you start to ignore the wires and mistakes, and begin to really enjoy the show and its plotlines. This show is amazing, and was really breakthrough back then in the 1960's. It is surprising how they used simple kitchen dials and other common objects to create wonderful sets. I like the trivia and comments that Tech TV runs at the bottom, and some of them have caused me to appreciate the show even more. For example, if they didn't explain that each show had to be lengthened from a half-hour to a whole hour, I would have been inclined to complain that they dragged some scenes on too long. I would never have known that they had to lengthen them in order to fit the time period. And I would have never known how much work and cash they put into each show: an astronomical amount for that time period, but it was mostly worth it.I love the 5 Thunderbird vehicles used in the show, and think they did a wonderful job with them. Each one is unique, and is specially suited to its job. The characters are all different as well, not cookie-cutter personalities, and few stereotypes. It was fun to watch the show and see the characters really develop, and also see the vehicles in action.I truly enjoy this show and was disappointed to find out it spanned less than 2 seasons. I think the plot and characters are amazing and I wish I could find the videos online, but no one seems to have them.

There was also 'Thunderbird 5', a space station manned - well - in space - mostly by John which received the distress calls the organisation answered, but Alan and he swapped duty every month. 'Thunderbird 3' was a space ship/rocket.The 'marionation' although a little bit of a laughing stock to today's kids, who are growing up with CGI is still superb in its own right. It's often the butt of jokes with the movements of hands, exclaimation, etc, but it's an endearing mickey-take, not malicious from so many fans.'Thunderbird 1' piloted by Scott (Voiced by the great Shane Rimmer) flew a rocket ship, that had a vertical take off and landing (VTOL) as well, but with swing wings. This is especially a feat of foresight as swing wings were in development in the 'sixties on military 'planes such as the General Dynamics F-111 and the VTOL was in development also.Scott's aircraft had a top speed of 15,000 mph, to enable it to get to a disaster spot quickly, assess the situation and inform the Thunderbirds what equipment was needed to effect the rescue. This was mostly to involve the also excellent 'Thunderbird 2' aircraft, piloted by Virgil though at times, with space-rescue, Thunderbird 3 was the rescuer. Thunderbird 2 was an amazing aircraft and had a portable 'pod' with the rescue equipment needed in it, contained/loaded into its centre section and would fly to the disaster zone at a speed of 5,000 mph. It would then with its hydraulic legs, deploy the pod, and the appropriate 'gear', still often operated by the same crew.Naturally they were to tackle difficult and dangerous situations. One of my favourites and I believe the first episode was an airliner called 'Fireflash', with a bomb on board (Actually in a time when hi-jackings weren't so common) and it had to be brought down without its undercarriage. Thunderbirds deployed three 'hydraulic cars' beneath the wings/body of the aircraft to land it on the runway. It's a fine scene and one the makers should be proud of. Another one, well-handled is where Virgil in'T2' is shot down and crash-lands on the Tracy's Island (See further below).The series also had support from Kirano, the Tracy's loyal servant, his daughter, Tin-Tin, Lady Penelope, a British aristocratic Thunderbirds agent, based in Britain, with her worldwise butler, 'Nosey' Parker. The pair were by no means afraid to help defend the Thunderbirds organisation, which must remain secret. It's this that brings a foil into the fray, against the Thunderbirds. Foreign agents would love to have the plans for the Thunderbird aircraft to use as military applications. A character aptly just named 'The Hood' is tasked by his mentors to infiltrate and deceive the organisation, but the worst of it is, he has a kind of 'telepathic hold' over Kirano (Who is his 'good' brother, it turns out) and literally hypnotises him over the waves. The scenes where he does this are interesting as he leaves Kirano in a painful heap, extracting information out of him. This was a bizarre thing among the plots, but welcome as it added some intrigue. It was actually The Hood who sometimes created potential disasters for the Thunderbirds, for them to turn up to effect rescues just so he could attempt to apply his fiendish plans. There's also the excellent, eccentric 'Brains', the Thunderbirds technical adviser and innovative problem-solver for many rescues.As I've said, the organisation had to remain secret about the family who ran it, and of course this included the base they flew from. This was an idyllic Pacific Island (Tracy Island) where to the untrained eye, the Tracys lived a peaceful existence (Well they actually did when they weren't rescuing!). The Thunderbirds craft were hidden in caves/underground silos (In the case of Thunderbird 1 and 3)and the scenes of their launches are astounding in cinema/TV history alone. 'T1' launched from beneath a large swimming pool, 'T2' from a cave, where the covering of fake palm trees wilted to one side to allow T2 to take its place on the launchpad. Even the lead-ups to the launchpads where the pilots were shown to reach the aircraft were amazing and T2 selected its 'pods'.The series comes back and forth every few years and with it a new wave of enthusiasm. Kids' computer games may play a part in its ratings dropping, as have happened to comics and many toys. An interesting 'not for some' would be that the series wouldn't appear 'politically correct'. The adults in what is supposedly a kids' show (But has more adult fans maybe!) has scenes of casual smoking among anyone including the 'nice' Tracys and a lot of bad guys being foreign. Brains also has a stutter, but he's a respected genius. The questions you always ask yourselves is how can they afford to run and maintain the fleet, financially and physically. In one episode mention was made of the fact they had ordered aircraft parts and put them together in their own fashion to repair a Thunderbirds aircraft. But to ask these questions means you wouldn't have a series as good as this! Favourite tools of the Thunderbirds? It has to be 'The mole' for me! It also had a fine score, incidental as well, by the great John Barry, who also composed for the likes of the 'James Bond' films and 'Zulu'.",

Though barely in kindergarten, I would sit through each entire 1-hour episode, even if I had seen them before.  The amazing machines, the fascinating storylines, the cool explosions--everything was enjoyable and exciting for the entire family.  Even my teenaged sister would drop everything to watch it. Fast foward nearly 40 years--now on DVD (so the puppet strings are very visible), my 11-year old and 4-year old sons will sit and watch each episode (now sans commercials) beginning to end.  No matter that the special effects are not like Star Wars or Star Trek--the stories still capture and hold the entire family's attention.  Great entertainment for the entire family!  (And yes, I still watch them with the kids!)",

With that in mind come five experienced young men flying around the globe to aid humanity. Filmed with puppets and miniature sets and effects, rocket flight never looked so good.Yes, as it is nearly fifty years since this groundbreaking television series aired, there are some funny incidental goofs. The fashion in the characters clothes have dated, strings are seen controlling the puppets, the dialogue can be cheesy and the miniature sets sometimes look... well, miniature. But get by that and sink into this amazing world.Each episode is well filmed, the special effects are still good to look at, thrilling action and the stories are sharp and entertaining. Each fifty minute episode is better than a Hollywood sci-fi flick today (Armageddon). And because this is a family show you would expect great humour... but believe it or not, Thunderbirds is mainly humourless. Something that might put viewers off today.So sit back and watch this clever, nostalgic science fiction show where puppets save the world.",

The model work is so good it's impossible for most of us to even figure out how big the puppets were. This is a timeless classic, no doubt as intended to be all along. But I have to confess this TV show blew my 5 year old mind when it came on. I literally couldn't figure out if the puppets were real people, even with the obvious strings moving them about... I think i was too bashful to ask my parents about this but I distinctly remember a lot of confusion while watching this since the puppets seemed pretty real (consider the rock-bottom quality of the rest of children's programming then and the general lack of good special effects - a lot of TV was pretty cut-rate, cheap productions. And along comes these, really very life-like puppets...I think it might be fun to prank the kids with this show, honestly.)If you get a chance to watch an episode of \"Thunderbirds\", you might want to have a look (although \"Team America\" captures the puppet work perfectly, without taking itself quite so seriously).",
