            "review_title": "Growing Up In The Bronx",
            "content": "A Bronx Tale does take me back to New York City in the sixties. I grew up in Brooklyn then which certainly has always had its own identity. I'm glad that Chazz Palmentiri has given the Bronx an identity of its own. There are still parts of the Bronx which have the Italian neighborhood you see depicted here. But the Bronx is a Latino majority borough now, ironic when you consider part of the story of A Bronx Tale is the racial tension between the blacks and Italians.The movie divides in two parts, the first is around 1960 with the background of the 1960 World Series, one of the best ever played where the Yankees of Mickey Mantle lost to the Pirates in seven games. Robert DeNiro is your average Joe, a bus driver by profession trying with his wife, Katherine Narducci, to raise their son who is eight years old. Young Francis Capra who is fascinated by the gangsters hanging out at the bar down the street, witnesses the local boss commit a murder. True to the neighborhood code he doesn't snitch to the police and the local boss takes him under his wing.Chazz Palmentiri is the boss and he's an interesting character. A man who's risen to the top of his profession, he's got a sense of himself and what it took to get there. Life is about choices, he made his and he's going with the flow, but he knows it isn't for everyone. He advises young Capra to stay in school, but the more he advises the more fascinating Palmentiri becomes to DeNiro's dismay.The second half of the story is in 1968, the Bronx as part of America ravaged by racial tensions, assassinations and the war in Vietnam. The little boy is now teenager Lillo Brancato who gets interested in a black girl, a big no-no in the crowd he comes from, but Palmentiri is the one person who encourages the relationship. Let's just say that everything, every element of the story comes full circle on one night in the Bronx in 1968.The comparison to Goodfellas for me is obvious. The two kids who grow up to be Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are taken under the wing of neighborhood boss Paul Sorvino who sees them as promising gangster material and they grow into the roles. Palmentiri keeps telling the young kid here do what I say not what I do, but in the end it takes some tragic events to set him on a right path.DeNiro who you would normally expect in the gangster role is just fine as the father, a good man, not a perfect one by any means, but just a guy trying to do right by his family. It's Palmentiri however who really steals the film as the local gangster boss who's as street smart as they come, but even with all that can't anticipate all contingencies.Lillo Brancato who went on to several other film roles and a long running one in The Sopranos certainly in real life didn't make the same choices as his character Calogero Anello did. Life really imitated art in his life story.Nice to see the Bronx get its due.",

            "review_title": "If Bobby and Chazz are reading this...I couldn't thank you more!!!",
            "content": "This might be a matter of taste, but \"A Bronx Tale\" remains Number 2 on list of Favorite Movies of All Time.  It just happens to be one of the most deeply moving, powerful films I've ever encountered.  Yes, some may consider this a simple story, but that's the beauty of it.  It's a down-to-earth, coming-of-age story that perfectly mirrors the life of a boy like C growing up in the Bronx at such a hectic time.  Of course, this is based on Chazz Palminteri's real life experiences, and I envy Chazz, being an aspiring screenwriter/director.  I wish I had life experiences like that to put on film.  And I have to commend my man Bobby D for bringing these images to life in such a vibrant, engrossing way.DeNiro captures every element of the 1960's Bronx, with a great opening sequence featuring doo-wop singers sweetly singing the movie's theme.  He captures so many elements of the period, and it was nice to see only one goof was captured.  It was interesting to find out that most of the movie was actually shot in Brooklyn--my hometown.  Then again, the two places are alike in their own simple ways.  Bobby D has a short, but memorable role (which is against type) as a working-class bus driver.  He's desperately trying to get by and support his son, Cologero (I think that's how to spell it...LOL), and disapproves of his son's new \"job\" with gangster Sonny (Chazz, who gives a landmark performance).  The interactions between DeNiro and his son are extraordinary in the way they mirror the way a real father and son would argue in those situations.  As I said, it's the whole down-to-earth quality of this movie that I think made it tick.  It's nothing pretentious.  This is a simple movie about humanity.  The gangster plot is merely a backdrop. \nThe only other movie I've seen him in was \"Crimson Tide\" in a very small role, but Lillo Brancato (who plays DeNiro's son in the later years) is a revalation!  He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in any more recent movies.  And I have to say DeNiro did a dynamic job of casting.  As far as I know, Brancato and Bobby aren't related, but please tell me if I'm wrong, because they look EXACTLY alike!  If you've seen any of DeNiro's very early films, Brancato is a mirror image of him.  Is it coincidence or what?  I've rarely seen a film where the son/daughter even directly resembles the parents, but Brancato has the DeNiro nose and everything.  If you observe closely, there's a scene where Brancato is wearing a black jacket and a black hat, and if you were to see this in a split-screen with DeNiro in \"Mean Streets\" it would be uncanny.  There are so many people I have to commend for this film.  That also includes the supporting cast.  Taral Hicks as C's love interest was also impressive.  And of course, you can't have a movie directed by DeNiro and starring DeNiro without his main amigo making an appearance.  Hopefully, you haven't read the cast list on the IMDB.  Because I was surprised and overjoyed when \"the man\" appeared in the final scene. \nThere are many lessons on life to be drawn out of this film, some of which given by Chazz's character Sonny, who plays the most likeable gangster I've seen in cinema.  Yet at the same time, you can't consider him \"too nice.\" Which was a good move.  Sonny was a nice guy in the core, yet he still has a heart of a gangster.  In a great monologue, he explains how he'd rather be feared than loved.  And of course there's the great monlogue that everyone remembers:  the car door scene.  That was really an unforgettable speech. Plus, there's funny moments, too.  The gambling scene in the basement, for example.  \"Get in the f**king bathroom!!!\"  LOL...that was hilarious. \nTo add to the emotional intensity, we have an interracial relationship between Brancato and Hicks at a time when Bronx was heavily segregated and whites wanted absolutely nothing to do with blacks.  The scene where the boys beat those innocent black boys down was an extremely powerful scene. And through DeNiro's direction, we feel the characters' every emotion.  I like how he used the doo-wop music to contribute to the soundtrack.By the end, I was almost at tears.  I'm virtually tearing up just writing this review and looking at this masterful drama in retrospect.  This is something ONLY Bobby D and Chazz could've done!  No one could've done it better!  For me to be this deeply moved by a motion picture is unprecedented.  I wish I could be thanking the two guys in person.If anyone hasn't seen this movie, please don't hesitate to pick it up!  This is one of those great, underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success.  A film like this really deserves more recognition.And Bobby D....I think you owe a bunch of \"thank yous\" to your buddy Scorcese.  He's taught you well.My score:  A perfect 10! (out of 10)",

            "review_title": "Vintage Robert DeNiro",
            "content": "The amount of brillance that Robert DeNiro puts into all of his performances is unmatched and he proves that he can also be a fine director by debuting in that field as well as starring in this 1993 Savoy release. DeNiro is top billed but you actually don't see very much of him. The film's major focus is that of a little boy named Calogero and his idol, a mobster named Sonny (Chazz Palminteri). Sonny owns the Bronx neighborhood where Calogero and his honest bus driver father Lorenzo (DeNiro) live. He also basically owns them. Sonny's heavy amount of power and wealth make him an intimidating force throughout the neighborhood but his mob gang make their fear of him look like complete respect. Sonny knows that he's feared and it just encourages him to keep trying to rise in power. Calogero grows up watching Sonny cavorting on the street with his gang and secretly imitating him much to Lorenzo's chagrin. Lorenzo wants the best life possible for Calogero and doesn't want to see him fall into a life of crime or looking up to crime figures. Calogero doesn't listen because he idolizes Sonny too much and his chance to get Sonny's attention comes when he witnesses Sonny fatally shoot a man. When Calogero is questioned by police, his loyalty comes before his conscience and he doesn't rat out Sonny's guilt in the shooting. Sonny strongly appreciates this and so he gives Calogero an easy money job serving drinks for his high rollers gang. As several years pass and Calogero nears the end of his childhood, he must learn to make the ultimate choice between his two \"father\" figures. Just like in \"Goodfellas\", a classic soundtrack and excellent period detail is evident here and this film stands out as yet another classic in the modern day organized crime film genre. Palminteri makes a strong film starring debut and DeNiro makes the very most of his rather small seeming part. Joe Pesci also appears briefly as another respected crime boss. An instant \"new classic.\"",

            "content": "I have seen this movie over & over like many of the people who have reviewed it. It's true that this is loosely based on the life of Chazz (C) Palmenteri who wrote the screenplay. Word is that when he was looking to make the play into a movie, he had only one condition, that he play the part of Sonny. He was rejected several times until he found Robert DeNiro & Tribeca productions. What luck for all of us too! Chazz was born to play the role of Sonny & how refreshing to see DeNiro as the humble and hardworking father figure instead of the gangster that he has so often played.This movie has heart & a story that is actually appropriate for young adults. Despite the language & moderate violence (such as the bar scene) there isn't anything graphic (certainly not on the scale of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan!) and no nudity, just a good story. One of the gems is that nothing is sadder than wasted talent. Thank God that Mr. Palmenteri didn't waste his and shared this wonderful story with all of us. Unforgettable movie, a definite 10 out of 10!",

            "review_title": "Wonderful coming-of-age story in little Italy",
            "content": "Oh, what a wonderfully small and intricate film this is!  How I love and cherish the world I am pulled into every time I see this film.  Robert De Niro's directorial debut proves strong and lively, evidenced by how he stuck to a topic close to home; a young, impressionable Italian kid growing up little Italy in the late 60's.  As the naive protagonist Calogero, or 'C' as he is nicknamed, Lillo Brancato gives a great performance as a young man torn between the working-class honesty displayed by his strict father and the ruthless world of organized crime demonstrated by the neighborhood crime boss Sonny (Chazz Palminteri adapted his own play and cast himself as a burly, laid back, world weary know-it-all).One key element that snags you in is the narration.  Like equally personal films of its stature (Scorsese's gangster trilogy, \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Election,\" \"Bringing Out The Dead\", \"SLC Punk!\"), the voice-over guiding brings you in even further into the already detailed landscape and story presented. I don't really consider this a mafia movie, it's much more of a coming-of-age tale.  However, the background De Niro provides is so intimate and thorough that you wish for another film chronicling the life of Sonny.I have to admit that, for a debut, De Niro's judicious use of music seemed to rival that of Spike or Scorsese in turns of effectiveness.  First of all, De Niro kept a much more grass roots approach, sticking to doo-wop, soul, rock, \"mobster pop\" (Dean or Frank) and a little jazz.  Whereas Scorsese will use anything at his disposal (\"Casino\" had two Devo tunes in it), De Niro really seems to search for what really makes the scene.  My favorite is the scoring of a street fight scene to \"Nights In White Satin\"... De Niro must of knew before we did it was all in the violins.  De Niro said he knew this type of story had been done before and didn't want to repeat anything, so he viewed Scorsese's mobster trilogy to see what already had been done. It's obvious he paid attention.Even De Niro himself knows a little Italy gangster film is not complete with at least a surprise-ending cameo from you know who...",

Chazz is a genius who can write for the theater, the film and play the starring role.  He is the modern personification of charisma. De Niro plays one of his most engaging and lovable roles. This, my friends, is movie making. No blue screens, no CGI, nothing but a wonderful story, brought to life, as movies were meant to be. Oh yes, the ending is perfect. Being a fellow filmmaker, I can't help but be a little envious at De Niro's first directing job.  Directing is hard work, acting is hard work, to act in your first directing effort is...incredible. Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Look at the kind of actor he is.  Great film, don't miss it, but please don't wait for the special effects. This is one film that doesn't need them to captivate you. 10/10",

            "content": "A BRONX TALE is a gangster story set in New York of the 1960s, produced and directed by Robert De Niro and adapted from a play by co-star Chazz Palmentiri. It's a film I'd vaguely heard of but never actually watched until now, despite being a massive fan - as are most people - of the gangster collaborations between Martin Scorsese and De Niro. It's a shame that this film is forgotten in comparison to GOODFELLAS and CASINO, because it's very nearly on the same level as those classics. It boasts excellent photography throughout, a great recreation of the era, a wonderful soundtrack, and superb, multi-layered performances from the entire cast. De Niro excels as a straight guy for once but this is Palmentiri's film and he runs away with it. The story is both moving and sensitive, a forthright coming-of-age drama with a few moments of violence, but at its heart this is about father/son relationships and the trials of growing up and doing the right thing. Excellent stuff.",

            "content": "Robert De Niro's directorial debut is a criminally underappreciated piece of cinema. A Bronx Tale may not contain the same depth, intricacy and intensity of The Godfather or Goodfellas, but it can certainly be considered one of the finest gangster movies of the 20th century.Unlike many other films in this genre which focus on the wider power dynamics within the mafia, A Bronx Tale tells its story mainly through personal relationships. There is a particular focus on Calogero's struggle to please his loving father while being constantly seduced by the alluring Sonny and the associated gang lifestyle. Lillo Broncato is warm and likeable in the lead role and has a remarkably authentic on-screen relationship with De Niro, which is enhanced by the strong physical resemblance between the two. The accomplished Chazz Palminteri shines as Sonny, turning in an understated performance with a delicacy often missing from these kind of characters.And then there is the music. As a lifelong fan I am probably a little bit biased, but its hard to describe how much I love this soundtrack, particularly The Complexions version of 'I Only Have Eyes For You'. The sidewalk acapella groups crooning under the streetlights make me nostalgic about memories I don't even have.There isn't much to dislike about this film. Joe Pesci's late cameo is unnecessary and a little glib, and the biker gang that get beat up in the bar are almost like slapstick characters. Aside from that, this is a truly magnificent film that has never received the recognition it deserves.",

            "review_title": "Interesting Portrait With A Killer 'Hero'",
            "content": "Here is a realistic-looking and an involving story of the street life in New York City's Bronx section in the 1950s and 1960s. Excellent acting and a good job of re-creating the era and site's atmosphere are main things going for this film. Also the soundtrack is very, very good. The main problem I have with the film is the fact that a cold-blooded killer is made to be the hero - a guy that you root for! Unbelievable. Playing that killer is Chazz Palminteri, who outperforms the more famous and great actor and co-star Robert De Niro. Actually, the co-star is Lilo Brancoto, who was recently in the news for allegedly committing a major crime himself.Anyway, supposedly this is Palminteri's story of his childhood and features him as a young boy and then as a 17-year-old. He has a straight father (De Niro) but looks up to the area's Mafia leader \"Sonny\" (Palminteri), who takes the kid under his wing for not ratting on him when he witnessed him killing someone.It may have a bad message, and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way, but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours. It was good to see De Niro play the honest, hard-working bus driver who wants his kid to have character and not emulate the local hoods.This is a not a movie for those who wince at the f-word because it's used frequently. This is more of man's movie, really, with males dominating and some good advice on dating and what to look for in women! \"Sonny,\" despite being a killer, is shown to be a caring, compassionate guy who cares about young \"Calogero\" (Brancoto, and earlier as a 9-year-old played by Francis Capra).There are so many mixed messages in here - good and bad - it would make your head swim, but it is a crime film very much worth investigating.",

Robert De Niro, in his directorial debut, shows an inside view of the mafia in the neighborhood and how an individual child idolize them just like the way the film GoodFellas showed how a kid wanted to be a gangster. Chazz Palminteri plays Sonny, the kingpin in the neighborhood, who is not only a feared man in the Bronx but also kills a man in the streets and Lorenzo's (Robert De Niro) son, Colgero, is the witness. Lorenzo's son doesn't rat on anybody and Sonny considers the kid an okay person where he'll take care of him like a father would for his son if he does certain favors that would make Lorenzo uncomfortable.Colgero sees different point of views from his two \"fathers\" where Lorenzo, his real father, is an honest bus driver who likes what he does in making a living prior to standing by in his codes of morality while Colgero sees Sonny as something of a hero since he's not a sucker like those who have to wait for bum paychecks where all he does is make a living by either killing or stealing where having power makes a man.As Colgero grows into a teenager in the 60's, both his real father (Lorenzo) and his idol (Sonny) want the best for him with different standards and don't want to see him in the wrong direction. At the same time Colgero falls in love with a woman, a young black girl, at his high school where interracial relationships is consider a no-no to both the black community and the Italian neighborhood. It doesn't bother Colgero one bit while asking both his father and idol for advice where he's growing up to be a man.\"A Bronx Tale\" is not only a life lesson movie, but a coming of age story where not only does Colgero witness everything in front of him from death to prejudice but it's about how two men from separate worlds want the best for this kid.",

Faced with racism and a crime-based community, learns his own morals from a strand of tough events.This is not the first movie I have ever seen to make the gangster out to be a some what nice guy. But this is the first one I have seen to actually make him somewhat of a saint. Sonny(Palminteri) is the example of a split personality with a criminal. He is very tough with a community that he loves and basically runs but is also very protective and guiding to many people. I found this to be quite interesting in this type of genre.Robert De Niro's character on the other hand, is very bold. He plays the father who is concerned with his son's well being and is just your normal flat character. He was unimpressive, but effective for a movie that was by no means perfect in the first place.The idea of this movie was what made it so intriguing. At two hours long, it consists of a large epic story of a young man trying to make it through a part of New York. Some important events were perhaps too close together but it was still entertaining and quite moving.

They loved it, and so did I, more than ever. My rating went from a 9 to a 10.It is a remarkable directorial debut for Robert De Niro, who told writer Chazz Palminteri that he would make it \"f'n great.\" Understandably, Palminteri said he would not change a thing about it. The soundtrack selected by De Niro really helps set the scene for this solid period piece depicting The Bronx in the civil rights era. The film looks great, with excellent cinematography courtesy of Reynaldo Villalobos. A first film for many concerned; it is another example of ideal casting.A Bronx Tale deals with how one is shaped by their upbringing and environment. Lillo Brancato's Calogero is uniquely advantaged by having strong parenting (De Niro) and a positive friendship with the local mob boss (Palminteri), but nevertheless, peer pressure pulls him into a vortex of destructive negativity, and removing himself from it is easier said than done.",

            "content": "A Bronx Tale (1993) **** (out of 4)Magnificent story about a young man (Lillo Brancato) growing up in the Bronx and being confused about life as most kids are. Growing up he had his hard working father (Robert DeNiro) preaching about keeping a clean life while he also got advice from a wise guy (Chazz Palminteri) from the neighborhood.A BRONX TALE is without question one of the greatest films of the decade and I think it also contains one of the greatest screenplays ever written. I remember when the film was released it got a lot of very good reviews but several people claimed that it didn't stack up to the type of films that influenced it. Of course, with DeNiro directing it a lot of people compared it to the work of Scorsese and I think that's unfair because this wasn't meant to be a Scorsese film. There are obviously influences here but I think this film holds up very well on its own and its message of morals and consequences is something very few films has mastered like this one.I will openly say that this is a film that I really love because the set-up is just so perfect. You've got a middle class father who has a set of morals that has him hating the gangster who has attached himself to his son. You've got a gangster with a different set of morals who believes that working people are stiffs. Both men have their own set of rules and they both love this young kid and want to see him succeed even if their advice often isn't something the other agrees with. The screenplay by Palminteri is perfect in so many ways as it really is a great coming-of-age story and it also has some terrific life lessons. I was thirteen when I first watched this movie and its message hit me then and it hits me even harder today now that I have my own kids.The setting is really remarkable and I think DeNiro did a terrific job at capturing an era that he grew up in. Obviously he knew a lot about it and it translates perfectly to the screen. The music selections, something I'm going to guess was inspired by Scorsese, are also wonderfully done. The film has a very good flow to it and I thought the director did an excellent job at keeping the film moving. He certainly helps bring these characters off the page and we're given some very memorable and powerful scenes. One of the strongest is the first time the father confronts the gangster.The performances are certainly terrific with Palminteri stealing the film as the wise gangster. I really thought the actor did a remarkable job with the part and especially the laid back approach. Brancato is also extremely good as the older kid and Francis Capra also deserves credit playing the younger kid. Then there's DeNiro who is usually playing the gangsters but here he's given the role of the father. It's pretty much a supporting part but the actor turns in another terrific performance and there's a lot of heart in the part.A BRONX TALE works on so many levels and it's really too bad so many people has overlooked the film. Those who know the film love it and I think if more people would give it a shot even more would love it.",

            "review_title": "Entertaining Effort From Robert De Niro",
            "content": "For much of \"A Bronx Tale\", first-time director Robert De Niro seems to be aping his friend/collaborator Martin Scorsese's directorial style, with the period soundtrack and gritty depiction of the mean streets of New York City. But \"A Bronx Tale\" is more than that. It isn't as flashy as \"Goodfellas\" or \"Casino\", but is indeed a rather realistic and true picture. While not a great film, \"A Bronx Tale\" is still a worthwhile effort from De Niro.The plot involves Calergo \"C\" Anello (Francis Capra/Lillo Brancato), the son of an Italian bus driver, Lorenzo (De Niro), who grows up in the mean streets of the Bronx in the 1960s, when blacks are moving into the neighborhood, causing inevitable ethnic tension with its primarily Italian residents. Anello finds himself being (metaphorically) seduced by Sonny (Chazz Palmenteri, who co-wrote the movie based on his own experiences), a big shot gangster who seems to represent a glorious, exciting way of life. After \"C\" watches Anello shoot a man to death but refuses to identify Sonny as the killer, he becomes sort of a gofer for the gang, a la Henry Hill in \"Goodfellas\". Eventually, Sonny and Lorenzo come to blows over C's future, while C falls in love with a black girl (Taral Hicks), which doesn't square well with the activities of his bigoted friends.The plot may seem a bit cluttered written down, but it all flows together really well. The movie does play sort of like \"Goodfellas\"-lite, and one can't help but think that De Niro is trying to replicate Scorsese's directorial style. The racial angle, which may sound a bit out of place in a gangster flick, is worked into the main plot very well. The movie contains some powerfully directed scenes - particularly the unforgettable (in the worst way) sequence where C's friends attack a group of helpless black bikers whose only crime is riding through the Italian section of town.The acting is very good, though that's to be expected. De Niro gives a very understated performance as Lorenzo, a working class guy who honestly believes that it's better to be a hard-working nobody than a successful gangster. However, kudos to Chazz Palmenteri for making his Sonny a likable character who, while a gangster, tries his hardest to keep C from getting into serious trouble or even into the gang. Most writers/directors would've made Sonny a violent psychotic and put him into a good-versus-evil tug-of-war with Lorenzo over Calergo's soul, but Sonny is a genuinely nice guy (though a bit rough around the edges) and Palmenteri delivers a knock-out performance. Capra and Brancanto both do nice work as well. The rest of the cast is mostly a group of relative unknowns, though De Niro regulars Joe Pesci and Clem Caserta pop up briefly, but their performances - particularly Hicks as Calergo's love interest - are still solid.Overall, \"A Bronx Tale\" is not a great or classic film, but it's memorable in its own right and does a great job of delivering its message of right-versus-wrong, racial discrimination, and the daily life on the streets. Don't expect a \"Godfather\"-caliber film, but if you want a well-made and entertaining gangster pic, by the greatest gangster actor of all time (albeit playing a non-gangster), than take a chance with this film. You probably won't be disappointed. 7/10",

Being based on facts , in fact starring is really a teen and a mobster , dealing with a coming-of-age story . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay , being adapted from the play written by Chazz Palminteri, whose real name is Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri. In fact , it is adapted from his autobiographical one-man play. As Palminteri was involved in every aspect of writing , casting , scouting locations, editing, music and general production. De Niro approached him to purchase the film rights , then Palminteri agreed with him to go into a fifty/fifty partnership, and a series of conditions , as long as De Niro could direct and play Lorenzo .

Calogero's father, Lorenzo, wants to have nothing to do with the mob and does his best to keep his son away from Sonny and mob business. However, it may prove a losing battle...Good, but not great. Written by Chazz Palminteri and directed by Robert De Niro (and starring the two of them), the movie had heaps of potential: a gangster story that revolves around how a kid gets sucked into the world of the mob and how this affects him and the people around him. However, while reasonably engaging and entertaining, the movie doesn't quite live up to its potential.The main problem is the script. The main plot is fine, it's the sub-plots and scene-to-scene development that sometimes don't work, feeling at times clumsy and contrived. There's also an idealism and preachiness that start to grate after a while. The conclusion is okay, but is not as profound as it takes itself.Robert De Niro, in his directorial debut, does okay behind the camera, though the editing does feel choppy at times.

            "content": "There has never been any doubt that Robert De Niro can act rings around just about any actor today but it came as a surprise that he is also a director of some skill. It is clear, who he has drawn a lot of inspiration from, but unlike Scorsese his film \"A Bronx Tale\" is a quiet character study where the violence doesn't hit you over the head.Chazz Palminteri, who plays the local mob boss, Sonny, wrote a play about his childhood and De Niro read it. He then met with Palminteri and said (this is how Palminteri himself described it on the AFI Awards show for De Niro): \"You can get anybody to make this movie but if I'll make it f***ing right!\" Boy, was he right. The director could have made this into a clich\u00e9d gang flick but De Niro made it with heart and wit.De Niro also plays the father, Lorenzo, and his son Calogero (based on Palminteri) is played by Francis Capra as a child and Lillo Brancato as a teen. The latter was a real find. He actually looks like De Niro and he can act too. The way the relationships between Lorenzo, Sonny and Calogero are portrayed is the best parts of this movie. You can actually buy that Sonny could get a boys respect and still maintain his feared image and you can also buy that Lorenzo does make sense most of the time but that it is the boy who teaches the father a lesson at the end, to respect another person even though he does not fulfill your perception of a model citizen.The things I have just written maybe sound a bit hard to swallow but it shouldn't turn you off seeing the movie because it is the most accomplished piece of work by a first time director that I have ever seen and I hope De Niro will make another stab at directing soon. Lately, he doesn't seem to have that much interest in making anything other than comedies and that's okay but he should consider making at least one film more that you can relate to like this one certainly did to me.",

            "content": "It's sad to hear about what truly happen to the actor that plays Robert De Niro's son in Bronx Tale. Lillo Brancato, Jr. was a gifted actor, but on December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York in which an off-duty police officer confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's like he never learn anything from the movie, he started in. A Bronx Tale is an American crime drama film set in the Bronx during the turbulent era of the 1960s. It was the directorial debut of Robert De Niro that follows a young Italian-American teenager Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato) as his cross paths with guided by two father figures, played by De Niro as Lorenzo Anello and Chazz Palminteri as Sonny LoSpecchio to try to get him out of a life of crime. It was written by Palminteri, based partially upon his childhood and throughout the film, they were some very good written lines by Chazz. I like Sonny's speech about the car lock test. Palminteri also wrote some very interesting funny side-character such as Tony Toupee, Eddie Mush, Joey Whispers, and Frankie Coffeecake. There was a funny running gag throughout the film, of Eddie Mush jinxing everybody from winning a lot of money in gambling. I love how Palminteri tackle the race conflict of the 1960s, and it's nice to see a movie that has an interracial love interest. It's rare to see that in movies, even today. The only thing, I didn't like about Paliminteri's story is the stop snitching or anti-being a rat. I felt that as a let-down in the right teaching. Palminteri adapted the screenplay from his one-man show of the same name. Palminteri would not sell the rights to his story unless he could write the screenplay and was guaranteed the role of 'The gangster' Sonny. Paliminteri was perfect for the role as Sonny as the man you have to fear, but also loved. Thank God, De Niro saw the show and approached Palminteri to direct it because you can tell Robert De Niro does a great job on the film. The way, he use the camera in close ups, wide shots, and use props in this period piece was amazing. The best example of his film making, is how he use film to show Sonny talking to Calogero while also driving backwards in his car. That scene only is amazing. Robert De Niro choice's of music really show heart and sets the mood of the 1960's. Robert De Niro really did a great job in picking Lillo Brancato as his teenager's son. I honest can't believe how much they look like each other. In the scene where Calogero is hanging out with his friends. They had one of his friends look and act like a young Tommy DeVito to the point that they remind me of the teenager's version of the Goodfellas trio. The faults of the movie are these. First off, the movie isn't an action film, nor an ultra-gangster film as portray in the movie's poster and cover. It's a coming to age story. People that was looking forward to seeing this as a violent gangster movie will be mistaken and disappointed. It's not Carlito's Way or Scarface type of a movie will. There is barely any violence until the third act. Most of the time, it's scene of the child getting advice and spending time with his dad or with Sonny. The acting were mostly great, but the actress playing Calogero's love interest Jane Williams is a bit wooden. Taral Hicks can't act in this film. She looks like she asking the camera for her lines and about to crack up. The whole scene where they were walking home was a trash-wreck. It felt awkward. Also the mother of Calogero seems to disappear from the film, nor playing much in the second or third act. Rosina (Katherine Narducci) was just annoying and most of the female leads were. The third act was a bit rush as too much was going on, on scene. I don't know they never used Pesci throughout the film rather than the one small cameo scene at the end. It's still a mystery to me. I have to say if Robert De Niro made more film like this, directing. He would be as good/better than other actors turn directors such as Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Ron Howard. He is able to finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values, and having values is the best thing to have in life.",

This coming-of-age story about a young Italian boy growing up in the heart of Little Italy in The Bronx in the 1960's is Robert DeNiro's directorial debut, and it's an auspicious one. Everything about the story rings true; the neighborhood, the mobsters, his family and friends, the gambling; all of it. I visited 187th Street in the Bronx just 2\u00bd months ago, and I could easily imagine everything happening there, even though the bulk of the movie was filmed in Astoria, Queens. I also saw the Broadway play starring Chazz Palmintieri less than 4 weeks ago.The principal character is a young boy named Calagero, and the movie is the story of how his life was molded by his experiences growing up in the neighborhood. Through a serendipitous event, he is befriended by a neighborhood mobster, Sonny, who takes him under his wing. His hard-working bus-driver father opposes the relationship and confronts the gangster at one point. But Calagero's friendship with the gangster continues to flourish through his teen years. As he reaches his mid-teens in the late 60's, his racist friends lean towards troubles beyond the usual teenage rowdiness and try to drag Calagero with them. A large subplot is the interracial romance he pursues with a girl from school. It seems doomed from the outset, due to pressures from all their friends and families, and society itself. Everyone except Sonny.It took me a few months to fully appreciate this movie. Everything about it is so *honest*. It is at times, happy, sad, funny, crazy, romantic, terrifying and nostalgic. I won't reveal the dramatic ending, but I will spill one bean. The author of this semi-autobiographical story is also named Calagero, but he's better known as 'Chazz' Palmintieri, who is also the star. It rates as one of the better movies I've ever seen.

Unfortunately, somewhere around the middle point, I lost interest in it. I don't know if I just thought there were far too many characters to keep track of, if it took too long for it to take off or if it simply went too slow altogether... but I didn't pay much attention to the last half of the movie. The film is independent, and it shows. No big-budget stuff, but just sufficiently high production value to keep you watching. The plot is pretty good, and very well-written. I must admit, the film kept surprising me, even though it was somewhat clich\u00e9d and by-the-numbers. The pacing starts out fine, but it fails about half-way through. The acting is good, pretty much all-round, though a few actors(most noticeably, Lillo Brancato) are bad. The dialog is fairly well-written, with a few very quotable lines. Good film with a good message, but you can tell that it's a first time direction effort.

However this manages to be much more than just him copying Scorsese instead he sets a coming of age tale in this environment so that it is not just a tale of crime (although that is part of it).The tale is more of C being  split between the two men who he looks up to for different ways and deciding between their lives.  It also ropes in racism and almost manages to deal with it quite well.The direction is good and he has taken the use of music from Scorsese and used it well.  The script is good and feels like it has meaning to De Niro, even if it was written by Palminteri!  I felt it did slightly waver when it started to drag in racism etc and C dating a black girl \u0096 but the central theme of C split between the two role models kept everything strong.De Niro is very good as always and I think it was brave of him to accept the less showy role.  Palminteri also does well and doesn't let his gangster become a monster, instead he is a nice guy.  Brancato is very good and has plenty of wieght on his shoulders.  The only weak link was some of Hicks' stuff \u0096 at times she didn't sound as immersed in her character as some of the others.  De Niro also knows that the difference between a good gangster film and a great one can often be Joe Pesci \u0096 and manages to get him a good cameo at the end.Overall I approached this expecting a Scorsese-clone and on the surface I thought that's what I had.  However De Niro and Palminteri as director and writer deliver a much better film than just some nasty Goodfellas clone.",

It's nice to see Robert De Niro starring in a gangster movie without being one of the gangsters himself. The movie is cool, emotional and has a deeper morally message at the same time which is why the movie is still printed in my mind today, two years since I saw it the last time. a one of a kind movie which I will not hesitate to salute with a maximum score of 10!

            "content": "I am a lifetime fan of the gangster genre' and there are very few titles I have not yet seen, but if I could only own one gangster movie without doubt, that title would have to be \"A Bronx Tale\". A Bronx Tale is sheer genius screen writing by Chazz Palminteri, who also plays one of the three starring roles in the movie, and it is based on Chazz's real life experiences as a young man growing up in the Bronx. Chazz plays Sonny LoSpecchio, the leader of the local gang who is feared by all the neighbourhood. One exception in the neighbourhood who refuses to live in fear is a Bronx bus driver named Lorenzo Anello, played by Robert De Niro. Lorenzo and his strongly opinionated wife Rosina, played brilliantly by Katherine Narducci, are the parents of a son named Calogero.We first get to know the young Calogero at the age of 9 years, as an industrious hustler who likes the action of the gambling scene run by Sonny LoSpecchio. Sonny immediately forms a special bond with the young Calogero and nicknames him \"C\". This bond is so strong and public that the young C is treated like royalty by the neighbourhood store vendors who live in fear of Sonny. This special bond between the gangster Sonny and the 9 year old C, causes grave concern for C's father Lorenzo. Tempers flare between father Lorenzo and mob boss Sonny over Sonny's mentoring of young Calogero. Somehow the father and gangster learn to respect each other's position with the upbringing of C, and over the next decade we watch as C grows in to a young man, loving both his father Lorenzo and his mentor Sonny, and of course C had a love interest. The movie takes place in the 1960's when racism was very much an issue, and C's love interest only adds to the parents worries, as C's girlfriend is a very pretty and bright black woman named Jane Williams, played by Taral Hicks. There are so many interesting stories and characters to follow in A Bronx Tale so much so that I rate the movie above The Godfather. I even thought the musical score was fantastic. There is one particular scene in the movie when a gang of bikers decide to take up residence in Sonny's bar. Sonny remains polite to the biker's leader, but when challenged Sonny turns the tables on the feared bikers with one statement which sent chills down my spine when he said to the biker leader \"well, now you can't leave\"....and he locks the front door. It is a chilling scene that wreaks of the \"don't mess with me mob mentality\". It is the type of movie that you just do not want to stop watching until the very end. Even after the movie ended, now twenty years later, I am still waiting for a sequel. The movie was directed by none other than Robert DeNiro, and I am surprised he did not direct many more movies. The only other movie he directed was The Good Shepherd.This is a movie I have gifted to all my close friends because it is truly a gift to all movie lovers and should be rated in the top 10 movies of the last half century. Chazz Palminteri originally wrote the story as a one man play. In 2013 Chazz brought his one man live show to Toronto, and my wife and I were lucky enough to purchase tickets to see Chazz in person act out all of the main characters that were in the film version. Wow, Chazz is very talented and passionate with the characters he portrays. If you have never seen this film you are missing one of the top 100 films of all time. As for his live one man play, even if you have to travel to see Chazz on the stage, go see it, as it is worth any price to witness Mr. Palminteri live and in person portray the many characters of A Bronx Tale. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 rating.",

Because everything about this movie works: I cared about the characters; I laughed (the scene at the racetrack with Johnny Mush is hilarious); I felt the suspense (C in the car with his foolish friends heading to the black section of town); and I enjoyed the realistic but downplayed violence (for a gangster movie); and yes, I was touched by the ending as well. I have no idea why this wonderful film never seemed to go beyond cult status, because it certainly deserved better! BTW--I'm not Italian. I'm Irish and German American descent.

The actor is usually interested in the immediacy of the moment, in pumping life into the project. The director is interested in moving that life with purpose using mechanisms outside the real of the actor: the eye, the flow, the memory. Usually, when you put an actor in charge, all you get is energy spurting all over the place; no form, no way into your soul; no life-altering opportunity, no art.A few of the good actors have crossed that line. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins have impressed me in both roles. Brando and Depp did some really quirky, risky stuff as directors. But Deniro and Redford are worse than bad, they take away from the film life, they cheapen the masters by copying without understanding, they dull our imagination.This film has lots of enveloping music; lots of cloying narrativeover -- both tricks of a poor director. It is excessively simple, and simply presented. Oddly, the only actor who transcends the limits of the gangster film is Pesci in the last few seconds with a pause.The episodes do not connect. They begin and end as if the writer wanted to close the thought by the end of his writing day,Deniro isn't stupid; he knows he messed up. You won't see him direct again.Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

And also, this film is loosely based on the childhood days of Chazz Palmenteri (who played Sonny in the film), who also wrote the screenplay of the film which was based on his play.This is one of the best coming-of-age crime drama which has all the great elements to be a wonderful mob film. The acting, the story, casting and also the direction is all really great. This film so has many great lesson to learn. (Is it better to be loved or feared?: this is one of the best piece of advice that I've heard in a mob film and one of the best in films, general), however, it is inspired by 'The Great Machiavelli'. A Bronx Tale deals with how one is shaped by their upbringing and environment. A great story told in a brilliant way. I also loved the narration in the film. This film has many great scenes which I think is excellent. That makes this film a wonderful piece.Remarkable writing and great direction. And also, this film has one phenomenal screenplay. De Niro's effort on direction is successful. De Niro does a skilled job in character development. With this film directed by De Niro, there are obvious influences from Martin Scorsese, but but I think this film holds up very well on its own and its message of morals and consequences is something very few films has mastered like this one.9.5/10.",

De Niro is good as a hardworking bus-driver dad, Chazz Palminteri makes a good local mobster, and the kid actor for Calogero is good as well. The gangsters seem a bit romanticized, and the imitation of Scorcese is fairly obvious, but its not bad. Basically it centers around the battle over the kid's affections between the mob boss and his dad, and between the lure of glamorous gangster life and his dad's honest hard work. There's also very entertaining scene of a bar brawl between mobsters and bikers.Is it just me, or did the movie become much less convincing during the second half? C has a romance with a black girl, which could have been fine, but it starts in an abrupt, unconvincing \"love at first sight\" fashion and turns into a preachy morality tale that reminded me of an after-school special, while C's moronic racist friends meet a deserved ugly end. And I'm sorry, Mr. Mob Boss is not that convincing as an enlightened source of fatherly wisdom.Anyway, the movie struck me as Scorcese-lite, good at first but with a Degrassi High-ish ending.",

A slightly predictable story of Italian-American life is offset by a more interesting portrait of racial segregation and changing times; and Chazz Palminteri is great as the boss. Unfortunately, the film remains somewhat schematic in feel, probably because it never quite trusts itself: a persistent narrative voice leads you through this tale, but leaves little scope for your own imagination.

I think the acting is great and the plot is also very clever.\"A Bronx Tale\" tells the story of Calogero, who later becomes known as \"C\", growing up in the Bronx in the 1960s. He later befriends a mobster named Sonny, and they have an everlasting friendship. Calogero's father Lorenzo, is a bus driver, and he tries to prevent his son from becoming associated with the mafia.My favorite part of the movie is when Sonny tells Calogero that if Jane unlocks the car door for him, then she is the right girl for him. I also like the fight with the bikers in the bar.Overall this is a really good movie and I suggest everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars!",

The head mafia guy in the district \"was loved by everyone\" (ahem, even though the hero's father despises him and we learn that very few people truly like him - the clich\u00e9 therefore being contradicted by the rest of the film) and of course, everyone has their own cute nickname. The only original addition was that of race and racism, specifically, against African-Americans (but hey, guess what, the hero is DIFFERENT - he doesn't really share the prejudices of his friends). This too though was handled rather ham-fistedly, at one point a character uses a racist term and the next minute the person on the receiving end of it has not only forgotten it but forgiven it completely. It was a plot-serving cop-out of the highest order.Furthermore, for a film directed by such a consummate actor as De Niro, there are a few bad performances - specifically by the teenage version of the hero and his love interest (who was actually appalling).That said, by half way through I got a bit more drawn into the story, but this is still a very inferior mafia/growing up film.",

            "content": "Robert de Niros directorial debut is commendable. As you watch the film it is clear that many of the aspects are influenced from de Niros time with Martin Scorsese. However, saying this, it is because of the similarities that the differences stand out more.The story gravitates around the local mob boss, Sonny, and his relation with Calogero - yet very little of the story is focused on Sonnys criminal life - we only get a few glimpses into his backhand dealings - mostly illegal gambling. The real story is of how a good natured kid can be pushed and pulled between influences surrounding him during his formative years. And it unfolds into some Bronx-Gangster themed Romeo and Juliet story - sans the tragedy.For a film set in the Bronx and focused around gangsters, the real crime is the realisation that those closest to Calogero/\"C\" are the ones who know him the least, and hurt him the most. The antagonists are his own feelings towards his family and friends, and the constant moral and situational conflicts which threaten to drown C. Surprisingly it is the \"bad guy\" who is the most honest with C, and the one who listens and recognises who he actually is.His father, played by Robert de Niro, is a typical Italian-American male and a straight shooter, who tries above and beyond to protect his son from the street, yet attempts to impose both a sense of honour and masculine strength onto his son - which only results in their relationship being at arms length.There are a lot of life lessons in the film - acceptance, judgements, racism, how the good can be bad and vice versa, and the virtues of not following the crowd.There is a lot of cultural exposure in the show. The film opens with the line \"This is the Fordham section of the Bronx... my home. A world unto itself. You can get to any borough in 15 minutes from here, but they might as well be 3,000 miles away\" - and this is proven with the African-American borough practically next door which comes across as miles and worlds apart.Being a crime/gangster film, there is surprisingly a lack of violence and action - only about 5 or 6 sequences with such content. However this does not weaken the story, nor are any of the sequences executed tastelessly.Stand outs - Francis Capra acting as Calogero at age 9 - his acting is impeccable. He has such attitude, and such composure for such a youngster.Whilst this film is no Goodfellas, I find it has been overlooked and underrated - it is definitely worth a watch if you like New York crime dramas, in the vein of neighbourhood gangs.",

By the age of 17 'C' will a proper education along with what he has learned on the streets. He finds himself being Sonny's shadow and his idol has treated him as his own. Lorenzo is hurt with his son's acquired notion that working men are suckers. 'C' will endure hard life lessons in the areas of love and death.A BRONX TALE is based on Palminteri's one-man play and is the directorial debut of De Niro. The younger Calogero is played by Francis Capra and the teenage 'C' is played by Lillo Brancato, who got the job by impersonating De Niro. Also in the cast: Taral Hicks, Clem Caserta, Eddie Montanaro, Alfred Sauchelli Jr. and Kathrine Narducci.Very good time period scenery, photography and props. One of my favorite scenes is when Sonny is driving the red convertible in reverse.

A shooting witnessed by the boy (nicknamed C by Sonny) is the starting point of a lasting bond between the gangster and the boy. His father Lorenzo disapproves. C grows up under the wing of both men, torn between his own natural honesty and his fascination with Sonny. C's neighbourhood friends get involved in theft, and racially fuelled fights. When C falls for an African American girl, things don't get any better.....It's quite admirable for an actor with such screen presence as De Niro to not only try and emulate Scorcese's arguably finest hour Goodfellas, but to take a back seat when it comes to letting people show their range.But as admirable emulating Goodfellas is, you cannot help but compare this film to that, and ultimately, finding many flaws with the film. Yes, the source material is based on Palminteri's theatre production, but there are so many similarities, right to a special guest appearance from an old friend in the last scene.But it's still a wonderful film, seeing Henry, sorry C grow up and create this subliminal partition from the real world, and the fantasy he is living when he is with Sonny.The racial tension is a pivotal point in the films narrative, and it's like a metaphorical melting pot that bubbles more and more and the film concentrates more on C, rather than the tension between Lorenzo and Sonny.Some of the scenes are beautifully crafted, especially the dice scene, which is as funny as it is sinister. De Niro keeps an air of tension in the film, but divides it with the family life, and the mobster life, and when the two interact with each other, the fight for the alpha male in C's life is up there with some of the most thrilling scenes seen in crime drama.For a debut, De Niro has crafted something that isn't just wonderfully authentic, but keeps the audience involved in all aspects of the story.it's a shame that it's sadly fallen under the radar since it's release, but it's worth seeking out for the similarities between this and Goodfellas.",

            "content": "Robert DeNiro stars and for the first time directs what was obviously a pet project, the growing up in the early 60's of a young Italian-American boy in the Bronx, New York. De Niro plays the father of what we see as initially a 9 year old kid, Colegiro, later shortened to C, a boy so fascinated and attracted to the power and attendant lifestyle of the neighbourhood Mr Big, the self-styled Tony, that he instinctively covers for him after the latter goes too far In ending a local feud. This linkage between proves life-changing, as, despite the workaday honesty of his bus-driver father setting a perfectly good example, it's the lure of charismatic Tony's Machiavellian lifestyle which has the bigger pull on the boy, posing him some big moral dilemmas later in life.Despite some extremely violent scenes, in particular when some troublesome \"Hell's Angels\" get run out of town and when a gang-feud between the Italians and the blacks reaches a literally explosive conclusion, at its heart, this movie has a soft, sentimental centre as young C, wouldn't you know it, falls West Side Story-style for a young black girl.Watching the movie. you get to thinking that growing upon the Bronx is a pretty full-on experience with probably just too much going on, stretching credibility about a bus-run too far, but nevertheless it's never less than entertaining, with some humorous inserts, like the naming of Tony's cronies at the start and the moment the gang's horse-racing hopes turn, literally, to mush, counterpointed by the struggle of the two father-figures for the soul of Coligero. DeNiro shows some neat directorial touches, especially the synchronised title sequence set to music and also gets fine performances from his young leads, adroitly underplaying his own part so as not to dominate proceedings.No doubt this film means more to Americans, especially New Yorkers of a certain extraction and age-group, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief at young C's rich and lurid boy-hood and was perfectly happy to tuck into this big bowl of Italian pasta, good to the last drop.",

It appears at the beginning, throughout, and again at the end. It's practically the closing line.Yet we never see the MANIFESTATION of said talent in Calogero. What's he talented in? School? Baseball? Italian cuisine? We never get even the slightest indication of what that line might refer to when it comes to our protagonist.In my opinion, if such an important (if not THE most important) aspect of the movie had been \"anchored\" in something concrete (if we'd seen Calogero excel in baseball, school, whatever), the movie might have packed a stronger punch. Calogero leaves his mafia ways, having finally realized what his father has been talking about all along - that there's nothing sadder than a wasted talent.But we never see what Calogero's talent is!That's why the oft-repeated wasted-talent moral seems to be left hanging in mid-air without any concrete point of reference. It might as well have been replaced with \"Take your vitamins daily\". It's no more than an abstract wise saying. And that's why this movie hits the home run, but there's no bases on the field.Or something.",

Coupled with the plot device of Calogero trying to choose his way of life within these streets gives the film some pretty nice action scenes and suspenseful moments, which is good for its sometimes slow plot.

It's a sparkling diamond of American film making.A great portrayal of love, loyalty, friendship, ties between father and son, and the seemingly trivial decisions that can alter our entire lives.Chaz Palminteri's script is perfect (in fact, I can't think of a single thing that could've been added or changed, it's really impressive).Joe Pesci also makes an appearance as Sonny's friend Carmine, and his presence (along with Lorenzo finally respecting Sonny), really makes the ending great.It should've won some Academy Awards.

Both have the kids best interests at heart, but the way they mentor him is the whole plot of the story. There are several sub plots in this story. One plot was the complicated relationship of father and son; the relationship between an Italian mother and son; a young love story with a special twist in that its an interracial relationship in the turbulent racially tense 1960s; finally, the relationship between young friends growing up in the same neighborhood and all the mischief that results from their exploits.

Basically in the Bronx, New York, nine year old Calogero Anello (Francis Capra) is the son of bus driver Lorenzo (Robert De Niro) and his wife Rosina (Kathrine Narducci), he has a fascination with the local mobsters of the neighbourhood, led by Sonny LoSpecchio (The Usual Suspects' Chazz Palminteri). One day Calogero witnesses Sonny murder someone, NYPD detectives question him and ask him to identify the killer from caught suspects, he chooses to keep quiet about Sonny, the mob leader takes a liking to the boy, giving him the nickname 'C', and introduced to the mob he makes money working in the Mafia bar and throwing dice, Lorenzo tells Sonny to stay away from his son, but Calogero ignores his father's words. Eight years pass, and Calogero (Lillo Brancato) is now a young man and still seeing Sonny on a regular basis, and despite the tension between the African American and Italian communities, particularly among his friends, he meets and is smitten with African American girl Jane Williams (Taral Hicks), and after getting to know her he arranges a date with her, he asks for advice from both Sonny and his father. The same night Calogero's friends beat up a group of black cyclists, he is powerless to stop them but tries to defend black young man Willy (Sobe Bailey), Jane's brother, so when Jane and he are meant to meet for their date she has brought her brother with her, he accuses Calogero of being one of the assailants, in the argument Calogero uses a racist cuss, the two siblings walk away upset. Lorenzo confronts his son about still seeing Sonny, and after leaving an argument Sonny himself confronts the young man, accusing him of putting a bomb on his car and attempting to assassinate him, Calogero pleads emotionally his innocence, the mob leader accepts this, Lorenzo also gets involved turning up during this, but he is held by the mobsters. Calogero catches up with Jane, she tells him that Willie has admitted he knows he wasn't one of those who beat him up, they make amends, but he remembers the plan by his friends to assault the African American community, they rush to stop it, but by the time they get there they are already dead, one of the thrown lit liquor bottles was thrown back and blew up their car. Calogero goes to Sonny to thank him for his help, but the son of the person he murdered eight year ago shoots the gangster in the back of the head, a funeral is held and those who knew him pay their respects, one man named Carmine (Joe Pesci) turns up as well, the young man recognises him from the shooting incident eight years ago. Surprisingly Lorenzo also turns up, he understands his son cared for Sonny, but he also comes to pay his own respects and thank him for saving the life of his son, he never hated Sonny, just resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly, the father and son make peace, Calogero has learnt life lessons from his experiences with both men. Also starring Clem Caserta as Jimmy Whispers, Alfred Sauchelli Jr. as Bobby Bars, Frank Pietrangolare as Danny Ko, Robert D'Andrea as Tony Toupee and Eddie Montanaro as Eddie Mush. De Niro is well regarded for gangster movies, so he does very well both directing and playing the father of the leading young man, Brancato is a great choice to play the confused teenager stuck between two sides, Capra is also great as the child version of the character, and of course Palminteri is terrific as the mob boss. The story is based on both Palminteri's autobiographical experiences and his play, you can tell De Niro has his input in this film as it seems very much like GoodFellas, there is not much sentimentality and lots of hard hitting material to savour up, it works really well as both a character study and an intelligent portrayal of how bad influence can mess with morals, a great crime drama. Very good!",

They both star in this movie about a boy growing up in the Bronx in the 50s and 60s. De Niro plays his dad, and Chazz is a hood, who is feared by all in his community, and who serves an influence to the boy. I really can't tell you how much I love this movie. De Niro and Chazz's love of the period are obvious to the viewer in the details, and the acting of these pros and the two young actors playing 'C' are incredible. While we see De Niro try to instill good values and morals into his son, a lot of the movie's goodness is there for the viewer to see rather than being told. The boy is exposed to the criminal element, because of a bar two doors down, which he is inevitably drawn to, despite his mother's orders to stay away from it, and because these \"hoods\" hang out all around him. He is exposed to his friends' prejudice against the blacks, but he realizes he has to think for himself and live by his own conscious. Along with the serious tones of the movie is its sense of humor, with Chazz sending people to the bathroom, because he's trying to concentrate on playing dice. And, of course, the soundtrack helps to set the mood, but it's only secondary to the film's heart, which is perfectly embodied in the young boy looking for himself and love and acceptance, in a world that could be overturned anytime, in this Bronx tale.",

Good job on the story, acting and directing well done to all involved. I was able to relate to the hanging out, our couple of long blocks in all directions and others coming into our turf uninvited. Yelling out of upstairs windows, stoops and lots of lively activity going on in the streets day and night which by the way exists to this day in the city that never sleeps i.e. New York. Robert Deniro captures his role of the everyday working man who makes an ordinary living but in an honest, transparent and consistent way. This movie has it all plus a awkward love story which was and is the way it happens. Pay close attention to how everyone in the neighborhood knows everyone else or about them. Anything you did quickly got back to your mother/father. On another note, with all the mischief I got into both plan and unplanned, I was lucky to make it out of my childhood alive and wouldn't you know it, its covered here too. Any thing happens out of the norm, the neighborhood comes alive and together is demonstrated here.

            "content": "Robert De Niro's \"A Bronx Tale\" is the story of a hard-working Italian-American man whose teenaged son takes an ill-advised interest in the neighborly Mafia figures. De Niro plays Lorenzo, a bus driver from the Bronx who works hard for a living and is perfectly content with his low amount of income, if only because it is clean. When he is offered a small Mafia job, he turns it down. The local Mafia kingpin is Sonny (Chazz Palminteri). \"As I grew in age, he grew in power,\" says young Calogero, a.k.a. C, a.k.a. Lorenzo's son. In the beginning of the film, nine-year-old C witnesses a murder at the hands of Sonny, but doesn't rat on the man. Soon he is taken under the wing of the gangster, being thrust into the middle of gambling rackets and running errands of sorts. Lorenzo despises the Mafia and pleads with Sonny to leave his son alone. \"They didn't speak ever again,\" says C, now seventeen years old (played by Lillo Brancato) and narrating the story. In a way, C suddenly has two fathers -- Lorenzo, who gives him good advice; and Sonny, whose advice is often times witty but not always the right thing. C is a confused kid, unsure of what to do with his life, hanging out with the wrong crowds. De Niro's performance as Lorenzo is the most touching in the film, because it is so true, and he displays the same caring side of all parents who want to give their kids good advice.One of the movie's only flaws is the stereotypical love interest subplot, this time between C and a sixteen-year-old black girl who goes to his school. C is the only kid on his block who doesn't want to take part in racist beatings and he is apparently the only one, at the time, who isn't bothered with the blacks' presence on the street. What is so disappointing about this rather unnecessary addition to the plot is that it feels tacky, one of the only unrealistic moments in an otherwise grandiose motion picture. C steps over the boundaries of being a respectable character, brought up by a very wise father, to a downright stereotypical Good Guy, who appreciates the minority figures and is the lone voice in a large crowd of haters. I'm not saying that C shouldn't fall in love with a black girl, but the entire subplot is entirely out of place, unnecessary, unbelievable (there is absolutely no chemistry between the two actors) and, to be blunt, silly. Silly, and a major error on De Niro's part, because it tries to manipulate its audience and turn C into an unrealistic, open-minded guy -- the sort of character who would have never existed back then, especially under the influence he grew up in.Oh well. The movie is still brilliant, almost perfect, aside from that superfluous subplot.The film was written by Palminteri, based on his own one-man play from 1989. As Sonny, Palminteri proves that he can exhibit the same sort of oozing confidence that De Niro displayed as Jimmy in Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas,\" the best mob movie ever made, which bears a few resemblances to \"A Bronx Tale.\" De Niro claims that in order to separate his film from others that have already dealt with the same sort of backdrop, he studied his own movies -- particularly those directed by Scorsese -- and tried to stray away from many techniques and ideas used in those movies. What De Niro delivers is an occasionally funny, occasionally painful, coming-of-age drama with guts. De Niro is right: these sorts of films have been made before, but in his directorial debut, De Niro proves that he isn't just one of the greatest actors of all time, but a gifted director with a stunning vision. De Niro's love and respect for New York City shines through in \"A Bronx Tale,\" just about as much as his very obvious attention to detail and characters. This is one of the best Mafia movies ever made, even if it's towards the bottom of the list.4.5/5 stars.",

Well if it`s the same Robert De Niro may I suggest that he stops starring in movies where he does nothing except mug for the camera and concentrate on directing more movies . De Niro directs this very well and has resisted the temptation to cast himself as the chief wiseguy instead he plays a bus driver who only appears in a few short - Though important - scenes . If I have any criticism of the directing it`s that it slightly resembles Scorsese a little too much with the voice over and the musical soundtrack , mind you I think every American director was using this technique in the 1990s and I doubt if I could do much better and by it`s ironic when you think about who directed  but the cast never ever go OTT and give good and often understated performances  . The story too is both touching and haunting and is far more intelligent than AMERICAN HISTORY X at pointing out the self destructive flaws of racism . If I have a criticism it`s that the story is slightly episodic and lacks a central plot but it was based on a stageplay and at least with this \" based on a stage play \" story we`re not subjected to flashbacks every 10 minutes",

For this and that I just saw A Bronx Tale last night and while it was entertaining, good in parts it is mostly a disappointment for me even that I wasn't expecting to see a film as brilliant as Scorsese's Goodfellas. Well, De Niro has also an acting part (as in his second directorial effort The Good Shepherd that was released 13 years after A Bronx Tale and that have still to see) and is a good performance by De Niro as Lorenzo, the father of the main character Calogero. However this film hasn't terrific acting everywhere, to begin with the kid that plays Calogero age 9 (Francis Capra) yet this the first part of the film is the one that I liked the most, with a good De Niro, funny parts, is just very entertaining. A Bronx Tale has two parts, first part is in 1960 and is a pretty simple set: on one hand Calogero has in his father a real example, a working man devoted to his family and on the other hand has in the gangster Sonny (Chazz Palminteri is good, he also wrote the film) the man who is nothing but his idol, the man he really admires, the man who has never look at him, the man who everybody fears. The main thing in the second part of the film, that begins when we jump to 1968, is a racial issue: C's (Sonny renamed Calogero as C) all time friends have problems each time black men pass through \"their\" neighborhood. C on the other hand has no problem and he likes a black girl, is all really conventional, predictable, you know. Here we have Francis Capra, Lillo Brancato Jr. (who plays C during the second part of the film so who is Calogero age 17) and Taral Hicks (who plays C's love interest Jane Williams) doing their screen debut, none of these 3 did were good choices, the main character itself is very weak and very unlikable but mostly the problem is Taral Hicks, each time she was on the screen I was thinking, and also laughing a little, \"why De Niro didn't found better actors?\", she is really terrible. So A Bronx Tale was mostly a disappointment, still it has really great music: Hendrix (his brilliant version of Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\"), The Beatles (one of my favourites from them, \"Come Together\"), Cream, The Kinks, \"Nights in White Satin\" by The Moody Blues.",

His father Lorenzo (Robert De Niro) tries his best to give C what he wants, but he has never really been able to since he has an honest living as a bus driver. C has always looked up to local organized crime head Sonny (Chazz Palmentieri) more than anyone else, and tries to imitate him, but Sonny has not even met C yet. Then one fateful day, in a fight over what appears to be merely a parking space, Sonny decides to help out his friend (Joe Pesci in an amusing cameo) and shoots his assailant. C saw the whole thing, and the cops know C saw the whole thing. So they give C the opportunity to point out the gunman. C is put up in front of a lineup of \"the usual suspects\" but does not point the finger at any of them. Sonny is touched by this, and takes a minute to talk to C. He then offers Lorenzo the opportunity to deliver deals for Sonny in exchange for about 3 times the salary of what he makes now. He refuses, bent on making his living decently.  Sonny begins to let C around at his bar, making him the boy people call on when they want a beer or something. A relationship grows between the 2, but when Lorenzo finds out about the bar, and the money C is making at the bar, he refuses the money and makes C give it back. Later, you see C as a 17 year old (Lillo Brancato). Then even more tension begins as C struggles definitely to find his place in the Bronx. He's not sure if he wants to hang out with his bunch of racist friends, or work at the bar with the Sonny and the gang. Then he meets Jane (Taral Hicks) and things really get interesting. This is because Jane is black, and C is falling for her anyway....... > This movie is great, but a poor performance from Lillo Brancato and a little too much ground covered in the movie prevents it from being a classic. However, this movie is definitely worth watching for its perspective on racism, first love, and organized crime. Chazz Palminteri is positively oscarworthy and De Niro gives one of his best performances of the 90's.",

A stupid waste it may be, but it'd be a shame if it overshadows the movie itself, as Robert De Niro's first stint as director provided the world with an excellent film, worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with any of the big players in the gangster movie genre.The movie tells the story of Calogero, a young Italian boy raised in the New York Bronx who has two very different father figures watching out for him. One is his birth father (De Niro), a low paid bus driver who doesn't want his only son to become involved in the wave of crime tainting the neighbourhood. The other is the local Mafia Kingpin Sonny (Chazz Palmintieri), who develops a bond with the boy when he refuses to rat on him following a murder in the street. As he grows up, he finds himself torn between these two distinct heroes who keep finding themselves at loggerheads, while violence in the neighbourhood threatens all of them.As the film plays out, the story becomes all the more riveting. De Niro is a triumph as always, but it is Palmintieri who really shines here. Sonny is perhaps the most human mafia Don the movies ever saw and his friendship with Calogero is really quite touching, despite the rift it creates with his birth father. But when all is said and done, Sonny has nothing but his best interests at heart, repeatedly encouraging him not to go down the same road he has and trying to steer him away from his rather deranged friends who seem fixated on becoming involved in crime.Whatsmore, the image of the Bronx we get is incredibly eye-catching, striking out like an urban wasteland of violence and dog-eat-dog ethics. Racial tensions between the minority groups manifest themselves in the street fights between Italian and African gangs, while a bar room brawl between the mafia and a bike gang early on leaves us in no doubt as to the hostile nature their world encapsulates.With the stereotypical depictions of many of the Mafia members (overweight Italians in vests with slick black hair engaging in 'business deals') remaining in place, A Bronx Tale covers familiar territory, but with the engrossing three way relationship between C and his two fathers, it also covers new ground. It breathes new life into the gangster genre and the end is nothing less than satisfying.",

But DeNiro managed to get A+ performances from Lillo Brancato Jr., Francis Capra and Taral Hicks. I thought Chazz Palminteri should have garnered an Oscar for his role. The fact that this was his screenplay, it was evident that he poured his heart into the role, and he was thoroughly believable as the neighborhood boss Sonny. Nuances are very important in a film, and DeNiro manages to capture the turbulent 60s perfectly. One particular scene is especially memorable. In the first conversation between the teenage Colagero and Jane -- when he's walking her home from school -- I'm not sure if the actors were allowed to ad-lib, but the dialogue was perfect, because it epitomized the awkward interaction of young love. Aside from that, the movie is honest about gangster life, racism and loyalty. The movie isn't preachy, and it doesn't have the feel-good ending of an afterschool special. What it does is show that even the worse people have good in them and that our choices are what ultimately decide our fate. A film with very few flaws.",

            "content": "Is there anything in the movie business that Robert de Niro(my favorite actor together with Harrison Ford and Sean Connery)can't do?Maybe,but he can direct movies as we see in A Bronx Tale.And on top of that he also plays the leading character in the movie and as usual he does it flawless.The story is pretty good although maybe sometimes a little bit cliche.But it is the acting that makes this movie so great!Robert de Niro is brilliant as the concerned father of a would be gangster and the performances of Chazz Palminteri and the two Calogero's(Lilo Brancato and Francis Capra) are also very good.And then there is the acting genius Joe Pesci,we hear him(unique voice in the movie industry)in the early parts of the movie but we get to see him at the end of the movie. Another great part is the soundtrack.De Niro probably learned this from his master and my favorite director:Martin Scorsese.He used famous songs as a background in his epic movie Casino(10/10),their best movie after Taxi Driver.The songs in A Bronx Tale are well chosen and give a good image of the period in which the movie takes place.For instance the movie starts with a great Rock 'n Roll song,I wonder Why by Dion(he was an actual Bronx man)and the Belmonts.Later in the movie we hear Nights in White Satin during a violent and emotional scene.This song gives the scene an even better view.Overall,Robert de Niro has passed his exam perfectly with this movie about gangsters and family-life. 10/10",

The dynamic between the three main characters is an interesting one and it is good to see that they did not just settle for Gangster bad, parent good as both these men are father figures for the main character and both give good and bad points of view. The film, at the end of the day is about the decisions you make and C learns the lesson that both men try and teach him in thier own ways. If you apreciate good films then you should like this movie and although for some viewers it may not contain enough violence and swearing for their liking I think its a wonderful film that doesn't need these elements to make its point and so wisely keeps it cool.

            "content": "I had actually seen this film about 10 years ago, but my husband's memory is faulty and he insisted we hadn't seen it, so I watched it again.I've learned a lot in 10 years and while my initial review might have been a 4 or 5, there is no other number for this but 1.The majority of this movie is basically dictated to us via voiceover from the teenaged Calogero, better known as \"C\" -- because that is apparently the only nickname that mob boss/street corner king \"Sonny\" (Chazz Palminteri) could come up with.\"C\" (as performed by the handsome but minimally talented Lillo Brancato) takes us through his childhood and teenage years, observing everything with a none-too-bright point of view. We are hand-led throughout the \"tale,\" and if there's a moment that Chazz (the writer and the star) thought that the audience might not understand, it is stated in clear, on-the-nose dialogue.There are multiple stories contained within this film, but the only one that actually held my interest for a moment was the budding love affair between \"C\" and the plain-named \"Jane\" (Taral Hicks), who, in the parlance of the day, was known as \"a colored girl.\"Because \"C\" is tight with his childhood buddies, who have all turned into obnoxious, racist young thugs who somehow think that \"hanging out\" on the street and yammering about pointless things is the height of living, \"C\" must keep his interest in Jane a secret.\"C\" is also enamored of Sonny, who takes interest in him as a child because \"C\" (as \"Calogero,\" performed by Francis Capra, a boy with beautiful eyes and eyelashes, but not much talent) witnessed Sonny murdering a man in cold blood in daylight, but because he is a product of his neighborhood, he doesn't rat Sonny out. This makes Sonny, who is the Lord and Savior of his tiny bit of turf in the Bronx, think highly of Calogero, and thus begins the story of their father-son relationship... despite the fact that Robert De Niro (as \"Lorenzo,\" a bus driver with a thimble full of morals more than Sonny) is Calogero's father.You see how convoluted and complicated and endless this all this? That's how it came across on the screen. The story did not really know what it wanted to focus on: Sonny and C's faux dad-son relationship; Sonny's complete power over his 'hood; Sonny's band of misfit henchmen who worship the ground he walks on; Lorenzo's attempts to raise a good son, despite the negative influences he's constantly surrounded by; the burgeoning romance between \"C\" and \"Jane\"; the deadly realities of what happens when the black folk move too close to the Italian neighborhood; the pointless lives of the young thugs that emulate Sonny and his goons, and to whom \"C\" feels beholden...It goes on and on. This might make sense as a limited series, if it can find its center, which this film never does. Also, it relies heavily on voiceover, which, at the time, must have been thought to be really elegant and the proper way to tell a story, but in 2022, it comes across as artifice and annoys within the first two minutes.The movie does do a good job of recreating the era, or it seems to. And it is also a sad comment on people's inability to accept others that are different from them.The ending, also dominated by a voiceover, lets us know how much \"C\" has learned and what's important in life, even though he never ever seemed to learn anything or show any maturity. He also held on to his lack of critical thinking and rage almost to the end, neither of which served him well.Overall, except for a few brief moments with \"Jane,\" who is sunny and sweet and seems to have some sense and intelligence, everyone else in this movie seems locked into incredibly limited views of themselves. As such, there is no one to root for or care about (except maybe Jane, but even she returns to \"C\" after he cruelly insults her and his brother, so, I'm thinking she didn't think things through, either).One fun tidbit: There's a moment where Calogero's mother \"Rosina\" (played by Kathrine Narducci) says something like, \"I have to go check on the baby.\" -- We never see a baby, nor do we see any other child as \"C\" grows up. Nor, in fact, do we see \"Rosina\" once \"C\" becomes a teen.This story is heavy on angry, racist, small-minded men who think they are kings of their turf and have no idea of what life has to offer, since they think the world is their corner.Perhaps the best thing about the movie was the soundtrack, which featured many hits of the day.Otherwise, unless you long to hear people speaking in a Bronx accent for over two hours, enjoy lots of violence, and don't mind being led by the nose through plot points, you are missing nothing.",

            "content": "A Bronx Tale successfully brings out every emotion your system can handle. From anger, to joy, to laughter, to happiness, to sympathy, to empathy, to tears, and to, finally, satisfaction as the final scene fades into credits. This is De Niro's directorial debut and he handles the challenge exquisitely. Complimented by Chazz Palminteri's slick and fearless writing that documents the struggles, the gangs, and the racism of the Bronx streets with no sugarcoating and no easy ways out.Adapted from its stage play counterpart, A Bronx Tale focuses on the famous area in New York where little nine year old Calogero (played by Francis Capra during his tender years) is growing up on the unapologetic streets with his bus driver father Lorenzo (De Niro) and his nervous mother. Lorenzo frequently warns Calogero that \"the saddest thing in life is a wasted talent,\" hoping that his son will take the path of untold success later in life.One day, while sitting idly on his stoop with his buddies, Calogero witnesses a murder. The murder was made by the area mafia boss Sonny (Palminteri). Him and his crew are respected, at the same time feared for their unpredictable actions and their checkered history. When called back to the scene by detectives looking for the murderer, young Calogero lies and refuses to confess. His father is subtly proud, but warns his son that he has just done a good thing for a bad person. The good news is their family won't be on the hit list. The bad news is their family is now on the suspicious list.Eight years later, Calogero, now played by Lillo Brancato Jr., is nicknamed \"C\" by Sonny and has become his main-man. His second son as well as his partner in crime. His father is somewhat oblivious to what his son has been up to recently, but he believes he can take care of himself, while still nudging him in the right direction.Sonny's philosophy is greatly different from Lorenzo's. It's \"nobody really cares.\" When the chips are down, who's there to care? Nobody. You're a worthless human. The brutally honest, shameless half of the glass. Sonny's philosophy sticks with Calogero, but he also keeps his father's in mind. Do the two connect? Maybe in some ambiguous, unorthodox way, but it just seems they are two contradicting ways of life. Here's a film that also shows us that if we're lucky, we get two different outlooks on life from two very different people. A man who works in a town and a man who owns it.De Niro was in a very rough position when it came time to grab a hold of the camera for this film. He could either take the easy way out and make a Goodfellas-style mobster flick or mimic his stellar character's lifestyle in Raging Bull. But he doesn't. He most likely was the go-to guy for help with the script and offered Palminteri advice, but in no way is this another mafia film. It's a unique kind of mafia film. It shows the long-lasting and life changing effects it has on a youth growing up on the wrong side of the streets.This greatly reminds me of a phenomenal film from the eighties that tackles the same sort of subject. The film was John Singleton's Boyz N The Hood, setting its sights on three troubled youths growing up in the hood and getting caught in the mix of crime, drugs, and racism. The film was Singleton's directorial debut as well, featured stellar performances from every actor in it, a genius script, and some fantastic honesty about the life of the hood. A Bronx Tale does the same, but centers its story around the mafia. Not glorifying the violence, not acting pretentious over other classics of the same genre, but taking a clich\u00e9 and turning it into a gritty reality.What is important to learn from A Bronx Tale is that it's a movie with values. It believes that beliefs and values should be the first thing someone should consider when in a serious situation. Sometimes we don't think about the consequences and dive right into what we think will satisfy ourselves and turn out the way we want in no time. It too forms the question; is it better to be universally loved or feared? I'd rather be a little bit of both with a strong blend of respect.Starring: Lillo Brancato, Jr., Chazz Palminteri, Robert De Niro, Taral Hicks, Francis Capra, Kathrine Narducci, Clem Caserta, and Joe Pesci.

            "content": "\"It don't take much strength to pull a trigger. But try and get up every morning day after day, and work for a living. Let's see him try that. Then we'll see who the real tough is. The working man's the tough guy. Your father's the tough guy\" Lorenzo Anello (Robert De Niro) to his son Calogero (Francis Capra) Never truer words of wisdom have ever been spoken in a gangster film since \"The Godfather\" and through a simple yet powerful speech, De Niro defines what I humbly call the 'anti-gangster' genre.Most classic gangster films tackled the theme of Family in a way or another, as to underline the ambivalent nature of men, capable of the worst actions in the name of the noblest virtues, if not for pure survival instinct. This applies to \"The Godfather\", but also other classics such as \"Bonnie and Clyde\", \"Road to Perdition\" and even the pre-Hayes gangster flicks that featured gangsters as more than simple cold-blooded killers: Tony Camonte in \"Scarface\" (and his 1983 alter-ego Montana) had an oedipal devotion to his sister, Tom Powers in \"The Public Enemy\" envied his honest brother and the same James Cagney was an unforgettable mama's boy in \"White Heat\".The family element is less an alibi than a plot element inviting us to understand what kind of motives lies behind the cruelest acts: when organized crime becomes a matter of territory and survival, it necessarily inspires the most bestial instincts, and nourishes the feeling of belonging to the same blood. Family is important enough for honest people, but for those who are in a constant mortal danger, it's not just a sacred value, it's the only one that can prevail, and keep a level of humanity and dignity to rather despicable characters. I apologize for the length of this introduction, but sometimes the genius of a film is to make us question our most intimate convictions. All I mentioned is precisely the reason why I love gangster films, they often happen to be 'more than that' because of the intricate interaction between Crime and Family (sometimes, similar themes like friendships in \"Once Upon a Time in America\") and Robert De Niro's Bronx Tale made me questions my own appreciation of gangster flicks in a way that even Scorsese didn't.The speech Robert De Niro gives to his little boy about the working man being the tough guy, is the emotional core of the film. The 8-year old Calogero aka 'C', after witnessing the local mob boss Sonny (Chazz Palminteri) killing a man, took the wise decision not to identify him when questioned by the police, therefore starting a father-and-son bonding that enriched his education with stuff that would have never been taught by his father, a modest bus driver. Yes, Sonny IS a gangster, but he owns the Bronx, he's respected, feared and somewhat loved, exuding a charisma that inspires all these relatively compatible feelings. Tutoring 'C', Sonny progressively becomes the counterpart of Lorenzo's education, and the first act of the film features a small 'C' in the same position than Henry Hill in the beginning of \"Goodfellas\" with a slower pacing and a great dosage of drama and humor. We smile at young 'C' tutored by the bad-ass Sonny, until the film really takes the beautiful dimension of an existential conflict.The conflict is perfectly illustrated in the poster, where both De Niro and Palminteri face each other and 'C' is like taken hostage of two visions of life that would \"shape his life forever\" but each one, differently. I mentioned \"Goodfellas\" because although it has a superior quality, \"A Bronx Tale\" strikes by its thought-provoking story: we're seduced by the gangster lifestyle but also witness the way it's endured by the parents. It's just as if \"Goodfellas\" focused on Mr. Hill's character. But while Scorsese was only teasing us until the end where we could realize how foolish we were to root for scumbags, De Niro doesn't copy his directorial model (I allow myself this assumption since the movie has a strong Scorsesian feel), and never falls in the patronizing trap of blind denunciation, it's never Lorenzo vs. Sonny, good vs. bad guys, but about young 17-year old 'C' (Lillo Brancato) who tries to take the best from each one. Of course at the beginning, he's rooting for Sonny, but he genuinely loves and respects his father, and at the end, he knows he learned from both.When 'C' asks Sonny: \"Is it better to be loved or feared?\" Sonny replies that it's nice but difficult: \"If i had a choice I'd rather be feared, fear last longer then love. Friendships bought with money mean nothing\" This moment echoes the reading of some pages from Machiavelli's \"Prince\", a book Sonny admitted to have read in prison. The character of Sonny can indeed be described as Machiavellian, always justifying his actions by a sort of cold pragmatism. On the other hand, Lorenzo is more of a practical man, who takes life as it is, and takes his role as a father very seriously. He loves to have fun with his boy at the baseball game, he tells him to finish his steak, he provides some advices about sex and love, and he's the average guy, tender and tough enough to inspire our respect and our admiration.De Niro wonderfully balances between two educations with enough courage to show how crime can really waste a life, and enough detachment to prove that one doesn't need to be criminal to spend his whole life wasting his talent, which is even worse. Crime is certainly not glorified but not simplistically condemned either, hence my epithet of \"anti-gangster\", I could have said revisionist but although the ending seems to lean over the honest vision, \"A Bronx Tale\" less tries to teach us lessons but to show us that the greatest lessons take sometimes the most unlikely media to be taught.",

Yet the film seems to be a country revisited several times. The new element is the point of view that is adopted here, that of a kid who is growing from 8 to 17 and is the witness of the law of the neighborhood and how this law is imposed by some group of self appointed people who impose security and guarantee it then. In this case it is an Italian boss, and on the other side it is the Blacks, and no detail is given. What makes this film interesting is how the son sees the world and how he comes to accepting this or that idea, from his father or the local neighborhood boss. We see his personality growing, his independence blooming, at times without knowing it, his reason and moderation expanding at times against his own feelings and convictions. You add girls to that and then accidents on the road of social peace and you may have some real drama in which you discover the real value of this man, or even your father, who did not hate this or that or anyone in particular but rather tried, at times awkwardly to protect you. There are a few funny elements here and there, more dramatic elements now and then, but a lot of pathos all the time.

            "content": "A Bronx Tale is a superb film covering a whole host of genres with very impressive acting performances and interesting use of music/song. Robert De Niro has directed very well and has done his usual, flawless best with the few scenes he was acting in. Palminteri on the other hand, has a much larger role which he delivers with the usual grit and aggression you'd expect with him when he's involved in crime films (I'm thinking 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Running Scared'). What's also rather special is that Palminteri wrote it.The film very much feels like a play in a strange sort of way. The use of diegetic music within the films universe is present and each song is spot on with the scene it's overlapping. From Huey Smith and the Clowns' 'Don't You Just Know It' which is obviously a very chirpy, bouncy, cheeky song which is playing over kids messing around with a fruit truck to the mellow 'I Only Have Eyes For You' which introduces itself at various stages during the protagonist's gaze at a girl from a rival gang in the neighborhood. Each track works very well and it does feel at times, like it's some sort of Broadway, gangland musical which makes everything feel much more unique.What makes this film a little bit more special is that its 'Goodfellas-esque' approach in telling the story of one boy whom becomes one man allows us to map on more to the character and his surroundings and his relationships which build up and fall down over the period of time with others, namely his childhood friends, his father played by De Niro and his 'second father'/boss played by Palminteri. The lack of De Niro on screen actually adds to the atmosphere in a rather odd way. We are seeing him or 'noticing him' about as much as the protagonist is and that's only every now and again; nothing special, whereas Palminteri's character is very much the focal point for, not only business, but also pleasure and socialising.I think 'A Bronx Tale' has snuck into my top ten favorite crime films as it feels gritty and unique and that's what does it for me; the atmosphere and real feel of a crime film. The simplistic street setting, the chain of cause and effect plot points which move onto one another at just the right moments, the crafty use of diegetic music all combining nicely at various intervals to create something truly moving. There is something in this film for everyone: the music, the tragedy, the romantic element, the action/crime theme- everything. I'd recommend it.",

            "review_title": "Solid mob film that really pulls at the 'heart strings'",
            "content": "I really enjoyed 'A Bronx Tale' and found it to be a wonderful film that tears your emotions to shreds.We begin in 1960 with Lorenzo Anello (De Niro) and his son Calogero and his wife Rosina who are all living in the Bronx. Lorenzo is a bus driver who earns a fairly pitiful wage. Lorenzo is a hard working man who does everything he can to provide for his family (including working 7 days a week). He is aware of some of the 'questionable' activities which occur in his neighbourhood, but prefers to keep his head down and not get involved. He also tries to keep his son out of trouble by telling him to 'sit on the step' outside their house and not to go near the bar (due to the Mob hanging out there). However, when Lorenzo's son witnesses lead Mob member Sonny (Chazz Palminteri)killing someone outside his home and then deliberately fails to pick him out of a police line up, Sonny and his crew develop respect for Calogero and decide to take him under their wing; One major aspect of film enjoyment is the ability to buy into the premise and for me this is where A Bronx Tale works. It is loosely based on Palminteri's experiences as a child so it isn't entirely fictional. Calogero (or C as he becomes known as later) is attracted by the mob way of life; him and his friends are constantly imitating Sonny and his crew. He likes the idea that they drive round in nice cars and that everyone fears them - it's believable, kids are impressionable so I could buy into the fact that Calogero would want a piece of the action. This becomes even more evident when Calogero makes an easy $600 dollars at the tender age of 9 when he started working for Sonny.Another aspect that I liked about this film is the characters and the depth that they are afforded; I felt sympathy for Lorenzo. There were many occasions where Lorenzo felt that he was losing his son to Sonny - Calogero was attracted to the mob way of life - the money, the cars, the power, the fear. How can he compete on the measly wage that he earns? Lorenzo can't offer his son the things that Sonny can offer him. This made me care for his character and whilst I don't have kids myself, I could empathise with his character and I can understand that he will do everything he can to protect his son. Even Sonny becomes some what likable towards the end - again all the characters are given 'human qualities'.A Bronx Tale also features a strong narrative (in the mould of Goodfellas - I also felt that this film had a touch of Once upon a time in America about it as well). Although it has elements of the aforementioned films, it differs for me in the fact that it focuses more on the conflict that C faces between Lorenzo and Sonny - Lorenzo is his father, but he sees Sonny as a father figure as well. Both Lorenzo and Sonny are on hand to give C advice, but more often than not he chooses to take Sonny's advice over his own father's advice. Goodfellas and OUTIA focused more on the rise within the mob as opposed to ABT focusing more on the conflict that being in a mob can cause within a family - this made A Bronx Tale more of a human story. Now I'm not criticising Goodfellas and OUATIA as I love both of those films, I'm just pointing out that this is a different kind of good mob film.Robert De Niro (like Clint Eastwood) has proved that he is just as good behind the camera as he is in front of it. His direction was superb (the only time it was really a problem was during the bar brawl with the bikers - the camera work for this particular scene wasn't great if I'm honest) In summary, this is a fantastic mob film which has a good narrative and also proves to be an excellent character study. A Bronx Tale is a film I would strongly recommend to everyone.",

An example of this would be when Sonny gave Calogero a test to see if the girl he liked was a good kind of girl that he could always have by his side.One thing they could have done better at was to include some other people in the story.

I actually liked Robert De Niro as the straight-laced father, Chazz Palminteri is a spot-on mob boss, and I can even appreciate the somewhat cliched New Yorker performance from Lillo Brancato. Most of the rest of the ingredients thrown together to make this film don't work for me, though. I struggle a great deal with all gangster movies. I can't sympathize with the crooks, and don't find myself rooting for them in any way. Taking a kid and getting him tangled up in their wrongdoing just makes me worry about him and eventually lose sympathy for his situation as he gets himself deeper into the situation.The worst part about A Bronx Tale is that it teased me for a little bit in the first act and had me convinced I was in for a different type of movie. I thought there was going to be a morality tale built in there, and we'd learn how De Niro was always in the right, so the kid should have listened to his father. Instead the film comes dangerously close to condoning the criminal activities of Palminteri's character and his lackeys. By the end it makes it seem like he was a noble man deserving of the protagonist's adoration. There are moments I enjoyed in A Bronx Tale, but it certainly wasn't the type of film I am ever going to watch again. There was a better direction they might have taken that I would have liked, but they simply weren't interested in telling that story.",

            "review_title": "A Bronx Tale is an unforgettable coming-of-age gangster film with values, with a great directional debut and performances, thanks to the brilliant and realistic writing",
            "content": "A Bronx Tale is a gangster and coming of age film which I have wanted to see for many years, and it met my expectations. The film is directed and produced by Robert De Niro, and based on Chazz Palminteri's play. Robert De Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, intent on making the play his directorial debut. The duo then worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Notable actors and performances are Robert De Niro as Lorenzo, Chazz Palminteri as \"Sonny\", Lillo Brancato, Jr. And Francis Capra as Calogero, Taral Hicks, Kathrine Narducci and Joe Pesci. I have to say Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri is spectacular in their roles, the latter being my favorite of the leads. Both actors who play Calogero are great! This film actually launched Palminteri's acting career, I've seen him in some films and TV, notably Godfather of Harlem and The Usual Suspects which shows off his phenomenal acting.After witnessing a murder in front of his house, nine-year-old Calogero forms a strong and lasting bond with the Bronx' local gangster Sunny, in spite of his father, Lorenzo's, disapproval. A Bronx Tale delivers a closer inspection of father/son relations, life choices and their consequences. There's a subplot which is full with life and written so well, about Calogero's romantic life.For a directional debut, Robert De Niro does everything right, and you can clearly see who taught him, Martin Scorsese that is. I just love how passionate he was with this project, the story and wanting it to be as true to the source material as possible, even casting Chazz Palminteri as \"Sonny\". Chazz's real name is actually Calogero and this story is autobiographical. It just says so much as a producer and director on Robert De Niro's side, such great work! This might have been one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen, maybe it's because of my love for Robert De Niro as an actor and for the gangster genre. But everything feels so real, so human, it's just brilliantly and beautiful written. The themes De Niro brings up in this film is perfect and executed as good. Roger Ebert wrote this in his review which I can only agree with. \"A Bronx Tale is a very funny movie sometimes, and very touching at other times. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values.\" In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list, worthy of a place I might add but there are so many excellent gangster films.",

As an average movie watcher, this is one of the most emotional movies I have watched.What sticks out for me is the amazing soundtrack, which can really capture the emotion of the scenes, and what I think is an excellent performance by Chazz Palminteri, Robert De Niro, and Lillo Brancato. I wouldn't agree with people expecting it to be another \"Goodfellas\" or \"Godfather\", cause this movie is in a category of its own. It is an excellent coming of age story, and you really feel as though you grow up with Calogero(Lillo Brancato) and there is a strong emotional connection to the characters Sonny, a crime boss who takes Calogero under his wing(Chazz Palminteri), and Lorenzo, Calogero's father(Robert De Niro). Now I wouldn't consider this a spoiler, but the ending is probably the most emotional ending I have seen, and it left me so proud of the movie that it motivated me to write this review (My first review). I highly recommend this movie to everyone, whether or not you love gangster films, because I really feel as though it is a gangster movie, the plot involves more of the coming of age of Lillo Brancato's character, and less of the gangster aspect of the story. From what I understand there is also a Broadway play, and I would expect that to be golden as well, but overall PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE, it is that good. There are tons of amazing quotes and scenes and this movie leaves you with a deep lesson, which I really didn't experience in Godfather or Goodfellas, but I still consider those movies to be top notch. For this I applaud Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri and all the actors involved with this picture, and I hope that more people see this movie and really appreciate it.",

He seemed wise but at the same time an emotionally unstable punk. Good production values; it kept you going with the doo-wop and 60's rock soundtrack. Some parts were questionable - no explanation was ever given for the disappearance of C's mother eight years later. When the bikers got beaten up in the bar by a bunch of fat, middle-aged Italians, it didn't seem credible. Biker gang members are tough guys and they got beaten up as if they were defenseless children. C and his friends all wore hats, but I was also in high school in 1968 and nobody wore one of those stupid Frank Sinatra hats. Maybe a knit cap , but that's it. The commentary that DeNiro's character was poor even though he was a municipal bus driver for over ten years was not credible. Bus divers made a decent wage back then. I even know of one who became a millionaire by investing in property. The racism angle was realistic. Neighborhoods were defined by race and there was a lot of mistrust and hatred. The romance between C and Jane seemed believable. Good movie - I would recommend it.",

It looks like a typical gangster movie, I would even say that it is predictable at times, but the movie has a strong story, characters and relationships between them. De Niro is playing literally the complete opposite of what he has done many times in his career, so I found it a bit unusual. The actor who plays his son physically looks overwhelmingly like De Niro's younger version. A film about education, crime, consequences, racism, own choices in life, many topics are squeezed into the barely two hours of the film. Palminteri did a great job in his role as the boss, and I'm sorry that De Niro didn't have a slightly different role, but he's probably nicer in that too. At the end, we have a great cameo role that fits this movie perfectly and I liked it a lot. Definitely a recommendation for filmmakers.",

A person like this becomes so dependent on others because he was raised to keep his mouth shut and just tag along. If this is semi-biographical at least Chaz Palminteri had the guts to show how limited his mind was, because his character seems really dumb. Lilo Brancato is not the best actor in the world, that's for sure, and he made the character look even dumber, especially with the way he walked. De Niro and Palminteri both play their roles well, but no one shines, basically the whole movie could have been better if it were sharper.

In his directorial debut, he directs and also plays the part of a loving yet stern father figure who you sometimes feel bad for. It is this story of life growing up in a neighborhood run by a crime boss and how a mans son is almost dragged too deep into it.A Bronx Tale features Chazz Palminteri as the crime boss known as Sonny. Sonny makes Calogero (Lillo Brancato), or as he calls him 'C', his new apprentice. 's father is Lorenzo played by De Niro who doesn't like Sonny and how he runs things. He especially doesn't want his own son being involved in that kind of life. 'C' has been around Sonny since he was nine years old, shooting craps in Sonny's basement. Sonny is now 17 and learning a few tips here and there on how things work in the neighborhood. It's fear that gives Sonny respect and gives him control over the area. 'C' is also forced into some uncomfortable situations with his nitwit friends who want nothing more than to be like Sonny no matter what the cost. When a skirmish between the the nearby black community and these guys, it makes a turn for the worse when 'C' watches his friends beat up some black teenagers. To make matters worse, 'C' has a little crush on a girl at school who happens to be black. He sees nothing wrong with that, other than the fact that no one would accept them in his group. They must keep their love a secret.De Niro does a wonderful job directing this picture. He uses narration by 'C' throughout the entire movie to make it a first-person experience. The story told through his eyes is one that is gripping and keeps you enthralled. Palmintiri is wonderful as Sonny who at times is as kind hearted as a lamb, but then will pounce on you in a second. Sonny's power over the community is brought on by fear. His ability to make a grown man tremble when he looks at you makes him the man he is. The only person who isn't afraid is Lorenzo. They grew up together and know each other, but they do not see eye to eye on much. De Niro's acting in this role is well done. His title of 'C's father figure is slipping away it seems towards Sonny and it eats away at Lorenzo. The conflict with these three men is showcased wonderfully.The story of A Bronx Tale is one that is very entertaining and fulfilling. It shows how one decision you make is the difference between life and death. There are many good lessons to be learned for 'C' in this movie that even can be associated with life today, such as don't get involved with the wrong crowd and listen to your parents. A Bronx Tale is the perfect blend of drama and action that could be compared to Goodfellas. As Lorenzo says, \"The saddest thing in life is wasted talent,\". To overlook this movie is just that.",

With the exception of the collapse of the Yankee Dynasty, time has stopped in that part of the Bronx, and few are willing to accept anything different, like the idea of co-existing with Afro-Americans, the arrival of a standard motorcycle gang, and though not mentioned in the movie, the noble efforts of Robert Moses to solve New York's traffic problems. Our hero nearly gets killed by his own men as they beat up the motorcycle gang who barge in on their turf. He also gets a lot of grief from his peers for falling in love with a girl from a black neighborhood, and some additional grief from that girl and her friends for being in the company of such bigots.Much like \"Dead Presidents,\" and \"Everybody's All-American,\" it's a period-piece with no real point that still catches your interest. It draws you in with nostalgia, picks up a lot of steam, but suddenly falls flat. This doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. It just leaves you wanting a little more from it.

All of those elements make A Bronx Tale an amazing movie that is Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri at their best.Based on Chazz Palminteri's one man stage play of the same name and set during the 1960s,A Bronx Tale tells the story of a young man named Cologero(Lillo Brancato,Francis Capra)who is torn between the love for his Bus Driver Father Lorenzo(Robert De Niro)and smooth talking gangster Sonny(Chazz Palminteri). As Cologero goes from his childhood to his teenager years Cologero has to deal with his love and admiration for his Father and Sonny as well as growing up.Released in 1993,A Bronx Tale is a brilliant and unforgettable film that marked the directorial debut of actor Robert De Niro and he could not have picked a better project as his debut giving viewers one of the most underrated movies of all-time. I love the Coming Of Age movie genre because with any Coming Of Age film whether it's a Comedy or a Drama the genre deals with growing up and A Bronx Tale is one of the best of the genre because it mixes together a movie about growing up with Gangsters,violence and gritty streetwise dialog. A Bronx Tale is a movie that is dramatic and meaningful,intense and gripping and at times funny and humorous and it's those elements that make the movie amazing and watchable for 122 minutes because when you watch the film you as a viewer you feel like you are in the Bronx in the 1960s thanks to it's characters. With A Bronx Tale you are taken back to a different time and place. A Bronx Tale is also a movie that is deep and realistic mainly because there is lessons about morality and wasted talent(a common theme that runs throughout the film)while also dealing with themes such as family,love and friendship but is done with a harder edge. The movie also deals with themes such as racism and violence that was going on during the 1960s and it's done in a brutal way that was honest to the times. What makes A Bronx Tale a fascinating movie is the movie's three main characters Cologero,Lorenzo and Sonny. Cologero(the fictional version of Chazz Palmenteri)is a great character that we see going from child to a young adult having to grow up fast whether it's dealing his Father Lorenzo or his friend Sonny or the influence of his neighborhood or his friends with tons of struggles and danger. Sonny is a classic character and Gangster because while he's not necessarily a nice guy and he does some bad things he manages to be a likable person because he's smart with tons of depth. While Cologero loves Sonny and his Gangster lifestyle Sonny tells Coleogero not to be like him and try to survive with an education and smarts rather than have a gun. Cologero's Father Lorenzo is the polar opposite of Sonny's Gangster image because Lorenzo is a bus driver that is a working man that loves his son and tries to teach him about not wasting his talents and not to live the life style that Sonny lives by walking the wrong path. With Cologero,Sonny and Lorenzo it's not about a tug of war between Sonny and Lorenzo over Cologero but about two men trying to raise Cologero on the straight and narrow. A Bronx Tale is often seen as a Gangster film and while A Bronx Tale owes a lot to the genre(such as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas which was an influence on this film)it's not a Gangster film in a tradition sense as it is more about a young man's conflicts than a group of Gangsters. The violence in A Bronx Tale is brutal and in your face but works and makes an impact when the violence happens. The screenplay by Chazz Palmenteri is terrific and memorable with dialog that is gritty and truthful. Palmenteri based A Bronx Tale on himself and his real life experiences on growing up in the Bronx and when you watch the movie,the characters or hear the dialog everything feels accurate. The ending in A Bronx Tale is outstanding because it gives viewers lessons about life,humanity and bringing the film's themes full circle. A terrific ending.The cast is wonderful. Robert De Niro is excellent and memorable as Lorenzo,a Bus Driver that loves his son. Chazz Palminteri is brilliant and unforgettable as Sonny,with Palminteri being smooth and captivating. Lillo Brancato is terrific as Calogero and has great scenes with De Niro and Palminteri. Francis Capra is wonderful as Young Calogero(Age 9)with Capra bringing the right emotions. Taral Hicks is great and beautiful as Jane,Cologero's love interest. Kathrine Narducci is good and sexy as Rosina,Lorenzo's wife. Clem Caserta does a fine job as Jimmy Whispers,Sonny's right hand man. Joe D'Onofrio(Slick),Louis Vanana(Crazy Mario),Luigi D'Angelo(Aldo)and Dominick Rocchio(Ralphie)do great jobs as Cologero's friends. Joe Pesci is terrific in his cameo role as Carmine an old friend of Sonny.The direction by Robert De Niro is sensational,with De Niro always moving the camera and giving the film a style that is simple but effective. Great direction,De Niro.The soundtrack is outstanding with a collection of classic Rock N'Roll songs that fit the movie perfectly. Amazing soundtrack.In final word,if you love Robert De Niro,Chazz Palminteri or Coming of Age films I highly suggest you see A Bronx Tale,an excellent,powerful and underrated classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "I wasn't positive that Robert De Niro's directorial debut was necessarily going to be a good one. After all, a great actor does not automatically translate into a great director. But there was no need to worry. 'A Bronx Tale' grabbed hold of me from its opening moments and held me in sway throughout.The screenplay was based on a play by Chazz Palminteri, which surprised me, since the movie moves along briskly and the dialog is never too wordy. Oftentimes when watching an adaptation of a play a moment will occur early on when the characters stand there and talk just a bit too long and you realize the work's origins, but this never happened here.Palminteri also stars as the neighborhood mob boss who takes an interest in a local boy who refused to identify him to police after a murder is committed. The boy, Calogero, or C, is the story's narrator and De Niro plays his father, a bus driver who already has had enough trouble keeping his son away from the lure of the flashy life and easy money that the mob promises. Now his task is even harder.One thing that De Niro the director has going for him is De Niro the actor. He plays one of the most heroic characters I've ever seen as the working man trying to raise a son and keep his family safe in an environment that threatens to corrupt them. This film does more to promote family values than any of the self-righteous, morally superior demagogues who supposedly preach such values today.De Niro obviously learned a lot from working with masters like Martin Scorsese, but he deserves credit for his own skills as well. He might not have complete command of all the directorial techniques Scorsese has, but I honestly enjoyed this picture more than 'Goodfellas.' I think the use of the period's popular songs is done better in 'A Bronx Tale' than in the other film.As some have noted, the interracial love interest might have been unlikely at the time but it's not beyond the realm of possibility and in any case we can allow for a little artistic license. Lillo Brancato and Francis Capra also star as Calogero at ages 17 and 9, respectively. Even if you are tired of mob-themed movies and think you've heard enough Italian-American accents to last a lifetime, you might want to give 'A Bronx Tale' a try anyway; it's that good. Give it five stars or 10 on a scale of 10, this is a first-rate film.",

Bravo.Overall the film felt like a poorly executed attempt at a gangster film that was just too hokey, disjointed and forced to be taken seriously.5/10 stars is a generous rating.",

            "content": "This film is based on Chazz Palmintieri's childhood growing up in the Bronx in the '60s. I found it a loving, often insightful movie, but I did think that likelihood that Palmintieri's C (excellently depicted by Lilo Brancato and Francis Capra) was so rebellious and close to mob boss Sonny (Chazz Palmintieri) at age nine made it surprising that he was still as close to his father (Robert DeNiro as honest bus driver Lorenzo) at the end of the movie.The music, the setting, and the acting are all very good. The music captures a selection of some great doo-wop and then, as the decade continues, some rock. One gets a sense of the Bronx at that time which, from reading comments here, evokes the time and place quite accurately. The film is directed by Robert DeNiro and it's clear his collaboration with Martin Scorsese has influenced him in his use of music, his depiction of complex characters, and a story which keeps the viewer interested. Robert DeNiro is great as a decent, humble man. Chazz Palmintieri depicts a gangster who does care about his neighborhood, and Taral Hicks is great as a girl with whom C falls in love across the barricades. Very entertaining movie, but I did think that it would have been interesting to track C as he grew up so that we could see how he remained close to his father through the years.",

Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri reach deep down and bring to life the core essence of that internal struggle of direction faced by many youth when told to just do the right thing but never told what the right thing is.Growing up poor with parents that make an honest living, Colagero (C) tries to understand his father's life lessons but can't contain his ever increasing curiosity and reverence for the local thugs. After C witnesses a crime and responses to it the way the streets taught him, the neighborhood enforcer (Sunny) takes Colagero under his wing to teach a few life lessons of his own. The methods of each role model may be different but the message is the same.. There are consequences for compromising on integrity and values.For C this fact is something that isn't easily understood without living it first hand. He struggles to balance the only 2 futures presented a neighborhood boy growing up in the Bronx which are a safe mundane pseudo existence or an exciting fast paced lifestyle of money, power and respect.",

When a scene featured his father, jazz music played.  Since jazz is usually considered intelligent music, I took this as pointing out the wisdom that the father possessed.  Rat-Pack tunes accompanied Sonny the Mob boss, and his partners in crime; music that reflected love, but played on the tavern jukebox by folks who practiced fear and intimidation.What I didn't get is that the African-American girl would have an \"all is forgiven\" attitude toward the young man near the end of the movie.  Yes, he saved her brother from getting serious injuries in a racially motivated attack by his friends, but the young man called her brother a ethnic slur in front of her.  Also, the young man's mother just seems to disappear after the first hour of the film.Otherwise, this is a good directorial effort from Mr. DeNiro.",

The boss's criminal background and close ties to Cologino, causes the boy's father (Robert Deniro) much concern and there is a constant struggle between these two 'fathering' figures.

The story is genuine, the dialogue is fluent, and the characters are well thought out.The acting is great. Robert De Niro, Chazz Palminteri, Lillo Brancato, Francis Capra, and Taral Hicks all perform well. I would have like more scenes with Robert De Niro only because he brings such power a vigor to the scene. The cameo by Joe Pesci is also great.The pacing is a little slow but it is done in a way that makes us connect with the characters and the world in the film. The runtime is a bit overlong as well.Pros: Complex story, fluent dialogue, great acting, Joe Pesci cameo, and well thought out charactersCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and I wish there were more scenes with Robert De NiroOverall Rating: 8.4P.S. This film belongs among the ranks of the greatest gangster films of all time such as: The Godfather Part 1 and 2, Casino, Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and Gangs of New York.",

            "content": "I finally saw this film for the first time last week.  Knowing my extreme interest in mafia-related movies, this film was recommended to me by many sources. I really had no idea what to expect. Unlike the Godfather Trilogy, which show you the intricate interworkings of the mafia, this movie is really an introductory to mafia life ---- Mafia 101, if you'd like. It's seen though the eyes of a young Italian boy named Calogero. Not to repeat what's been said in every other review, but Calogero lives in Little Italy, New York. His neighborhood is a hangout for the mafia, headed by a man named Sonny.   One day, Calogero witnesses a shooting by Sonny, but refuses to turn him into the police. I particularly liked the scene where the boy was brought to look at a lineup of hoodlums, to pick out who the \"shooter was\". When he came to Sonny there was a long gaze between Calogero and the \"mafia king\". But the boy didn't turn him in. After that, Sonny befriended the boy --- and became a second father. Through the years, there was a battle between Sonny & Calagero's real father (played amazingly by Robert DeNiro). Of course the father didn't want Calogero hanging out with those types of people. A side story involved the battle between black & white neighborhoods --- and Calogero falling in love with a black girl from the \"wrong side of the tracks\". Personally, I thought this girl (Jean) could've been more likeable. She didn't seem like anyone you would risk your life to walk home.This movie has a surprising & sad ending --- which I won't tell you in case you haven't seen it. All things considered, this was one of the best movies I've seen. Definitely one that I could watch over & over again. And a definite must for my video collection.",

You're still developing your morals and sense of the world, and young children are highly impressionable. When surrounded by crime your entire life it's not so easy to realize what's good in the world, especially when criminals are being praised. People in power are either loved or feared. As this Bronx tale goes, love is beyond this world. It's laying your life down for someone without expecting nor wanting anything in return. It means your life exists past your physical death. Throughout the movie, Calogero is being told by his father and Sonny to get an education. To build a life worth living since they understand wealth is not love; money only establishes fear and that's not the type of life they wish upon others. For Sonny, fear has become a way of life he can no longer escape and for Lorenzo (the father), it's something he ensures his family avoids. The world can be both a beautiful and scary place. We try not to grow up too fast but it's inevitable. We can only try and be the best selves we can be.

It actually had a good plot, decent acting(I'll get to that later), and some scenes that are kind of hard to forget.  Now what I couldn't believe was that this movie was Robert DeNiro's directorial debut.  I think that as a director he must learn from only a few flaws from this movie.  One mistake that just stands out to me is the casting of Tarel Hicks as Jane.  God damn, now that is horrible acting, how the hell did Robert DeNiro not notice this when he was making the movie? Something else he should learn not to do is to cast people in a major role that he just happened to see at a beach doing an impression of him.  Now don't get me wrong, Lillo Brancato wasn't THAT bad but I don't think he should have had such a major role that he couldn't handle that well.

Having portrayed a range of mobsters across the years, from Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part 2, and only three years earlier in Goodfellas, as Jimmy Conway, he stands to present the honesty of such an Italian-American stereotype within the Bronx in a more personal manner to his and Chazz Palmienteri's childhood and upbringing, whereby fathers worked selflessly to endlessly provide for their families; a true dutiful meta-narrative.The story is powerful! The characters intricate! The production design and cinematography; realistic and beautifully detailed! It is a wonderful film, and being De Niro's directorial debut, it stands as a true great of cinema much like Scorsese's feature film debut of Mean Streets in 1973. Even in the 21st century, these characters and narratives are still relatable, and with the growing surge of youth independence, immaturity, and irresponsibility, this film presents the honesties of life, the effect of respect and true loving responsibility, alongside the moral values that lead to true development into adulthood.This film is an undeniable great, and above all, truly personal!

Though this is not his best acting, it is really good (but its hard to beat some of his other roles.) Chazz Palminteri also did a great job on both acting and writing. Lillo Brancato, who played 17 year old Calogero wasn't a great choice in my opinion. He looked the part and occasionally did alright but for the most part I think his acting was rather poor. This was a completely different gangster movie than we usually see, from Scorsese or whoever. It still shows the life that gangster live but it is more about living on the edge of becoming a gangster and living a more respectable life. Following a boy who has to decide to follow the foot steps of his father or his role model. It's deeper than most other movies of the genre as well in some ways. Because it's dealing with moral issues and more problems than your average gangster might face. Conflicts between Father and other role models, racial issues, peer pressure, and of course, the parking space.It's an important film to watch if you are into gangster movies, it gives a new perspective. It is no Godfather, or Goodfellas, but its still and excellent movie. If you enjoy gangster movies and/or Robert De Niro you should like this one. 9/10",

            "content": "The fascinating thing about this movie is that it cannot simply be classified as yet one another MAFIA gangster story. It is much more than that. In its core, it is a film about allurements and moral issues that a young kid of rather poor descent is facing when growing up in an environment as wild and colorful like the Bronx of the 1960's.On the one hand, the young kid Calogero, the main character, is very much attracted by the sovereignty of Sunny, head of the local MAFIA chapter, whom he does not sell to the police after witnessing Sunny shooting someone on the street. On the other hand, he also feels respect (not always) for his honest father, the bus driver, who does not want to be drawn into the MAFIA affairs and at the same time tries to prevent his son from being drawn into these. This is conflict number one.Both father figures are plaid in a very impressive manner. It is interesting to see Robert de Niro (who also directed the movie) performing very well also in the unusual role as an honest and modest family father whereas Chazz Palminteri (who also wrote the semi-autobiographic screenplay) almost manages to define his part of the big Mafioso as a new benchmark.In conflict number two Calogero has to find his way through his feelings towards a black girl and the hateful attitude of his Italian environment towards the black community in the neighborhood. Hence, the film also serves as a good vehicle to show the great racism issues of the time.There is a few more wise things in the movie that add to its quality like Sunny talking about Machiavelli's theory about availability or Calogero's father talking about wasted talent being the saddest thing in life or tests on whether to dump a girl or not.Unfortunately the film also has a few disturbing elements in it that do not allow it to be among my personal front-runners.**The acting performance of 17-year-old Calogero cannot keep up with the rest of the movie. **The love story between Jane and Calogero is not very convincing. Why should beautiful Jane be attracted by 17-year-old Calogero who is no more than a mediocre guy with a strange hat who is constantly staring at her? **The narrator describes the rockers in the bar beforehand as wild People who are used to bar fights but then they are beaten up by Sunny's loyalty like little boys. **The young Italian fellows of Calogero are pictured in a too simplistic and one-dimensional way. Do young guys really have nothing more in their minds than impressing the world by being ignorant and violent! If so the scene with them throwing their Afro-American district neighbors off their bikes and beating them up is not unnecessary brutal but otherwise ...Besides these flaws, it was maybe also the multiple layers that exist in the movie that prevented it from being a best seller at the cinema box office (if quality has something to do with sales figures at all).On a final note, I also want to mention the beautiful gospel-like theme song right at the beginning and the end of the movie. Besides its beauty it also serves as a perfect vehicle to drive us away quickly from our real environments on to the Bronx of the 1960's.",

            "review_title": "One of the most authentic gangster dramas with a solid script, powerful directing, and brilliant acting",
            "content": "Each great gangster drama offers a unique perspective on the criminal world in general and on what it means to be a gangster in particular.After watching \"The Godfather\", people might think that being a prominent gangster means being a clever strategist, playing an adrenaline-filled, violent power game with many lives at stake, a seasoned warrior, sacrificing almost everything for the sake of the \"family\" winning the game.After watching \"Scarface\", people might think that being a prominent gangster means being an extremely dangerous, crafty, and lucky beast, whose strong intuition and unsurpassed surviving instincts help to ruthlessly devour the less lucky inferior beasts in the explosive acts of a powerful bestial rage.While \"A Bronx Tale\" might not have the epic dramatic intensity of \"The Godfather\", or the exuberant energy, tension, and drive of \"Scarface\", or the mysterious tragic depth of \"Once Upon a Time in America\", it has that unique perspective that makes a good gangster movie great.One of the key strengths of the film is its authenticity and realism. With all the great competition from the gangster movie masterpieces, \"A Bronx Tale\" might be one of the closest to capturing the essence of a gangster life and avoiding a dangerous trap of its glamorization and generating any unhealthy excitement about it.The movie skillfully shows that while some violence, some strategy, some rage, and some family values do have their place in a life of a gangster, their significance has been grossly exaggerated by the popular culture.According to \"A Bronx Tale\", a typical gang member (and even a crime boss) unsurprisingly leads a boring, meaningless, shallow life dominated by fear and a fundamental inability to trust anybody. At the center of the movie is a principal (although mostly indirect) confrontation between a local crime boss, Sonny (Chazz Palminteri, in a powerful and perfectly convincing performance) who befriends a neighborhood kid, and the father of the kid \u2013 a local bus driver Lorenzo (Robert De Niro, at his best). True to its focus on realism and authenticity, \"A Bronx Tale\" does not make Lorenzo a hero, a wise charismatic leader, or a saint without blemish. Lorenzo is a good ordinary man who loves his son, sincerely tries to raise him well, and finds courage to try to shield him from the influence of the gang.A screenplay by Chazz Palminteri skillfully tells a colorful, touching tale full of vibrant realism and serves as a solid, reliable backbone for the movie. While a purist might find some minor issues here and there, (a crime boss citing Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli seemed to be a little far-fetched to me) the script is simply outstanding. I am quite sure that ninety-nine percent of the Hollywood screenplay writers will never ever create anything remotely close in quality to this excellent work and therefore should be forever jealous of it.A directorial debut of Robert De Niro was a brilliant success. Oh, how I wish that instead of wasting his talent on the endless \"Fockers\" sequels and such, he would consider directing more movies and continue exploring this mostly uncharted dimension of his enormous talent.A great actor himself, Robert De Niro was simply amazing in working with the actors on the scene. Under his guidance, all the actors, both well known and unknown, showed such an extraordinary combination of depth and subtleness in reflecting human feelings and emotions, that the only word that comes to mind is \"magic\". It was a pure magic, created by a genius - Robert De Niro.If you did not see \"A Bronx Tale\" before, I would highly recommend giving it a chance and watching it, maybe even together with your responsible, mature teenage kids, despite the well-deserved \"R\" rating. \"A Bronx Tale\" is not a family movie; it has some strong violence and bad language in it, but it is free from sexually explicit scenes and has surprisingly a lot to say about family values: protecting the loved ones, making wise choices, being faithful, resisting a bad influence, maintaining dignity under difficult circumstances, being respectful, truthful, and accountable.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",

When my husband suggested watching A Bronx Tale I intended to see much of the same bloodshed.  I was to be pleasantly surprised.This wonderful movie quickly drew me in with its sensitive portrayal of its father and son and the soon to be introduced conflict of the relationship developed between the son and the local mob boss.Many reviewers have retold the story and so I will not waste time with another rehash.  In the end it is a film full of love and sensitivity and a new, fresh look at the possibility that a Mafia boss can care and love a boy who does not share his blood and want the best for him and knows that the best is not to \"be him\".  C has the good fortune to have two men care deeply about his well being and his future.  How many children are in this world who have no one who cares about how they turn out.Robert DeNiro proves that he is not only a gifted actor, but a wonderful, sensitive director with a keen sense of storytelling.  And what can you say about Chazz Palminteri's story and screenplay which is a reflection of his own youth?  Amazing.What started out as a \"I'll sit through this movie because my husband wants to see it\" turned into a memorable two hours.  I'll watch it again and will recommend it to anyone who will listen.  Bravo gentlemen!",

            "content": "What a delight.A Bronx Tale is one of those movies that will take your soul for a ride into another world. I grew up in Southern California, but Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri gave me a special gift with this movie. They shared all they loved about growing up in the sixties in New York.Everyone knows that just above the reality of a time and place there lies the surreal and beautiful image it leaves in your mind. Most refer to these memories as the good old days. You know, when you think back at a time you treasure and you forget the pain and the ugliness and all that remains is what made gave it it's magic.We have all enjoyed the films of DeNiro, Scorcese, and their extended neighborhood of filmmakers, and we have heard them talk about their good old days in a place most outsiders fear. Well, Palminteri has crafted a beautiful picture of those days and DeNiro has brought it to life with this wonderful film about morality in a place where immorality was beginning to take hold.DeNiro paints a vision of the Bronx in the good old days, not as it actually was, I suspect, but how it seemed to the young boy who grew into the young man who narrates the film.Told from this boy's perspective, we are whisked through a magical tour of the boy's whole world, the neighborhood. He also introduces us in a hilarious sequence to all of the larger than life neighborhood wiseguys.We grow up with our young protagonist as we all grew up. We see him lose his innocence as the world moves into and his mind reaches out of their small urban paradise.Set to the enchanting and beautifully chosen music of the time and place, we see young Calogero deal with the world around him with the help of the simple hard working moral father played by DeNiro and the King of the neighborhood Sonny, (Chazz Palminteri).One important part of the movie is the tug of war between the father and the godfather over Calogero. They both love the boy, but The Father sees Sonny as immoral and a doorway to Calogero's ruin. What the father can't do however is compete with the power and glamour of Sonny. I mean he is the one guy that everyone \"Loves\" and he chooses Calogero as someone special to him. The boy is drawn to him like a magnet, partially out of hero worship, partially because it gets the neighborhood thrown at his feet, and partially because he really loves and respects him.This leads to another magical part of the film. Sonny is quite a character. A murderer who isn't all that bad. What do I mean by that? He chose his path early on, and then outgrew it. He stepped into a world of intimidation and violence and grew to hate it, but couldn't walk away now if he tried. A man who is held hostage by his power. He can never trust anyone; he lives his life that he has grown to see as beautiful and full, while knowing he is on borrowed time. He tries very hard to let Calogero know that world is out there, and that the world of gangsters is not the one the boy should choose.A very good scene paints this out for us. Calogero asks Sonny if it is better to be loved or feared. He answers to the effect that it is better to be loved, but that he in his position, he has to choose feared. \"It lasts longer\"Another pearl of wisdom we get from the immoral moralist is when addressing the blossoming romance with the Nubian beauty Jane played by Taral Hicks. When asked if it was okay for him to date a black girl when all the people around him would be very much against it, Sonny says, \"When it is just the two of you together that is all that matters\".A Bronx Tale is a very under-appreciated masterpiece. It is a movie that will make you think, while it moves you through a beautiful urban dream.",

Little Calogero, later \"C\" witnesses the neighborhood godfather, \"Sonny\" kill someone and refuses to identify him to the police, after which Sonny takes him under his wing and takes a liking to him as his own in order to teach him his own ways and thinking.\"The working man is a sucker,\" his son learns from Sonny, while his dad has to teach him that the working man is the true hero by taking care of his family and never has to look over his shoulder.Little \"C\" participates in the gangsters' crapshoot game garners a lot of money in tips, which his father finds, and gives it back to Sonny, even to the dismay of his wife, as they are poor and could really use the money.The music entries are executed superbly! Lorenzo (DeNiro) listens to the jazz station on his portable radio, which would have better to have used actual recordings from the '60s Blue Note and Prestige library, instead of using newer recordings made to sound vintage. The soundtrack had no trouble getting the licensing permission to use original '50s and '60s pop recordings, so why not use original jazz recordings? But in the scene on the bus where he first sees his love interest and can't take his eyes off her, they segue from some smooth jazz from the bus driver's radio, to Wilson Pickett's \"Ninety-Nine and a Half,\" which is blasting from the local record shop when they reach the black neighborhood. Later, when C is getting ready for his date with his new love (played by the lovelyTaral Hicks), he looks into the mirror and snaps his fingers to kick off the drums of \"Baby, I Need Your Loving\" by the Four Tops into the next scene. I love that kind of editing and splicingI\nIn spite of the violent scenes, the biker scene in the bar, and the Italian youngsters' rage over their black peers riding their bikes through their neighborhood and then later paying for it with their lives, the movie has many touching moments and good morals to teach.

I was used to be called \"C\" by my friends as well, exactly same as \"C\" in the movie. It seems that I find myself sometimes when watching the movie. Admired the cool guys or gangsters since I was a child. Respecting our father no matter when, because we trust them, we are proud of them. Being very shy when falling love with a girl but daring to do everything to get her. \"C\" is not a gangster, not a bad guy, he gets a great deal of conscience. Sunny is the boss of local gangster, everyone fears him, but also some of them respect him. What the difference between Sunny and other gangsters is he knows exactly the life, so he insists that \"C\" should not repeat his life rather than taking over from him.Secondly this movie also reflects the serious discrimination in American. Black people and white guys are water and fire. However \"C\" bravely steps out of the red line when he came across his love. He loves the girl without discrimination although he grew up in an environment teaching him to spite colour people.Finally, as said in the movie that you will understand when you grow up, it's a long way to go, from ignorant to knowledgeable, it is a process of life. You don't need to know what is this, what is going on right now, why it happens or what we should do at the very present time. But you need to make sure you will understand one day when you grow up. Like this word, \"it's easy to make people fear of you but it's not easy to make them respect you. Only when they respect you, you are the real boss.",

Sonny was given much more dimension than just the dangerous man Calogero was not supposed to spend time with. Funny, thoughtful and wise, his fatherly connection with 'C' gives a more humanly depiction to an otherwise intimidating gangster. Palminteri was excellent in this role.Of course, De Niro delivers a wonderful performance too. He tries to teach his son not to respect or admire the gangsters he sees on the streets, as they aren't the real tough guys. Playing a bus driver, he represents the working man - who his son is convinced are the suckers of the world. Although it takes many years and a few tragedies along the way for Calogero to comprehend this, he finally comes to respect his father.Alongside Calogero's leap to manhood, the film also depicts young love, peer pressure, and the racial tension simmering between Italians and Blacks during the 1960's.Small things I liked: The Car Door Test, Calogero going to confession, Sunny reversing the car and a young Calogero imitating Sunny.I would have liked to have seen what Calogero's 'talent' amounted to, since this is one of the most recognised quotes of the movie, but maybe that's just me being picky.\nNevertheless, with music which compliments the mood of the film (expect iconic songs from Sinatra, The Kinks, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, The Beatles & The Flamingos)- A Bronx Tale is a major success for Robert De Niro's directorial debut.",

            "content": "I've only just seen this having managed not to for years. Its very good indeed and certainly kept me watching.However, I enjoyed the 1960 part more than the 1968 part. And it did seem a bit 'forced' at times. Also - why hasn't anyone else mentioned Goodfellas?! Just after it started I was thinking \"Goodfellas\" all the time. Its very similar indeed - especially at the start. Not that this in necessarily a bad thing but the resemblance was uncanny - and I notice this came out only 3 years after Goodfellas too! Having said all that, like I said above, I definitely enjoyed it. Not too long either. Nice cameo by Joe Pesci at the end too - which reinforced the Goodfellas thing even more of course! I also noticed a bit of a nod to Once Upon A Time in America from time to time too - again, not a bad thing at all.All in all - don't expect a 10/10 classic like Goodfellas or Once Upon A Time in America and just watch it with an open mind. I think some of the 10/10 reviews here are a little over the top. And its way better than anything De Niro has been in for the last 12 years of course (needless to say).",

            "content": "6 October 2000A Bronx Tale starring Robert DeNiro and Directed by Robert DeNiro. 1993 was the year he unveiled a hidden secret of his. His directorial debut feels like it's made by Scorsese which isn't surprising, he influenced many directors with his unprecedented detail to storytelling. Gangster films have a grittiness and hard-boiled presence that they own so dearly. Unfortunately this genre possesses the word repetition, certain movies feel too similar to each-other.The main protagonist is Calogero, a teenager living in the Bronx in the 60s. The character is not that interesting and his performance is just fine. In the beginning of the film we get introduced to a 9 year old version of Calogero, the child actor is infuriating to tolerate and his constant mischief only amplifies my frustration to a level that genuinely annoyed me. I understand that it's his role and it's all part of the story but there are so many negative aspects about this child's performance that can easily put someone off the film. Let me talk about one for instance, you'll have to put subtitles on because you can never understand a word this kid is saying, he is mumbling everything that comes out of his mouth. He also talks extremely fast so if you understand any of his lines whilst watching the film for the first time then I'll be surprised. An hour into it and finally we get to change time frame, 1960 to 1968. Calogero is now a 17 year old teenager, this version of the character is far superior, First of all you understand everything he's saying. He has a good emotional range, he can act well during heartfelt sequences and he is overall a better actor when compared to his predecessor.Robert DeNiro as usual is amazing and his sympathetic and concerned character is definitely the high spot of the film for me personally. The untouchable love he has for his son feels authentic and very legitimate. I felt sorry for him and all of his issues, stepping into his son's shoes and making his life easier was an idea I had in mind during the film. Chazz Palminteri was decent, it was an easy performance to pull off. He is used to having these types of roles constantly handed to him. The movie's plot is painfully average and it concludes with a terrible ending. The camerawork is special at times, especially the shots of Bronx during the night. That's about it when it comes to cinematography, the entire movie has a damp and unsettling look. It seems as if the colours have been faded out and it creates this rusty, metallic look to the scenery which is very ugly to look at. The racial discrimination was an interesting topic to delve into and I also enjoyed the story of our protagonist's black girlfriend, it was hard to have a girlfriend with a different colour of skin in the 60s. Racism was evolving and becoming a very serious matter. The segment of the intolerant teenagers gunning down the store filled with black people and then throwing molotovs to it so they could create a dangerous fire was adequate but when they got one of their molotovs thrown back at them it became quite intriguing. It was a classic example of \"what goes around, comes around\".The ending is terrible, it's an easy way out. We had a heated rivalry between Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palimentiri that was actually starting to amount to something vast and important but then one of them dies. Killing someone doesn't add anything interesting to the story, there's no proper meaning behind it. The gunman is unbelievably insignificant to the main plot. They cut away all the tension because of a useless death scene that results to nothing. I would've preferred if our protagonist chose himself the person he wanted to stick to instead of some purposeless scene automatically do the job for him. An unsatisfactory ending that leaves me dispirited. It's a happy ending for my favourite character but the lead up to the cherished moment was very badly doneI moderately recommend A Bronx Tale, Robert DeNiro's character is great and the racial discrimination was intriguing. Everything else was either flawed or just not that special to me. However, I was attracted to see a movie that DeNiro directed. Overall, it has it's problems but it can still be enjoyed by the casual viewer's eye.",

A side benefit for auto geeks is the wonderful display of 1960s cars, especially the Caddies. It's too bad that Lillo Brancato fell into drugs and crime himself, including incarceration. Supposedly, he is now clean and acting again. He's quite good.",

Some of the lines in this movie are all time great just a few examples would be \"the working mans the tough guy, your fathers the tough guy!\" \"People dont love him, they fear him\" this line is especially great because in a later scene you see sunny angry at C but he wasn't afraid of sunny he loved him, and probably one of the only people who did. Some more good ones were \"i did a good thing for a bad man\" the whole mickey mantle and car scene were also extremely memorable.2. the characters in this movie are so freaking good sunny is the top g of the block everyone feared him, although he actually cared abt his men and especially C, thats why he always wants C to stay away from trouble and his friends because he knew what was coming before C did. He also is portrayed very well and whenever he is on screen you know that he has the power to take whoevers standing infront of him out but he is actually quite kind for a mob boss but when someone messes with him or his crew he'll take care of business. His lessons are also just so fantastic. \"To be love or fear\" \"the unlock the car door\" \"the 20 dollars\" so much good stuff!3. Lorenzo is a hard working man that is committed to making an honest living being a hard working family man. He knows the outcome that happens if you get involved with the gangsters so he tries as hard as he can to keep C away because he loves him. He also works so hard so C can be better than he is when he gets older and this scene is shown perfectly when they are fighting in there house.4. C or calogero is another fantastic aspect of the movie. It feels like such a real character. He didn't know a thing except he was earning money easily and the opposite way of his father. At age 9 he is being introduced into the world of the mafia without his fathers consent. Then an 8 year jump occurs and during this time you see him go through life understanding more now but also still has so much to learn. He goes through relationships and how to manage them but also has friends that are big time trouble and he knows it but there his friends that have been with him for years so he has to work through that. The ending comes to a great close when C finally sees what happens when you get involved with the mob life.5. I already talked about the fantastic lines in this movie but its really the whole thing is well written and all the lines have meaning and come back later in the film. The dialogue is interesting and real.6. The realism of this movie is all thanks to di nero being a fantastic director that creates an authentic film that also balances out the relationship between c, sunny and lorenzo so good.7. A little something small was also pescis camo was super fun to see.Negatives:1. The song choices played sometimes can be a little to loud and can be distracting from the dialogue.2. the movie can be a little slow some time especially when C was a child. There is no real plot so things kinda just play out through life which is why some scenes are alot better than others3. I was kinda sad how sometimes C would talk to his dad when his dad only wanted his best. Also i wish there was a little more dialogue between him and his dad at the end of the movie really solidifying Cs apology to his dad.4. I thought taral hicks was also not never good in this movie and made me cringe quite a bit.Overall:This movie is a very good mob movie but also is a real heartfelt movie that is a slow telling story with all time great lines.Writting/plot~ 9.5/10\nActing 9.5/10\nDesign/cinematography 9/10\nMusic 7.5/10\nDirecting 10/10\nCharacters 9.5/10.55/6092%",

I've read after seeing the play on off-Broadway in 1990, DeNiro asked Chazz Palminteri for the film rights, which he agreed to in exchange for the starring role in the film. Due to both the critically and commercially successful run of the play and film respectively, Palminteri revived the play and took it on tour in 2007 where I was able to meet him and see his play in Tucson, AZ. I put A Bronx Tale right up there with Casino and Goodfellas. It reflects the mafia in a way no previous films of its time had. There's lots of humor and life lessons alike. Chazz told me and in many other interviews it's loosely based on a variety of situations he was exposed to as a child growing up in the Bronx. It has a very humorous side, but can also be serious in it's story. This movie is quite a rewarding watch! Reviewed by AN/NR 11-14-11",

The acting is offensively bad, and the casting all wrong. the similarities which it bears to goodfellas would lead us to believe that something good might come out of this hugely incomparable film. For some reason Robert De Niro, who i might add i am quickly loosing faith with, has removed himself from his more typical gangster role and is now the loving caring parent of out central protagonist \"C.\" Although a fairly poor performance was to follow from De Niro he did manage to provoke some emotion from me even if it was in the form of mild disgust. Which is more than can be said for the rest of this films actors, who should now be working a 9-5 in Mcdonalds, and should never have the opportunity to \"grace\" our screens again with their ridiculously poor acting skills.The plot is shabby and looks as if it was simply coming off the top of De Niros seemingly shameless head. We follow our character \"C\" which whom we develop absolutely no sympathy for throughout, as he becomes known with the local gangsters, which is a term i feel slightly shameful using as this uncouth \"gang\" of actors amounts to nothing more than a rather ugly gathering of very unlikeable characters. The thought behind this film is minuscule. I am aware that we are supposed to feel compassion for our characters \"sonny\" and \"C\" who stride to be up each others arse for the entire duration of the film. I feel i may have offended some readers who believe this film to be anything more than a joke. I shall end my comments here as i no longer have the urge to think about this film again.DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. 121 MINUTES CAN BE SPENT MORE WISELYthanksSenor Martez",

DeNiro is not a TAXI DRIVER but a bus driver who's trying to keep his son away from the Italian mafia .

From the beginning scene the movie was very humble and very nice to watch. I could sleep but I didn't. This is a very important movie, I haven't watched a movie like this that humbly binds the watcher to the film without creating any needless feelings like anger, hate to the characters,etc. Unfortunately this movie has not been so much advertised I guess, but it is a really \"successful\"(watch out: successful, not good or cool) movie portraying the Bronx life of the sixties from a boy's view, and excellently portraying the lives of the working for meager money, noble and yet very strong-charactered man and the mob boss. After the movie we are may realize that the mob bosses are actually very good hearted people too, only they have to be approached in their style. But again, \u00fd have to say that we experience everything in the movie without feeling it, but seeing it, you know.

            "content": "I only knew about the Bronx Tale  by going to this website and reading about it. I've really wanted to see the film after. There were some good reviews, and some not-so good reviews, but I wanted to see for myself. I personally found this to be a very good movie. The cast is Francis Capra, (Who plays Calogero when he is nine), Chazz Palmeterri;I'm sorry if I spelled it wrong but this is a long name!; who plays Sonny, the mob boss, the guy that \"owns\" the  town, Lillo Brancato, who plays the seventeen year old Calogero Annelo,Taral Hicks, who plays Calogero's colored love interest, the nice, but bad-acting Jane Williams, and Robert De Niro, who plays Calogero's father, who is a bus driver. And Katherine,(I forgot the actresses' name) who plays the mother.This is a film all about a boy named Calogero Anello, who is caught between two worlds. Sonny, the guy he looks up to, and his father, the guy he dosen't look up to that much. You could tell he was kind of ashamed of his father. THE FATHER: \"My mother and father came to this country with nuthin'\" CALOGERO: \"And they died with nuthin'! We ain't gotta a cah, man. Don't blame me cus your a bus drivah. The workin' guy is the suckah.\" He respects Sonny, a guy who works in the mafia. Sonny is very insecure, to me. He dosen't trust anyone. But he is very fond of Calogero. \"Fu** those guys. They're not your friend. I'm your friend,\" Sonny says.Calogero cuts school sometimes to smoke with his friends and holler at hott italian girls. (Well not him, his friends.) When they see a car filled with blacks pass by, his friends get mad. Especially one in particular called \"Slick\" (\"What the fu**! What th fu**! What the fu** ah these motherfu**ing nigg** doin' in our neighboorhood!) \"Why don't you leave them alone?\" Calogero says. \"They ain't botherin' nobody.\" \"The fu**ing bothering me!\" \"They ain't botherin' me!\" In the black neighboorhood, it's basically the same, one of the black kids see Calogero, throw and objectile at him, and call him a \"white motherfuc****\" In the midst of all this chaos, he meets a black chick on his bus who you can tell he's in love by the way he stares at her all blankly and hazy at her. He is in love with her. His friends don't know about it,thank god, he only tells Sonny. Who seems the only other tolerant person in the movie. He assures him that when Calogero and the \"colored broad\" are together, under the covers, that's all that will matter.\"  There is no sex between them or anything, but they do kiss twice, with tongue.\nI've read the other comments and news reviews and they've stated that lillo brancato(the boy who plays the grown up \"C\") did a horrible performance. Not true! He did great, in fact, everybody did. Except Taral Hicks, the girl who plays Jane. She's a horrible actress, and she's no Tyra Banks either. Not too say she's ugly, she's a little bit of a looker, but she's no Halle Berry.About her acting;everything thing she says does sounds soooooo phony and planned. In one scene when a bunch of guys die in a fire (I'm not telling you who and why! That would be a spoiler!) She runs all fake to the fire, pretending to be all concerned. Even when Calogero, (Lillo, who did good job,  at least in my opinion.)offers to walk her home, she walks all fake and annoying and whatnot. 8/10, good acting, good script, good story,but I agree with the guy that said the interacial love scene sounds a little unrealistic.I didn't grow up in the sixties, but still. Maybe I would have been more convinced if Taral Hicks, had acted better I think they should of cast someone else. Hicks should stick to Motown and singing.",

The first time director Robert Dinero wanted to tell a story about a kid torn apart in life not knowing which way to go or where he is being pushed. A softer side of a gangster flick showing real emotions of these gangsters, it makes them look more real and true to life because gangsters have feelings too.

            "content": "I'll start by saying that this is one of the best films of the 90's and is criminally overlooked. And then I'll attempt to justify that statement, but the film is the only real justification. Robert De Niro's directorial debut is a deeply absorbing film about a kid growing up in Little Italy, New York, and the effect that the neighbourhood, in particular a mafia boss has on him. De Niro plays Lorenzo Anello, the honest, hard working father of Calogero, played by two actors: Francis Capra at age 9, and Lillo Brancato at age 17. Calogero, or \"C\" as he is later nicknamed, is interested by the man who runs the bar a couple of doors down, Sonny, played by Chazz Palminteri(who also wrote the play it was adapted from, and the screen play. It is also based on his upbringing). This interest grows hugely early on in the film when C witnesses Sonny shooting a man in the street, it seems like over a parking space. Later that day C is asked by the police to identify the shooter, but C doesn't rat him out. And what this does is make Sonny, the Mafia Boss, interested in C. As the film plays out, C gets more and more attached to Sonny, who sets him as good an example as you can expect from such a man, and this attachment worries Lorenzo. It worries him because he wants C to be \"a real man\" and work an honest job, but realises he is slipping towards crime. This is not a crime film, but I think it suffers because thats what people expect it to be. This is a film about how the neighbourhood that a boy who grows up in affects his coming of age. And it is the whole neighbourhood, not just Sonny. He is the biggest influence, but other things that affect C in a big way are the racical hatred that his friends show towards black people, and the way his Dad tries to get him to be, as a result of what he knows goes on around there. The setting is very similar to the start of Goodfellas, but unlike that film, this one shows the neighbourhood in a lot more detail, and in a way the 'hood is the main factor in the film. Whereas Goodfellas is concerned with 3 guys' journey through crime, Bronx Tale is concerned with the effect of the neighbourhood, particularly Sonny, on a person's evolution. The film is made wonderfully, with a good script and great acting, but I think the real kudos should go to De Niro's direction, because he really brings the setting and the mood alive, through well planned sets and locations, and a fantastic soundtrack. I have heard critics say this is not at all original, and when you think that you will have seen similar things in Goodfellas, I suppose it isn't, except in one way. And that is what I have already mentioned. The Godfather was about family. Goodfellas was about low end Mob crime.Mean Streets was about small time hoods. This is about the environment around you and how that will make you \"understand\", something that C is continually told he will when he is older, and eventually does. The fact that it has similarities with many other films is by the by because it couples this with a refreshing philosphical take on many diffrent things. It deserves to be treated as a masterpiece, and thats how I think of it. 5/5 and a huge round of applause.",

            "content": "This is an interesting movie because it tackles two topics in one shot: the lure of the glamorous life of crime and the state of racism in the 1960s.\"A Bronx Tale\" shows Calogero Anello, a young Italian living in the Bronx, faced with both of these issues. His childhood idol is a violent crime boss (Palminteri), while his friends, along with nearly everybody in his neighborhood, are racist. Meanwhile, he takes a liking to a black girl, and his honest father (De Niro) tries to keep him away from the crime syndicate and instill working class values in him. What choices will Calogero make and how will they affect his future? De Niro and Palminteri both give outstanding performances. The plot is not riveting, but is still interesting enough to keep the viewer involved. Rather than plot devices or complicated story lines, the film keeps us engrossed with character interactions and emotions. Calogero strikes me as being a little stupid, although not as stupid as his friends. I suppose this is necessary, however. A really intelligent person (like De Niro's character) would find ways to avoid becoming embroiled in all the neighborhood goings-on.It is frightening to think that racism was so rampant so few years ago, and saddening to think it still exists. \"A Bronx Tale\" does a fine job of illustrating that no good comes from hate.",

The drama is about trust, friendship and racism, always entertaining and beautiful, still not perfect.

Starting at an early age, he witnesses mobsters & gangster style activities right from his front door. After a while, he becomes a friend of the neighborhood \"boss\" Sonny, much to his father's dismay. Then over the years as he gets older, in the late 60's, the Italian Calagero, just so happens to meet a \"Colored\" girl named Jane. The thing is though, racial tensions were heating up in Calagero's part of the Bronx at the same time, putting Calagero in a tight situation. As for the moral of the story, the advice that Sonny and Calagero's father(played by Robert DeNiro) gave to Calagero about staying away from bad company(which in this case were Calagero's friends of his own age group) proved to be useful and fruitful. This movie succeeds on at least two levels. First of all, it shows how racial tension did NOT solve anything, and secondly, it shows a prime example of how following a careless group of friends could lead to one's own demise. I was also impressed by how I didn't notice any dull moment in the movie at all.

Unlock the door for her and let her get in. Then go around the back of the car and look through the rear window. If she doesn't reach over and unlock the door for you, then dump her quick, because she is selfish. I think about this movie every time I give someone a ride. While I don't think the test is 100% accurate, in my experiences with it, it's not wrong much.

I would recommend it to fans of both De Niro and gangster flicks alike thou don't go in expecting a Goodfellas, Godfather type movie because that it is not. Its quite different then the majority of films in this genre. It follows 'C' from being a 9 year old kid from the Bronx witnessing a murder committed by the towns main man 'Sonny' who then takes 'C' under his wing when he doesn't snitch. Thou 'C'dad (De Niro) doesn't like his son hanging around with him one bit. Thou despite his best efforts several years pass 'c' is now in his late teens and closer to Sonny then ever. So you think this is going to be a rivelry story between C's real father and Sonny his father figure but it only touches on that sub plot a couple more times and its not really made into a big deal. Then it becomes a sort of 'Romeo and Juliet' type romance when 'C' falls for a girl from the African-American side of town which then brings on a tale of racism and conflict.In short this is a very good film, the acting is well done, the 60's era its set in is very realistic and features some great music. Thou it chops and changes a few times the plot line in general is enjoyable. But like I say don't go into this thinking just because De Nero directs and features in the film its going to be a masterpiece. In fact I think his performance is a little disappointing for his great standard, it shows that his main focus was the directing (which is very well done)as opposed to acting. I felt that his scenes didn't have much heart to them despite the importance of the father to son scenes. Its actually the man who plays Sonny that steals the show for me I was captivated every time he came on screen, he managed to be humorous (the 'dice throwing' scene is hilarious), caring yet at the same time very unpredictable.I think if your a fan of the Gangster type movie in general you will like this movie, the romantic side of it may or may not be to your liking. Its enjoyable and worth a watch so I do recommend you give it a go at least.Oh and if you're just watching it for Joe Pesci don't bother hes in it for about 2 minutes which was a bit disappointing he wasn't in it for longer.Hope you enjoy it!",

Additionally this movie illustrated how hard teenage romance is and how much effort that has to be put into it to make it work. One thing I think this movie could have worked was making the ending better. Another thing this movie did well was allowing its audience to be able to empathize with several of the characters and i think that a good thing because while watching the movie you tend to relate to the difficulties and experience of others.",

Most movies can't even come close to explaining one of them, but \"A Bronx Tale\" shows all three of these themes in a wonderful style.Also I should mention the fabulous directing (and acting) from Mr. DeNiro- who made his directorial debut and the genius script written by Chazz Palminteri.I highly recommend this film, a little violent here and there but overall a stunning and beautifal story about life and love in The Bronx.",

I've been to NYC many times but only went to the Bronx once, so I have a sense of the atmosphere, however vague, and I think this movie captures it perfectly. Secondly, and for me more importantly, I never fail to smile when I think about the relationship that developed between Calogero, age 17, and Jane, a black girl in his class. This movie is a reminder that two people should be able to get to know each other, as friends or boyfriends/girlfriends, without having to worry about their race and whether it matches the other person's. It's just two people getting together. If things get serious, they'll deal with it when the time comes, but if society can't accept it, they should turn a blind eye because the relationship never had anything to do with them in the first place.",

Not that you can really compare the two, but De Niro, a long-time masterful actor has put together a real winner here.  The story is humorous, yet sincere, dramatic, yet endearing.This is not just a gangster mafia flick, but a story about a boy who grows up in Little Italy and idolizes both his father (De Niro) and the local Mafia head (Palminteri) who have different views on life.  The story, converted from a play written by Palminteri is incredibly well written with dialogue that is humorous and serious simultaneously and contains a lot of truth.  If you don't believe me, just try Sonny's test.",

Why should man be honest when strong power and violence can solve anything? Maybe father has expressed his hope that the son found answers to these questions, but I think it's not so clear.

I took two stars because of the unnecessary explicit sexual references. The building of the characters throughout the movie is fairly good.

A brilliant piece of storytelling that touches upon the issues prevalent at the time, and a plot that reveals itself only until the last minute.What I particularly liked about the film was the depth of the characters, a trait that is often overseen in today's Hollywood movies. The characters themselves are the most powerful symbols in the movie. The main character, \"c\", is influenced by two distinct male roll models. The hard working, dutiful father (deniro) who doesn't have much, but worked hard and earned everything that is his. The other male role model, sonny (Palminteri), is the symbol of crime and extortion, the guy that runs the neighborhood. Money floats like liquor, and everything seems all too easy. But sonny has a soft spot for \"c\", and his preachings to the young and wise contrast with the stiff, rugged lectures of his father. The discord evident between the influences to young \"c\" leads to a captivating, wonderful story of the childhood and education, both in school and on the streets, of a young child in the Bronx.",

            "content": "I liked this movie in the fact that you saw a different side of De Niro. He played a man who would give anything for his family and worked hard in a low paying job instead of being a rich mobster. During the movie De Niro's character proved more than once that he didn't need the mob's dirty money to succeed. He once took back $600 that the street boss Sonny gave to his son. Another time he was offered $150 a week to deliver numbers to people and turned it down. and though his son and his wife give him crap about not taking his chances with the mob, he keeps on keepin on.A couple things bothered me about the movie though. The major one being that you didn't know who to side with in the movie. Here you have the good-guy Lorenzo (De Niro's character) who is working hard to keep his son off the street, and then you have the semi-villain Sonny (Chazz Palminteri) who is teaching Calogero or \"C\", the main character, how to live on the streets but stay out of trouble. So Sonny isn't really teaching C to do bad things and when he does, Sonny slaps him around a bit. But they try to make Sonny out to be a good guy/bad guy and it doesn't really fly to well. Another thing that bothered me was the mother disappeared in the middle of the movie with no explanation.Some other thing I thought were cool in this movie was the choice of music, which was not just your classic mob stuff (Sinatra, etc.) but they used soul and R & B, which was cool. Another thing I liked was the Inter-racial relationship between Jane and C. You don't see stuff like that in many movies, especially mob movies set in the late 1960'sAll in all, this movie was fun and interesting to watch. I thought it was better to watch it on TV too because they say the F-word about ever 2 seconds. So anytime your bored or feel like an uplifting mob-type movie, rent this and see the other side to mob movies.",

Forget other ignorant comments by users who were disappointed that it wasn't a gangster movie or who don't think the interracial relationship was realistic (yet they admit they weren't even alive during the 60's!).
