            "content": "Wow, what a wonderful movie this turned out to be!I didn't check this movie out until the fall of 2004 after reading a number of positive reviews, enough to pique my curiosity. I was glad I did. In fact, I was so impressed with this film that a week later I went out and bought the book, which is even better. First of all, the film is a tremendous visual treat. There are some great interior scenes of the Darlington mansion, and great colors inside and in the surrounding outside scenery. This is simply a beautiful film. Second, the acting of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson was spectacular. They were riveting. The way they deliver dialog and the expressions of their faces.....magnificent acting. Thompson's sad look in the back of the bus near the end of the movie is the saddest, most haunting look on a person's face I have ever seen in 50 years of movie watching. Hopkins, one of the best actors of this generation, provides a tremendous character study of a man who has been taught that to be the best in his profession, he must suppress all emotion. In doing so, he never learns to think for himself and he misses out on what could have been the love of his life. In that regards, this is a very frustrating story.However, this isn't just a tragic romantic story. Hopkins' character is wonderful example, too, of unselfish devotion and dignified servitude in the face of any kind of circumstance. This is an extremely beautiful, intelligent and sensitive film. If when people tell you, \"They don't make 'em like they used to,\" show them this film.",

            "content": "Excellent film that was overlooked in 1993 due to the dominance of \"Schindler's List\", \"The Remains of the Day\" is an exquisite film which examines the relationship between two servants in England (Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, both Oscar-nominated).  They both definitely have feelings for each other, but both seem to be bound by duty, honor, and society.  Hopkins is not the type of person who shares his inner-most feelings with anyone and Thompson wants to share her hidden love for Hopkins, but is frightened for various reasons.  The fact that the film is told during flashbacks which took place just before the involvement of England in World War II just makes everything that much more interesting and heart-wrenching.  During the present-day of the movie it appears that Hopkins and Thompson will finally proclaim their love for one another, but in the end that is not even a real certainty.  Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's adaptation of the novel is exceptional and James Ivory's direction has rarely been better or more focused.  With all this said, it is Hopkins and Thompson that dominate the action and make \"The Remains of the Day\" one of the best films of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Ishiguro's story of duty finds career butler Mr Stevens preparing to meet Miss Kenton, once the head maid in his household.  They have not seen each other for 15 years and once had an unspoken love.  As he journeys down to meet her he remembers a lifetime spent in quiet, honourable service.I don't like period pieces.  Merchant-Ivory stuff usually feels very false and stifled to me.  Here I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away from start to finish.  To say the story is about a romance isn't the whole picture, to say it's about British-German politics pre-WW2 is not the full story.  In fact the film is about it all - but the focus is Mr Stevens.  He serves dinner while his father dies in an upstairs room, he puts his own opinions so far back that he doesn't have any, he is so focused on the proper way to serve that he never finds his own life.  To describe in like this makes it sound very dull, and to some people it may be, but trust me - the story is beautifully observed and has so much going on in the background that it'll keep you interested.  The main reason it works is a faultless central performance by Hopkins.Hopkins drives the whole film.  His face and his speech reveal more about his inner feelings than anything else.  It can be frustrating to see him always put on a brave face and bury his emotions, but once you get his character (a man of quiet honour, dignity and respect - any wonder he seems otherworldly by modern standards) it's fine.  He is fantastic - I cannot say it enough.  His lot in life is moving, but what is incredibly moving is that he seems content to let his life slide by.  The scene where Thompson's Miss Kenton confronts him about the book he is quietly reading is beautiful, truly beautiful - revealing their closeness and the depth of Stevens' heart. Thompson is also excellent in her role but doesn't have as much screen time as Hopkins.  Fox, Reeves and Chaplin are all excellent in their roles.If the film has a weakness it is that it doesn't judge the rich - even the Nazi sympathisers.  It almost seems to revere the elite - I know they are not the focus but Merchant-Ivory always seems to be obsessed with how the other half live (or maybe they are part of the other half!).  The ending is also a little disappointing because it's quite low-key, but it's very, very touching.Overall this is excellent - I didn't think it would be that good, but it totally blew me away.  Sit down and let this story unfold before you, let the characters develop and ensnare you.  I guarantee you will be deeply moved by Hopkins.  The rather crude message of `seize the day' is beautifully told in a rich tapestry of one man's life.",

            "content": "Impeccably cast and produced in typical Merchant-Ivory manner, this understated drama features superb performances by two of the finest actors in modern cinema, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Both an acid indictment of the British class system and an unflinching portrayal of a man who in the end cannot transcend his largely self-imposed limitations, the film is both fascinating and agonizing to watch and its cumulative emotional impact will stay with you long after it's over. There is an exquisite moment near the finale when Thompson's character bares only slightly a hint of the feelings she has for Hopkins, an allusion to what might have been between them. And Hopkins, in his consummate skill, maintains in both facial and vocal expressions the most non-committal of replies; his face a mask of bland affability but his eyes dark with the knowledge that he is a dead man who has wasted his life. With no outward show of emotion, the scene is devastating.THE REMAINS OF THE DAY may not be a happy film, but it is a memorable and powerful one.",

            "review_title": "Anthony Hopkins Brings Sheer Genius to the Role of Mr. Stevens",
            "content": "Anthony Hopkin's interpretation of the single-minded English butler, Mr. Stevens, has to be one of the most fully realized roles ever to appear on film. His interaction with the lovely and intelligent housekeeper, Miss Kenton, is so realistic that it is painful to watch. Despite his growing love and admiration for her, he keeps his feelings firmly under control, determined that they will not destabilize his carefully crafted existence. Always expecting Stevens to make the first move, Miss Kenton tries everything in her power to get under his skin or to make him jealous, but she only succeeds in torturing them both all the more. The emotional turning point of the movie takes place in Mr. Steven's private room, where he has fallen asleep in his chair while reading a novel. Enter Miss Kenton in a playful mood carrying another bunch of flowers to brighten up his quarters. Curious about his reading material, she tries to get the book away from him because he refuses to tell her what it is. She moves in close, as close as they ever will be, and as she struggles for the volume, Stevens longingly admires her lovely countenance, her soft hair, and no doubt gets a good strong whiff of her sweet fragrance, wishing he could gently kiss her and take her in his arms, but that would lead to ... what? Finally, he allows her to pull the book from his grasp and Miss Kenton finds that it is far from what she had expected, being just some sentimental old love story. This is, of course, a poignant revelation. She looks up at him, her love as obvious as their proximity, and they gaze into one another's eyes for a few brief seconds. Then Stevens simply tells her to please respect his privacy and to leave him alone. Callously rebuffed, she does just that, for the rest of his earthly days. It is the biggest mistake that Mr. Stevens has ever made, and for a very competent and exacting man, it is all too apparent that he must have made many such extremely serious errors. On her next evening off, he watches helplessly from the window as Miss Kenton rides her bicycle into town, knowing that on that very day, he has somehow all but lost her for good. The pain and anxiety on his face are palpable, if brilliantly underplayed. Stevens gets one final chance to forestall the inevitable, her impending marriage to Tom Bent, but as per usual, does nothing to stop it because duty calls. Nearing the conclusion of the movie, when they are reunited after a generation has passed, Stevens is crestfallen to learn that Miss Kenton has changed her mind at the last minute and, following her divorce, will not be returning with him to resume her duties as housekeeper at Darlington Hall. Instead, she has chosen to remain \"in the west country\" in order to help bring up her granddaughter. Of course, poor sad Stevens couldn't even consider seeking employment in that locale in order to eke out a few years of bliss with Sara in what remains of his sad, lonely life. When they part company for the last time, he holds onto her hand for as long as he can, then as she tearfully rides away in the bus, he lifts his hat to the only woman he has ever loved and who has ever loved him. As if on autopilot, Stevens climbs back into the Daimler and turns over the engine. The hollow, utterly defeated look on his face belies the fact that the only thing left for him now is to face his inevitable death in a few short years. The camera does a closeup on the car's headlight and he starts back for his comfortable old rut of a life. Stevens was the consummate professional whereas his rival, Bent, placed strict limits on what he would tolerate from his employer, one of Lord Darlingon's aristocratic and bigoted colleagues. As such, he simply resigned from \"service\" in order to live life on his own terms. He doesn't squander his second chance to marry Miss Kenton and easily takes her away from Stevens, who obstinately and pridefully clings to his all-consuming job as far more important than affairs of the heart. Why? Perhaps because he is very skilled at the former and extremely inept at the latter. Instead of experiencing all the tenderness that the admiring Miss Kenton wanted to give him, he chose instead the importance of his position at Darlington Hall, a world stage where matters of serious consequence were considered in the midst of vast and lush grounds set in the beautiful English countryside. At the conclusion of the movie, we follow a trapped pigeon that is released from the confines of the mansion. It flies heavenward, and as the moving score builds to crescendo, we are treated to a bird's eye view of the magnificent estate for which Stevens has given up everything to be a part. What exactly does the pigeon represent? We can only guess, but one thing is certain. \"The Remains of the Day\" is a beautiful and poignant movie, wonderfully acted by the two principals and effectively supported by the rest of the cast. Further, the writing, cinematography, score, and directing are nearly flawless. This has to be one of the best movies of the last several decades.",

            "review_title": "The best story of unrequited love in cinema history.",
            "content": "This is, in my opinion, the finest film in the Merchant Ivory canon.  And to hail it as such is to grossly undersell it.  It is not only that but also the best story of unrequited love in cinema history, and a masterpiece of understated emotion.  It also boasts some of the finest performances ever put on film, most notably from the peerless Anthony Hopkins.Then again, understatement is the key to this film.  Writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Director James Ivory adapt Kazuo Ishiguro's poignant novel with such delicacy that it gets under ones skin in a deeply profound way difficult to express in a few words.The plot opens in the 1950's as meticulous and emotionally repressed butler Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) reviews a lifetime of service in Darlington Hall. The story flashes back to the 1930's where Stevens formed a close friendship with housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson).  This relationship grew slowly over several years and ultimately the pair developed romantic feelings for one another, although neither admitted it.  Whilst all this was happening, Steven's employer Lord Darlington (Edward Fox) gradually became a misguided Nazi sympathiser in pre-war Europe.  Unfortunately, loyalty to his master caused Stevens to reject the delicate advances of Miss Kenton.  History took its inevitable course, and Darlington's involvement in appeasement contributed to the outbreak of World War II.  Now Stevens realises he made a mistake and wants to make amends.To describe Anthony Hopkins as brilliant is completely redundant.  His turn here goes way beyond mere acting, and it was criminal he was denied the Oscar at the 1994 Academy awards.  Stevens absurdly repressed personality gently takes the audience from laughter to tears in the most emotionally devastating finale I have ever seen.  Hopkin's mesmerising performance is matched by a career-best turn from Emma Thompson.  The supporting cast is uniformly superb, including a pre-Four Weddings Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeve in one of his last roles before the accident that paralysed him.Needless to say, the cinematography, music, editing and art direction are immaculate.  The understated beauty of the English countryside that was so important to the book translates brilliantly to film here.\nThis is a lovely, melancholic film, which effortlessly embraces complex themes such as misguided loyalty, dignity, pride, wasted lives, and unrequited love.  It would be all too much to bear if it weren't for the film's genuine good-humoured understanding of English culture (all the more remarkable for having been initially penned by a Japanese author).  In fact, humour is an important element in the film.  There are many laugh-out-loud moments, which make the tragic part of the story all the more real and poignant.  All in all, The Remains of the Day is a milestone film \u0096 an unforgettable tragedy of a man who pays the terrible price of denying his own feelings.",

The film does a wonderful parallel examination of the man's life set against the tumult of the 1930s that effectively did away with the British Empire and made him and others like him, as people curiously obsolete.An extremely rare example of sanity when dealing with the subject of War. Most films as we know too well, concentrate on the futility and bottom line cost in humanity, which is to be expected since generally speaking, an artist will always present this point of view. However in most cases, it's an incomplete and wildly immature handling of the topic. This film addresses if you can believe it, the folly of avoiding War thru appeasement, and hammers home what might have been avoided if the British had called Hitler to the carpet early on, instead of playing chess with him. This is the backdrop; the main story is that of the butler, Stevens, an ostensibly simple character played with unimaginable complexity, by Hopkins. The fascinating examination of one man's sense of duty, a devotion that transcends all other obligations and aspirations in his life has never been so poignantly or expertly presented to an audience. Everything about the film, the supporting cast in particular is a rousing triumph. I cannot overly recommend this.",

            "content": "I saw \"The Remains of the Day\" for the first time in two years. I loved it then, I love it even better now. If you want an impeccably acted, beautifully filmed and an altogether poignant study on unrequited love, watch \"The Remains of the Day\". It is not only poignant, but surprisingly intelligent and somewhat thought provoking. Not to mention it is so beautiful to watch.Visually, \"The Remains of the Day\" is absolutely splendid. The insides of the Darlington mansion were beautifully furnished, the period settings were wonderful and the outside scenery was gorgeous. All captured seamlessly by the fluid cinematography. Then the music is stunning, beautiful mostly, but haunting in others. Then there is the quality of the script, part of the reason why the film is so intelligent, so well interwoven and really makes you think.The story is a lovely, if melancholic one. One of the strong points of this film is the depiction of unrequited love, so effectively done. There are also some interesting and complex themes introduced such as dignity, pride and loyalty(shown here as misguided). People may be put off by this film, it is very nuanced and not exactly fast paced, but is riveting thanks to the impeccable performances, sensitive direction and the perfect balance of genuine good humour and tragedy, shown in a really poignant way in this film.The direction was sensitive and as one review I read(not on IMDb) said alive to every nuance, that I agree with wholeheartedly. What made this already superb film was the acting. James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Tim Piggott-Smith and Peter Vaughan all turn in solid supporting performances, but the lead performances were superb, and that's putting it mildly. Anthony Hopkins is simply mesmerising as Stevens, the emotionally repressed butler with an unwavering sense of duty who embarks on an intense relationship with the housekeeper Miss Kenton. I loved him in \"The Elephant Man\" and \"Shadowlands\"(both of them fantastic films) but his performance here was so good it is by far away in the top 5 of his best performances. As Miss Kenton, Emma Thompson is riveting and really attractive, her delivery is so convincing as are her facial expressions she was so compelling to watch. The look on her face at the bus stop is not only sad, it is truly haunting and it never fails to make me tear up. it stays with you forever, it really shows what a wonderful actress Thompson is.Overall, a wondrous film, and a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Add flawless performances from the all-star cast and the result is almost too perfect. But there is just enough humility to this sad tale of unrequited love to make it completely believable.Anthony Hopkins excels as the impenetrable Mr. Stevens, Butler of a lordly country house in the final days of the British Empire, and Emma Thompson is superb as his foil, Housekeeper Miss Kenton.  Both give wonderfully deep, sensitive portrayals of two complex lonely people who don't realize, until it's too late, that they belong together.  Swirling around them is fascinating drama of life upstairs and downstairs and there are as many surprises and sub-plots to the story (based on a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro) as there are secret passages, nooks, and crannies in \"Darlington House.\" \nAn all-round first-rate cinematic experience, \"Remains of the Day\" is one of those pictures that lingers in the mind long after the credits pass.

            "review_title": "Poignant portrait of a butler's life...dedication, restraint, and regret",
            "content": "This is an incredibly moving and tragic film that paints a vivid portrait of the restrained life of a butler at an English manor, and brings humanity to those in service. It examines the English class system and the relationship between master and servant, but primarily depicts a life of regret. The haunting musical score provides compelling accompaniment to this butler's unfolding tragic personal life story. The manor used to depict Darlington Hall is magnificent, the palatial rooms and luxurious furnishings spectacular, the English countryside scenery lovely.Mr. Stevens has devoted his entire life to being the butler at Darlington Hall, currently owned by a millionaire American Senator named Lewis, who had earlier visited the manor. The film flashes back to the butler's years of loyal service and unselfish dedication to his previous employer, Lord Darlington. During that time he is shown to devote himself completely to the efficient running of this enormous household and to totally suppress his own emotions. The butler's restrained veneer is put to the test by the arrival of a new housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who is herself energetic and efficient but challenges him with her wit. The pair develop unexpressed but very obvious feelings for each other. Meanwhile, the gullible Lord Darlington becomes naively involved as a Nazi sympathizer, instrumental in British attempts to appease Hitler back in the late 1930's.Anthony Hopkins is absolutely masterful in the role of the perfect butler, Mr. Stevens, his face a mirror of the words he cannot express. He superbly conveys this trusted servant's loyalty, dedicated efficiency, dignified service, restraint, and suppressed emotions. Emma Thompson is equally brilliant as the capable housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who does display her emotions without ever stating them directly. Other cast members include Hugh Grant as Lord Darlington's godson, and the wonderful late Christopher Reeve as Darlington Hall's present owner, Lewis. James Fox portrays the extremely misguided but never truly villainous Lord Darlington.The butler reveals himself to be unfailingly dedicated to his household, overseeing an elaborate dinner party as his own father is dying upstairs. Mr. Stevens never expresses his political or personal opinions, regardless of whether they are solicited. He diligently performs every single duty expected of him, even awkwardly attempting to fulfill Lord Darlington's request to enlighten his godson about the birds & the bees before his marriage. Despite his own unacknowledged misgivings, at His Lordship's insistence he dismisses two maids simply because they are Jewish. As Lord Darlington's Nazi collaboration unfolds, Mr. Stevens concentrates on performing his duties, endeavours not to admit even to himself awareness of these unsettling political matters, and remains unquestioningly loyal to his aristocratic employer.In this movie we have an undeclared romance between two mature people who never once express their feelings for each other, yet their love is blatantly apparent and absolutely compelling. The viewer gets a glimpse into the depth of unexpressed love in Mr. Stevens' heart when Miss Kenton discovers him reading a sentimental romance novel. He is painfully embarrassed at her discovery but again admits no emotion. The housekeeper's entire demeanor conveys how much she craves his love, threatening to wed another so that Mr. Stevens will finally reveal himself. When he does not, Miss Kenton marries a man she does not love. The butler's emotions are equally obvious on countless occasions, as when he gazes at the departing Miss Kenton from the window above. It is frustrating for the viewer, watching this honourable and dignified gentleman constantly put on a brave and proper outer facade while denying his own emotions, whether grief over his father or love for the housekeeper.Twenty years later Mr. Stevens is filled with regret over his wasted life, his misguided sense of duty toward Lord Darlington, a man of disgraced reputation and now dead. He tries to remedy the error of his emotional suppression but alas, it is too late. Miss Kenton is unhappily married but has a grown, now pregnant daughter and her own sense of duty. Even when she broaches the topic of evening (as in the twilight of their lives), the reserved butler still does not declare his feelings. Their final farewell as she tearfully takes her leave by bus is surely one of the most restrained but sad and haunting depictions ever of two people in love parting. This is a superbly subtle, beautiful, and sensitive portrait of unfulfilled love and regret.",

            "content": "I am disappointed to see reviewers refer to this movie as anti-war or a story of unrequited love or Lord Darlington as a Nazi or WWII as a nuclear holocaust. I think that perhaps these comments reflect both the lack of an adequate attention span and a lack of a proper knowledge and perspective of the times. \"The Remains of the Day\" requires both. I found it to be an interesting movie with many facets, each of which could be used as the sole theme of a movie. It is a movie that has great acting, is beautifully filmed in and around one of England's great mansions, and tells a fascinating and complex story as well.It is true that the movie is about, in part, what many in the audience would believe is a romance that never has a chance because of Mr. Stevens' devotion to and pride in the occupation he has chosen. It is important to recognize that it is the job of his choosing, not one that has been forced upon him. It is tempting to write the job off as no more than servant of the wealthy, but it is actually the equivalent of presidency of a small company. Stevens is in charge of seeing that the large staff serving Darlington gets all of the many jobs in the household done - to perfection - every day of the week. I doubt that the White House has standards that approach those of Lord Darlington. So, each viewer can decide for himself or herself whether there could have ever been a woman in Stevens' life to whom he could give husband-like devotion.Darlington is not a Nazi sympathizer. He is a man who exhibits the ideals of 20th century Britain: honor, fairness, and full devotion to what is right. He believes, most would say correctly, that the Treaty of Versailles was unduly harsh in its treatment of post-WWI Germany. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize, as many Americans do now, that unfairness in the past cannot be rectified by stupid policies in the present. So, by seeking what he considers fairness for Germany in the 1930's, when Hitler's evil and expansionist aims should have been clearly evident, he and others set the stage for a world-wide conflict that cost 60 million lives, of which the lives lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute less than one-half of one percent.One of my tests of a movie is how far into it I start looking at my watch. In this case I began looking at my watch not to see how much more I had to sit through: rather, I was hoping to assure myself that there was enough movie left to provide a satisfactory ending. There was: however, I could have enjoyed much more of the talent and story I was seeing.",

This is the question that lies at the center of this intricate tale that parallels the goings-on at Darlington Hall within the servants and the diplomats who convene there where Mr. Stevens, the butler who Anthony Hopkins brings to deeper focus, works at -- work being a mild operative, since he has forgone any external manifestation of emotion and personality in lieu of becoming the \"perfect servant\".

In many ways, this could be a gentler, more touching variation of what Robert Altman would produce in 2001 as GOSFORD PARK with the crucial difference that where Altman's film focuses on a murder mystery and paintbrushes light strokes of colour over a large ensemble, Merchant-Ivory's REMAINS OF THE DAY is a romance tainted with darker, political overtones, the tie being solely the period where England was inching delicately towards war and the old society -- tradition -- was about to collapse to make way to the new way.Based on Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name, REMAINS OF THE DAY's plot is deceptively simple: it presents an older Stevens who is on his way to reconnect with an old friend and former co-worker, Mrs. Benn (Emma Thompson), nee Kenton, Darlington Hall's housekeeper. Through a series of vignettes we get to see how it was \"in the old days\", how Mrs. Kenton came to Darlington Hall, how she and Stevens initially did not get along due to the fact that Stevens' father was a sick man under Stevens' employ and was beginning to falter in his duties as the under-butler. However, as time went by, they would become quite a working team, and through subtle hints both suggest there may be more, however under-developed. We also get to see how Lord Darlington (James Fox), a somewhat pompous man, was progressively revealed to be a Nazi sympathizer and would make some ruining mistakes of his own -- a thing not lost on the American congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve) who one evening, as a toast to Lord Darlington, calls the European diplomats \"amateurs\" because they are operating on goodwill and not practicality.REMAINS OF THE DAY seems to be lacking in plot because in fact, it moves at its own pace much in the style of Merchant-Ivory movies. However, there is quite a bit happening here -- it's just not that evident at first glance. Because at its core, it's a story of people caught in a microcosm of the mundane as veiled, sinister events not to their full understanding are insinuating themselves at the very edges of the frame, there are times when it seems the story dwells too long on mediations of characters tics -- for example, the spat between Mrs. Kenton and Mr. Stevens about Mr. Stevens, Senior's forgetfulness over a Chinaman bobble head, itself a rung on the ladder of Mr. Stevens, Senior's eventual demotion. However, this is exactly the way two co-workers would go about in any other circumstance. It just so happens that theirs is the repetitive task of running a castle to the point that their presence is invisible, making the Hall seem as though it ran itself.However the movie is rife with subtext. Hugh Grant has a small part as the apparently clueless Cardinal who is in fact quite aware of his uncle's relation to the Germans and seems to represent an England of the future. He, and Reeve as the American businessman who will eventually succeed in owning Darlington Hall, are vastly different from the traditionalists that Mrs. Kenton, Mr. Stevens, and Lord Darlington are at heart -- even when Mrs. Kenton has a little extra that separates her from the two men, but even she is clamped down by her passivity towards an injustice committed to two German girls (whose final destiny remains unsolved, leading one to believe they may have met a horrible end) which mirrors her inability to truly take control of her life. Where the actual remains of the day would indicate that things would get better, the fact that Mrs. Kenton and Mr. Stevens are unable, maybe even unwilling (at this late point in their life) to truly confess what she had initiated at trying to unveil his inner life through a romance novel, represents the elegant devastation that overwhelms its presence which drowns the movie in regret. Regret for what never even had a chance in the first place even when it had enormous potential, and that makes it the more imploding.",

            "content": "I can only repeat what most previous commentators have said. This is a beautiful film in every way.Anthony Hopkins performance is awe-inspiring and difficult to describe. Stevens the butler never shows any emotion so his face is always suitably deadpan. The dialogue is spare. Then just how is it that we are able to follow the emotional undercurrents? Emma Thompson is also brilliant as the energetic housekeeper who does display and express her feelings without ever stating them directly. But all the actors are excellent, even in the most minor parts. Hugh Grant has a small part and plays it perfectly. Sadly his talent is too often misused and misapplied. James Fox was a revelation as prior to this I had only seen him in very light roles. Here he played an essentially decent man who is not too bright but has been born into wealth and influence. His sentiments and suggestibility lead him to misguided positions and tragedy.Among the many great scenes there is a hilarious laugh-out-loud sequence with Hopkins and Grant.I have seen \"A Room With a View\", another effort from the Merchant-Ivory-Jhabwala team. It is adapted from a lovely book but I disliked the film. I thought it failed to set the mood and put across the emotions. But in \"The Remains of the Day\" everything works. It is sad, actually heart-rending, but not gloomy. The period details are wonderfully executed and you are impressed by the order and efficiency in the running of the stately home. Everything in the film looks good- clean, bright and sharp. You are swept in at the beginning and stay rapt till the end. And the magic does not decrease with repeated viewing.

            "content": "\"The Remains of the Day\" is the kind of film where you first hope for something to happen then that nothing ever break the serene harmony inhabiting the story.Yet, to say that the film is plot-less would be as unfair as untrue: another successful product of the director and producer's duo: James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, the film offers another riveting slice of the British aristocratic life, this time during the inter-war, this time for a story even more enthralling because it is told from the servants' perspective, from the diary of William Stevens, the butler.As Stevens, Anthony Hopkins delivers such a solid performance, in all nuance and subtlety, that we can't doubt the man has been or could have been anything but a butler, obviously belonging to a tradition as old as the hills and whose William Stevens Sr. (Peter Vaughan) is another living remain. Stevens Jr. Has been impregnated his whole life by this impeccable perfectionism, total dedication to the master, and the dilution of his own ego into work; and to a certain extent, the butler's tasks, no matter how prestigious and dignified they seem in the beginning, turn our to be ingrate as the story progresses.This unfortunate hardship is crucial though as an empathy-builder, we see Stevens with eyes of sorrow for he's incapable to demonstrate any hint of freethinking or independent personality. And the power of Hopkins is to portray a man trapped in the one-note performance requested for his job, in a poignantly three-dimensional way. In fact, the main thrills of \"The Remains of the Day\" consist of spotting the little hints betraying Mr Stevens' capability for feelings. One clue: they mostly happen during the scenes involving directly or indirectly Emma Thompson, the second lead of the film.As Mrs Kenton, Emma Thompson, the smart and pretty housekeeper is educated and trained enough to see in Mr Stevens, a worthy of admiration colleague, and she's equal to him enough, in the household hierarchy, to allow herself some familiarities. Obviously fascinated by this mountain of coldness, she brings some flowers to his private room and then, something interesting happens. While he almost dismisses the flowers as 'distractions', he politely asks Mrs Kenton to display more respect toward his father, by not calling him by his Christian name.The scene can mislead by foreshadowing several clashes between the two servants, when they are only benign misunderstandings. But it does show that that there is a heart beating behind this impeccable costume and demeanor. And when this heart is about to collapse while the father is dying, Stevens continues to serve the Master's guest: no matter what happens, work must go on. This is Stevens' inner conflict, whose paradox is to create a gap between him and Mrs Kenton but in the same time, allows their mutual respect and tacit attraction, to grow patiently and discreetly with the passing of time.But we know that the romance is doomed from the very beginning, the story doesn't leave much for optimism. We know, when the movie opens that Stevens still work in the same manor, that his Master Lord Darlington died, and an American Congressman, played by Christopher Reeve, bought the house. Mrs Kenton left Darlington before the outbreak of the war and got married. The flow of the film conveys an insightful parallel between the romance and the relationship with the Master.James Fox plays Lord Darlington, not a Nazi sympathizer, but an ambiguous well-mannered gentleman who 'understands' the Germans. During a memorable toast, the American Congressman, and future house owner, would call all the assembled European politicians 'amateurs', an allegation that only shocks his audience, but doesn't fool us, not even Darlington's godson (Hugh Grant). The 'amateur' speech, with the same resonance than Churchill's 'dishonour and war' line, foresees the last days of an agonizing order that exploited the guilt of WWI victory, to roll the red carpets to the Nazis.And the tragic choices of Darlington would spill over Stevens' life. Incapable of adopting one defying attitude against his own master, Stevens condemned himself to a standard of life sadly prone to unhappiness and frustration. And it's precisely the kind of life that Mrs Kenton rejected by leaving the house. And her personal tragedy is that she left the only man she truly loved. \"The Remains of the Day\" chronicles two separate stories, challenging the solemn and unflappably professionalism of Mr Stevens, and interlocking each other until leading Stevens to a dead-end.And twenty years later, Stevens maintains the same level of mystery. People ask him where he stood for regarding his Master's opinion. Invoking the call of duty, he served his Master the best he could. He deplored some uninspired choices, the most significant being the revocation of two Jewish maids. But still, Stevens embraced his master's choices without being an accomplice. A few years later, the seal of infamy marks the name of Darlington, but not Stevens', yet there's no doubt his heart carries some regrets, and maybe, his unfulfilled relationship with Mrs Kenton is a way to make up for his own guilt.To have followed Darlington or not following Mrs Kenton? Looking back on his life, Stevens would understand the value of regrets, whether it's for done or undone choices, maybe by persuading a divorced Mrs Kenton to go back to Darlington? As a character study, the film is a wonderful examination of lives made of unmade choices and 'what if' questions, as a romance, it happens to be admirably poignant and brilliant, because feelings are so intimate and real that they can hardly be expressed, let alone from a man of such a few words like Mr Stevens.And this is why the ending plays as the perfect emotional pay-off for a film so full of frustrating inhibitions, a light of hope after an eternity spent in the Master's shadow.",

American Trent Lewis (Christopher Reeve) is the new owner and he keeps Mr. Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) as the butler. The movie flashes back to the 1936 when Darlington invites an international group including Lewis who was a Congressman at the time to discuss helping Germany. His godson Reginald Cardinal(Hugh Grant) tries to caution him. Lewis is the only one who opposes. Stevens holds his views very private. Miss Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson) is the new head housekeeper. Stevens gets his elderly father work with Darlington despite his failing mental and physical health. Over the years, Darlington continues to help the Germans.At the start, I would have preferred the movie to be more explicit. It would be great to spend a little time showing how low Darlington had fallen. Also I would like to have the date shown. They're very little things that eases the audience into the movie. The other minor problem is that I didn't root for Stevens and Miss Kenton. I kept hoping she forget him and quickly. However there is no telling about love. The acting is impeccable. There are a few sections that could be cut short to quicken the pace. It's a great movie but just a bit of a downer.",

The character of Mr. Stevens is about as beautifully crafted as any character I've had the pleasure to watch. Emma Thompson's Miss Kenton is his equal. The unfortunate thing is that each was born into a situation where they must never expose their emotions. What these incredible actors do with their faces is awe inspiring. MIxed in with this is the loyalty to a naive master who is trying to capitulate with German aristocrats just after the Treaty of Versailles. Hopkins is able to maintain his self imposed dignity during goings on that he know are wrong, because he trust and respects his master. This movie is ultimately about how the world of the two does not allow them the freedom to express a thought. Everything is about service; everything is about sacrifice. There is a gut wrenching scene where a pompous English lord is discussing how the common people of Europe are asking to have a voice in the political being of the country. The man asks Stevens a series of very specific questions which would have required incredible expertise to answer, forcing him to reply that he cannot converse on the subject. He is made a humiliated sight, but must go on with dignity though publicly ridiculed. The man then talks about him as if her were a child. In reality, he would have been able to converse on any of those subjects.The undercurrents of the second world war are there all the time and they contribute to the tension.

It marks the end of the expansion of prosperity, change and invention of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, that for the first time in history, brought into existence a large, educated middle class. It is the span of this society and it's events that were both passed on to us as a nation, and have had a greater influence on our modern day than any other period. As they were the beginning of the modern era. By the 1930's we come to the end of the rigid class system that had evolved during these periods. This story is in fact all about the servants and is seen from their perspective. Regular working class people, their lives and loves - they are it's real champions. I believe it to be the finest film ever made on the subject, and one of the finest films period. Easy on both the eyes and the mind, it is effortless to watch. And one of only 3 films that I find myself returning to over and over again, more than any others. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson who have so many great performances, do their best work here. Here in cinema is a display of excellence in the ordinary, and a celebration of both understatement, and unrequited love. We are only observers here in the sense that there is nothing to figure out, and what we observe is the perfect Servant. One who applies himself wholeheartedly to his craft, and finds contentment in doing his job well. A rarity in both life and cinema. I find it very telling that perhaps the finest English film was a collaboration of men from two former colonies - India and the U.S., a Japanese author, a Celt in the male lead, and a screenwriter from Germany married to an Indian, who has spent most of her life in India and America. These are the people that school us in the culture that birthed our own, and so much of modern western civilization. None of them are English.The perfect fit that I think James Ivory often reaches for is achieved here. It is a movie without sex, violence, or bad language, which are often added from a lack of strength, not as proof of it. This movie is a tribute to everything good that is England. Merchant and Ivory couldn't have done better.http://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/true-faith/",

Well, he did a superb job.Emma Thompson performs spectacularly as romantic interest and head housekeeper.

It's difficult to watch a James Ivory film and not feel contempt for the agonizing pace he sets and for his hoked-up sentimentality (as if human repression really needed to be romanticized).

Nothing more has been said when the credits roll, than when we first observed his characters issue. I don't need a happy ending or momentous developments, but please leave me an inch or two ahead of where the story began. 'Being There' covers a similarly stunted character much more thoughtfully. Uncomfortably, the image of a preternaturally calm Hopkins standing inches from an occasionally irksome Emma Thompson, makes viewers anxious about Lector-like face chomping. Christopher Reeve who never did much with any role, again does very little with his role. The cinematography is the standard \"tastefulness equals art\" Merchant Ivory deal.",

I never really noticed until a recent viewing that several times throughout the story, from various characters, Mr. Stevens is repeatedly pressed for his personal opinions to the point it becomes annoying. He is harassed by no less than five otherwise polite british people about his views on various issues, which certainly seems rude and intrusive in contemporary times, not to mention the 1930s through the 1950s. I'm left wondering why all these people are treating Mr. Stevens as some sort of freak that they can't quite figure out, scratching their heads in astonishment as they realize that he is, gasp, an introvert who prefers to keep his head down and do his job. No other character in the film is subject to this degree of scrutiny, and the story as a result is top-heavy. Who cares what the butler thinks, leave him alone. I get this is supposed to be a story of unrequited love, but it comes at the expense of a willing suspension of disbelief, and unfortunately this major flaw continues to the very end.",

It helps to know the premise of the plot in advance so the going back and forth in time is not confusing. The story is powerful and the story of appeasement in pre WWII Britain is both chilling and fascinating to watch. Makes one look at the butler's job in a different light - more like running a hotel. The Butler's role felt crucial to support the critical but misguided peace talks. The subplot with his father is touching. The screenplay captures both the grand sweep of the larger events and the intimate personal story.The filming, interiors, scenery and cinematography are all beautiful. It is Emma Thompson's best role. Every emotion is so transparent and clear on her face. Her frustration and sadness are moving and memorable. Anthony Hopkins is so convincing in the character that it's hard to imagine you are not watching a real butler. Hope he is remembered more for this role than \"Silence of the Lambs\". The scenes between them are loaded with emotion and unspoken feelings. Excellent supporting cast including the regal James Fox and a well cast Christopher Reeve.If not for the stiff competition that year including Schindler's List, Philadelphia, Age of Innocence, I think in any other year this would have swept the table.

            "content": "In the period between the two world wars, the world tried to make sure that there was never again something as destructive and traumatic as the First World War. However, such decisions, very commendable but chimerical and contrary to human nature, failed, as we know: the Second World War will occur just a few years later, almost as a direct consequence of the mismanagement of peace, so hard achieved. However, the UK (and other countries) sought to avoid the new conflict by choosing to ignore everything that was happening in Germany: price inflation, the brutal economic crisis, popular dissatisfaction, the rise of Nazi radicalism and an increasingly brutal, extreme and violent rhetoric.Lord Darlington, the central figure of this film, is the archetype of a well-bred and intelligent British political class, deeply traumatized by the First World War and more than determined to avoid another one like it. Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain and a number of other politicians thought alike and sought, by various means, to appease and reach an agreement with Hitler, after which they were heavily criticized for the way in which they did so. Honestly, I can't criticize them. Only those who have never experienced a war can afford not to try to prevent another one from happening in every way, however justifiable and even laudable the reasons behind it may be. Therefore, here begins the fundamental disagreement between the way I think and the way this film was thought and conceived.Many, in fact, would think that the butler of Darlington Hall is the key figure in this film. Indeed, he is the protagonist and the main character, impeccably played by the always secure Sir Anthony Hopkins. However, this character's actions and thoughts are strictly determined by her canine loyalty to her aristocratic lord, and the house where he serves. So if His Lordship thinks a certain way, he must be right. And although the film criticizes this loyalty and lack of moral and intellectual independence, I prefer to refrain from doing so. Like Lord Darlington, I also have people who serve me, and I learned to appreciate and value that devoted loyalty, not least because we cannot, nowadays, put anyone to serve inside our homes. Loyalty, honesty, respect and good understanding between servant and master are, more than any contract or payment, the basis of a good relationship in such a situation.In addition to Sir Anthony Hopkins, the film features an excellent work by Dame Emma Thompson, who makes a good counterpoint with the butler: if one is reason and traditionalism, the other is innovation, breaking conventions, emotion. Therefore, they complement each other and create a good friendship, despite being very different and often not agreeing. The film takes a nice approach to this relationship, making the subplot between the two a highly important point in the overall story. The film also features good interpretations by James Fox, Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant.On a more technical level, we must highlight the choice of filming locations, which built a fictional Darlington Hall from some of the most beautiful and significant English manor houses, which makes the film an authentic tour of these unique pieces of heritage and culture. Inside some of them, you can still feel the British spirit, with its chivalry, sobriety and stoicism. Cinematography is the standard used in 1993 and does not bring any surprises, although the camera work deserves a positive note. The sets, and especially the costumes and props, deserve to be carefully looked for the way they recreate the period. The soundtrack is another point that also deserves to be highlighted, being emotional and striking without imposing itself in a strident way.",

The Remains of the Day is such a film.A masterpiece. Every aspect of this film is as near perfection as it's possible to imagine. Another reviewer here wrote; \"It also boasts some of the finest performances ever put on film\", and \"To describe Anthony Hopkins as brilliant is completely redundant. His turn here goes way beyond mere acting, and it was criminal he was denied the Oscar at the 1994 Academy awards\". Absolutely so. I was shocked that Hopkins didn't pick up the Oscar - his Butler, Stevens is one of cinemas greatest portrayals. Emma Thompson should also have picked up best actress. In fact - it's quite inexplicable that this wonderful picture received no Oscars at all! EVERY element of this film; story, screenplay, music, acting, cinematography is peerless. There is no weak spot.The Novel is a good one - and it won many awards, but good novels don't always make great films - much depends who takes up the challenge of translating it on the screen. But the translation here magnifies the work immensely.Throughout, the story is one of self-denial, the subjugation of ego and self. Hopkins (as Stevens) LIVES this life and embodies it in a way which permeates the whole film. This spirit controls the piece; Stevens allows his life to be controlled by the rules of his role. Although he is clearly a thinking man, he thinks only of loyalty, blind unquestioning loyalty. He only thinks to break out after his master is found to have flawed thinking - which leads him to question, finally, why he made the choices he did earlier in his life. Now realising his own thinking to be flawed and his choices mistaken Stevens elects to try to do something with \"the remains of the day\". It's a tremendous journey.In ourselves we know throughout that Stevens is making, wantonly through actively choosing self-denial, a mistake which is costing him the happiness of his life. Because of the flashback construction we see how this mistake pans out. We live Stevens's mistakes and self-abrogation, we sense the struggle - we see his choices when confronted with them, and because the character is so well etched (and Hopkins so marvellous in the role), we see what could inform the choices he could make. But in fact - nothing informs his decision making, and he doesn't make any choices - because in his mind he can't be anything other than a Butler. His pride tells him that to be the best Butler there is only one way he can be, and that's like this - seemingly cold, seemingly unthinking. Like Stevens - we the viewer can do nothing, we can make no choices, so we become like him - someone helplessly, regretfully viewing his own life. We sense his pain - but never see it displayed. Only at the end when we understand that he has finally made the right choice is there any form of resolution and our identification with Stevens can become complete.This is a film for anyone who wants another view of human choices which determine and describe the human condition. Truly - one of the greatest films ever made.",

And the big story, the temptation of some in UK (Edward VII but not only him) to join the nazi Germany.I've first watched this movie many years ago and it still comes back regularly to my memory. Hopkins' acting is amazing. His way of conveying (suppressed) emotions through the slightest change to his eyelids is fascinating.A must see.",

            "content": "It is the late-1950s and, due to the death of Lord Darlington, Darlington Hall has just been bought by Jack Lewis, an American. On the staff of the hall is the head butler, James Stevens. Through his eyes we see the what took place in the hall over the last 25 or so years, including the lead-up to World War 2, Stevens' undying devotion to his job and master and his relationship with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton.Wonderfully engaging, interesting and moving movie. The main plot is essentially the story of one man, Stevens, and his devotion to his job. Anthony Hopkins is superb as Stevens, capturing well the robot-like blinkeredness of a butler who believes duty, dedication and dignity are everything, at the expense of feelings and expression.Around Stevens are spun a few other stories, making the movie quite multi-faceted. Among these, there's the history of the household, and Lord Darlington especially. We have the build-up to WW2, showing just how it developed, and how many were sucked into appeasing Germany in the lead-up to it.Then there's the relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton, which provides some of the most emotional parts of the movie. It also provides some great \"what if?\" moments.Nominated for eight Oscars in 1994, including Best Film, Best Director for James Ivory, Best Leading Actor for Anthony Hopkins and Best Leading Actress for Emma Thompson, unfortunately The Remains Of The Day did not win in any category.",

Emma Thompson was amazing as always giving a glowing performance.Half way through the film I asked myself, what on earth is it about? The plot is so subtle and slow that you don't realize the meaning of the film until the end. The movie in general is very boring as it moves at the paste of a snail, with no defined purpose of what it is trying to portray. The ending leaves you crushed and feeling why did I watch this?",

I would also sum up this movie as one that runs counter to all of the Hollywood clich\u00e9s and happy endings, because as much as you would expect and want the pairing of Hopkins with an equally supreme Emma Thompson, alas, this isn't a typical Hollywood romance, and why British films will no doubt remain a bridesmaid to the larger, more commercial films of Hollywood. Far from being the clich\u00e9d viewing of their Western counterparts, as in life, they often don't have those glamorized endings, instead focusing on the truth of the story, not in monster box office returns. This certainly isn't a \"chick flick.\" Or is it? As in many aspects of life, many cherished dreams and fantasies don't always come true, but in this classic ode to good storytelling, the subtle and heartbreaking pathos of the actors' performances shine though as many Hollywood productions fail to do. If you enjoy wonderful, nuanced acting, this is a film that should not be missed.",

            "content": "Somehow James Ivory is a name that I always have connected to costume drama's about the high society in the 19th century. And that's not exactly a good thing for me, because I couldn't care less for that kind of movies. It's just not my style of movie and I always try to avoid them as much as I can. Somehow, I feared that this movie would be exactly the same, although I knew that it was situated in between the two world wars. But I also knew that it was situated in the English high society and that's what kept me hesitating. On the other hand I must also say that I was quite curious about it, because this movie got such a high rating on this website (7.8/10 after 10,789 votes at the time).In post-WWI Britain, tradition and good manners are still considered as one of the most valuable goods and Mr. Stevens will make sure that his master will not lose face towards his many guests. He is the butler who has sacrificed his entire life in order to serve his master in the best possible way and he makes sure that all the other staff members are as impeccable as he is. But when the new housekeeper falls in love with him and he can't show his feelings and when his master starts close relations with Nazi sympathizers, he finds it more and more difficult to do his job in the most perfect way...If someone had told me before watching this movie that I would love it, I would never have believed him or her, thinking that they were exaggerating. But to my own surprise I must admit that I did like it ... a lot even. This is by far one of the best romantic drama's that I've seen lately. The story, the acting, the directing,... it's all very powerful and compelling and it didn't let go of me from the first minute until the last. I guess it was the obvious contradiction between what he wanted to do and what he was supposed to do and the constant tension in his relationship with Miss Kenton, that kept me interested.Another reason why I liked this movie so much is the excellent acting. I already said it before in another review and I'll say it again in this one: Anthony Hopkins is perfect to play the role of the true gentleman. I never got the feeling that he was acting in this movie. Somehow he felt so real and natural, that I immediately forgot about the fact that this was just a role that he was playing. He has always been a fine actor, capable of playing all kinds of roles, but this is definitely one of his best. Also very interesting were Emma Thompson, Peter Vaughan and Hugh Grant, who all did a wonderful job in this movie.In the end this is one of those romantic drama's that could even appeal to the people who normally would never watch such a movie. Before watching this movie I was more interested in the time period it was situated in than in the story, but even when it had been situated in the 19th century, I would have liked it a lot. This is just one of those movies that deserves to be in the top 250 list and it's too bad that it isn't right now. Personally I give it a rating of 8.5/10.",

The two had also been paired the year before in Howard's End, another wonderful (and strongly recommended) James Ivory adaptation of a great novel.10/10",

            "content": "How difficult it must be to live inside the skin of a man like butler James Stephens (Anthony Hopkins), unable or unwilling to express his emotions or even his thoughts on subjects of major import. After a while, one becomes infuriated with his maddeningly proper and reserved behavior, which allows him to carry on with his duties while his own father lies dying in an upstairs bedroom. This he justifies by stating \"My father would wish me to carry on with my work.\" Maybe so, but show some heart, man. For whatever reason, this was virtually impossible for Stevens in all matters of politics, business, and most of all, love. When it becomes apparent that his feelings for Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) will remain unexpressed, even in the face of an impending marriage while she herself harbors feelings of her own for Stevens, the story becomes one of tense frustration. On top of that is Stevens' equivocation on matters of the Nazis coming to power and his Master Darlington's (James Fox) efforts at appeasement that ultimately lead to disgrace. As dry and soulless as all this sounds, the movie itself is a masterful character study of people imprisoned by their own status in life and how ineffectual they are in achieving self fulfillment. Hopkins and Thompson are remarkable in their portrayals, and the film's ending with Miss Kenton lamenting a life that never came to pass is heartbreaking in it's intensity. Christopher Reeve also acquits himself well as the American Congressman who fails to convince his European hosts that Hitler's designs will prove frightful for all. I'm not much for fictional period pieces, but \"The Remains of the Day\" is a finely scripted story that's wonderfully filmed. Fans of love and romance however should prepare for disappointment.",

The acting is superb all round, as are the production values.

Darlington seems like a decent man but his naive view of politics led him to be manipulated by other members of the nobility to support Adolf Hitler's dangerous and racist ideology. It is at this point that Miss Kenyon tries to set him straight. This definitely goes against the grain with Mr. Stevens.Anthony Hopkins plays the seemingly \"perfect\" butler. The remainder of the the cast, including Thompson and Fox, are also superb. Christopher Reeve plays the American who takes ownership of Fox's estate and sees through Darlington's political illusion. Hugh Grant plays Darlington's nephew, a journalist who reports on the dangerous plans of his uncle the other members of his circle.A great piece of film-making, I'm glad I took time to view this film again.

Anthony Hopkins plays Mr. Stevens, a man who has given his entire being to his master and who allows himself no thoughts or emotions outside of his duties. The story has two major drives. First, his master (played by James Fox) is a Nazi sympathizer (this is in the mid-30s) and is a major force in the eventual appeasement policies that Britain took up before the war hit home. Second, the lead house keeper (Emma Thompson) becomes emotionally attached to Mr. Stevens, but, given his nature, it's absolutely impossible for him to return the affection, as much as he might feel it inside. I liked most everything about it, but I have to say the story itself was my main point of interest. I just thought it was brilliantly written, and I was deeply moved by it.

One thing that hasn't been mentioned or appraised enough in my opinion is Richard Robbins' score: simple and not particularly challenging or original in terms of melodic or harmonic invention, it nevertheless immeasurably adds to the desired overall modality of the film, probably even more so than photography, camera work, set design or other aspects of this production: subdued but gently percolating in the background, full of controlled, suppressed agitation, trepidation and longing, it knowingly becomes an extended emotional hand of the personalities and events that we see on screen. Intense yet unimposing, it's a fine example of how a great score can turn an already brilliant film into what is often regarded (and not only on these pages) as a modern classic.On another note, and this being only a speculation, it becomes more apparent that either Meryl Streep or Jeremy Irons, both otherwise fine actors (who mercifully turned down the roles offered, or weren't available) would not have achieved the on-screen chemistry delivered by Thompson and Hopkins, as these two simply excel themselves in what's arguably their finest hour on film, together or separately. And they lead a wonderfully rounded up cast, amongst which James Fox certainly deserves a special mention. Sheer movie brilliance on all fronts - do not miss if you consider yourself to be a self-respecting lover of film as an art form, and not just entertainment. Firmly in my all-time top ten.",

However,it is also a very Frustrating film,because Antony Hopkin's character is so rigid,so seemingly devoid of emotion,so steadfast in his refusal to do anything that might alter and better his life,that one feels like giving him a slap and shouting to him \"sort yourself out!\".For example,when his father dies,he simply carries on with his duties. He seems to not have an opinion on anything,such as the pro-Nazi goings-ons in the house.Most notably,there is his relationship with the housekeeper,Emma Thompson. Obviously deep down he feels something,and he reads romantic novels {a particularly poignant scene,Antony Hopkin's performance being particularly brilliant here},but he will seemingly not say anything,let alone act. It's painful to watch.Of course it's part of the film's genius that one feels such a reaction to the character. Throughout,we seem to learn bits and pieces about him ,yet by the end we seen to have learnt hardly anything about him at all. The film has an appropriately cold and distant feel,choosing to observe events rather than comment on them,just like Hopkins' character. However,right near the end,there is a devastating shot of one of the film's characters receding into the distance and filled with tears,which is all the more poignant because of it's restraint. Get the hankies.The Remains Of The Day is superbly acted,written and photographed,and yet it's a hard film to warm to. Nevertheless,the fact that it inspires such powerful and conflicting emotions raises it well above many others of it's ilk.",

In this film, he is the ultimate repressed butler who serves his employers for a lifetime much like his father who was also a servant. In this film based on the novel, he re-teams with Emma Thompson who plays the housekeeper and the woman who he loves but can't bear to mention. Emma gives a brilliant performance as the housekeeper who seeks marriage and family life. Their characters reunite many years later only to break my heart and cause me tears. The film is nothing less than spectacular. Christopher Reeve is in one of his last major film roles as the younger owner of the estate. Sadly, Reeve will become paralyzed in real life. The cast also includes James Fox as the previous owner and Hugh Grant as well. The war wrecks havoc on the estate so far away from the drama on the fields and in the camps.",

            "content": "Stevens hails from an institution of utter servitude. His end in life is to assist and complete his employer to the paramount of his capability, and as we grow closer to him, we understand that this was his sole end: He let it blind him to all of the other inevitable possibilities of life. Merchant-Ivory's piercingly thoughtful, smoothly crafted elegy for the Stiff Upper Lip is framed by Stevens' excursion to the sea, and what he discovers there. What defines this trip, in his world an odyssey, is the scenes of the past that connect the present, the moments in his life at Darlington Hall that he's truly chosen to remember, which use Lord Darlington's playing host to the world's preeminent officials as a context, in which it seems periodically like hope for Britain is being determined.Bit by bit we start to become conscious that things were not as they seemed, that Darlington was not as judicious as he thought, that Stevens, in one of Anthony Hopkins; many sterling lead performances, was blind to the truth surrounding him. Namely that Lord Darlington, before WWII, sympathized with Germany, and wanted to effect an independent concord between Britain and the Nazis. In this he was not exactly an outright bad person. He was misled, unthinking, swayed without trouble by the devoutness of well-mannered bigotry. He was, as dinner guest Christopher Reeve harshly notifies him, a layman who should've left foreign policy to real politicians.In a characteristically impeccable performance by Emma Thompson, Ms. Kenton is noticeably drawn to the manservant, but he's petrified of closeness, and evades it through an uncompromising dedication to his work. The film shows this in a sequence of hushed, virtually enigmatic scenes in which she advances and he withdraws. Hopkins and Thompson are performers so above reproach that their chemistry, so understated as to almost be invisible, is yet so strong as to power the entire film. One of the most throbbing, and inspired, of these scenes gradually tighten in on Ms. Kenton startling Stevens in his room reading a book. What book? He conceals the cover. She presses him, literally backing him into a corner, grabbing the book to discover it's a romance. She hadn't anticipated he read those. He solely reads, he awkwardly clarifies, to enhance his already masterful lexicon.Does Stevens hold any common human emotions? Very probably, which is what makes his behavior so fascinating and Hopkins so extraordinary, but something has guided him to submerge them. We meet his butler father, who raised him under an unyielding notion of service, so stern that when his father is essentially dying, Stevens doesn't leave his station at a key dinner party.The most internalized road trip ever committed to film unravels, as episode and reminiscence expose one mystery after another. We start to grasp the temperament of Darlington's manners. The lord, played by polished and elegant James Fox is not a mature man. He even enlists Stevens to describe the birds and the bees to a godson who is clearly far from a zoological understanding of sex. Encouraged by Nazi adherents and anti-Semites, he backs \"international conferences\" that sooner or later head toward Darlington Hall being portrayed as a conspirator's nest. Does Stevens hear what is conferred at the gatherings where he serves? What does he dwell on it? It's not the servant's position, he elucidates, to pay attention to his employer's discussions, or have attitudes toward them.As the political debacle of Darlington Hall unfurls, a personal one is also budding. Ms. Kenton, disheartened by her advances toward Stevens, in time flees her job. And it's only countless years later that she writes to Stevens again, inspiring his odyssey. Maybe somewhere obscured in the dusk of his dreams, there's the brain wave that she might\u0085 The closing scenes illustrate a deafeningly quiet heartbreak. The entire film is understated, meditative, reflective: An admonition to those who keep their emotional lives in abeyance. Stevens has in effect exhausted his life for the benefit of a traditional sense of duty, an illusion of permanence. He has used his \"responsibilities\" as a reason for evading his responsibility to his own contentment.",

            "content": "Although Ismail Merchant was Indian by birth and James Ivory American, and although many of their film-scripts, including this one, were written by the German-born Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the Merchant-Ivory partnership came to be seen as quintessentially British film-makers. They were responsible for some of the best-known British films of the eighties and nineties, mostly costume dramas based upon literary sources and dealing with the lives of the well-to-do classes. They did not invent the film genre which has become known as \"heritage cinema\"- that dates back at least to the late sixties- but are perhaps its best-known practitioners. \"The Remains of the Day\"- the significance of the title is rather obscure- is in many ways a typical example of their work, although the action takes place in the 1930s and 1950s rather than the late Victorian/Edwardian era with which they are normally associated.The main character is Mr. Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, an English stately home, during the 1930s. (Stevens' Christian name is James, but he is rarely referred to as such. By convention, senior servants in a household were referred to by their surnames alone). There are two strands to the plot, one political and the other personal. The political strand involves Stevens' employer Lord Darlington, an influential politician who frequently hosts gatherings of important international figures at this home. The personal strand involves Stevens' relations with Lord Darlington's housekeeper Miss Kenton, who falls in love with him although he fails to reciprocate her sentiments. (Or possibly he does, but fails to show it).The central political theme of the film is the politics of appeasement. Darlington initially appears to be in many ways an admirable character, kindly, honourable and idealistic. Although he served in the First World War he, unlike many veterans of that conflict, bears no hatred or animosity towards the Germans- indeed, he believes that Germany was harshly treated in 1919 by the vindictive Allies. His main fault is that he cannot understand those who are not honourable and idealistic, and this blinds him to the evils of Nazism; in the misguided belief that Hitler is a trustworthy man of honour he becomes an outspoken advocate of appeasement. As the film progresses, however, his own character deteriorates; he openly welcomes outright Nazi sympathisers as guests in his home, and even dismisses two Jewish chambermaids for fear of upsetting such persons.Stevens prides himself on being a model butler. He is calm, courteous and efficient, punctilious in the performance of his duties, unfailingly loyal to his employer. He regards any display of emotion as a weakness, and preserves an iron self-control at all times. Miss Kenton- we learn late on in the film that her name is Sarah, although she prefers to be called Sally- is equally efficient professionally, but is warmer and more openly emotional.The question the film raises is whether one should allow oneself to be defined entirely through one's work and through one's relationship with one's superiors. It is the same question as the great Austrian dramatist Franz Grillparzer was raising in his play \"Ein Treuer Diener Seines Herrn\". Like Grillparzer's hero Bancbanus, Stevens is a \"faithful servant of his master\"- the literal meaning of the German title- but one whose faithful service comes at a cost. In Stevens' case that cost is both personal, in that he sacrifices his chances of finding love, and moral, in that his loyalty leads him to close his eyes to his master's behaviour. When the two Jewish maids are dismissed, Miss Kenton is outraged, but Stevens refuses to utter a word of criticism of his employer, even in private. We are left wondering whether he is simply being diplomatic, or whether he actually does believe that the rich and powerful can do not wrong.When I recently reviewed \"84, Charing Cross Road\", I stated that while Anthony Hopkins is sometimes regarded in specialising in forceful, flamboyant or monstrous characters such as Hannibal Lecter or Captain Bligh in \"The Bounty\", he can be equally good as quieter, more restrained individuals, such as Dr Treves in \"The Elephant Man\", C S Lewis in \"Shadowlands\" or Frank Doel in \"84, Charing Cross Road\" itself. \"The Remains of the Day\" is perhaps Hopkins' finest performance in his vein. It is a superb piece of acting, quiet and unobtrusive, but all the more effective for being so. Emma Thompson is also good as Miss Kenton, as is James Fox as Lord Darlington. There are also good performances in smaller parts from the likes of Peter Vaughan as Stevens' elderly father, although I was less impressed by Christopher Reeve as American Congressman Jack Lewis. (Lewis' part appears to have been expanded beyond that he plays in the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, doubtless in order to provide a role for a big Hollywood name).The film displays the typical Merchant-Ivory characteristics of high production values and a loving recreation of period detail. It is, to my mind, perhaps too leisurely and slow-moving, which is why I would not rate it as highly as some other Merchant-Ivory productions, such as \"A Room with a View\" or \"Howards End\", made the year before and also starring Hopkins and Thompson. It is, however, a well-acted and well-photographed movie, and often a thought-provoking one in its analysis of interwar history and its theme that loyalty often comes with a hidden cost. 7/10",

            "content": "In many ways, this film is perfect: It is impeccably cast, gorgeously shot, with a spot-on original score.It is also a brave and interesting film, for a number of reasons - above all because it takes cowardice as its theme, and explores it deeply with an unflinching eye. We see an awful lot of films about bravery, heroism, people risking everything for the sake of others or to Do The Right Thing; the flipside is seldom explored, and it doesn't make comfortable viewing.Our protagonists here are thoroughly decent people, getting on with what they feel sort of obliged to be doing, but never quite having the courage to do what they *really should* do. With hindsight, it seems perfectly obvious that it was a grievous mistake to encourage Nazi Germany to re-arm and become a major player in Europe, however ungentlemanly it was to cripple the country at the end of World War One; Lord Darlington's refusal to face up to what was happening smacks of moral cowardice. From outside, too, it seems clear that Hopkins and Thompson are foolish not to just *admit* they're in love. In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that it seems more and more likely that the characters in question know what they should really do, every one of them is altogether sympathetic. The film is not here to judge; only to probe the devastation that can follow when people allow fear (and a misplaced sense of duty) to hold them back from doing what they should.I started out by saying that in many ways this film is perfect: There is no mistaking that it faultlessly achieves what it set out to do; this is serious art, executed with great style, with the two main leads giving devastating performances. Precisely because it tackles its themes so expertly, so convincingly, it is also a rather upsetting and profoundly frustrating film. It makes us care very much about these people, and we keep desperately wanting them to make things go right, but that is just not where this film is coming from. Life isn't always like that, you know?",

When does our conscience outweigh our loyalty? The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, but won none. This is due in part to \"Schindler's List\", which ended up winning five of those.

            "content": "A UK heritage period drama, THE REMAINS OF THE DAY arrives on the heels of HOWARD'S END (1992), also starring Hopkins and Thompson, a one-two punch from the hallmark Merchant-Ivory production, scripted by Jhabvala, the irreplaceable third constitution of the tried-and-tested creative triangle, from Ishiguro's Booker Prize winning novel. The main character is Mr. James Stevens (Hopkins), the devoted butler of Darlington Hall in England, the film starts in 1950s, when Darlington Hall has been acquired by a retired USA Congressman Mr. Lewis (Reeve), and Stevens takes his days off to visit an old friend, the former housekeeper of the manor, Miss Kenton (Thompson), who left twenty years ago to get married, but currently is single and seems to be very willing to resume her old post. Meantime, the narrative harks back to the interwar years when they work together in service of Lord Darlington (Fox), who aims high to save the world from an impending World War but hampered by his naivet\u00e9 ascribed to his rarefied noble standing, eventually falls victim to the callous opprobrium which would become his ruination. A DOWNTON ABBEY urtext in the movie's immaculate interior design and settings, Stevens plays up his restraints, which is inherently designated by the nature of his job, to an excruciating fault, that he is blindly subservient to his duty and onus, to the loyalty of his lord, averts any personal inklings toward the outside world around him or anything else actually, a working machine almost shorn of all the human emotions, among which in the cynosure is the building affection between him and Miss Kenton (or is it just a one-sided wishful thinking from her?). Encumbered by Stevens' sacrificial self-discipline, Kenton's more liberalized disposition wears thin until she finally throws up the ultimatum, and in a flurry of his dutiful engagements, Stevens detachedly refuses to take it up, which drives her away in heartbreak. But, fate is magnanimous to Stevens and grants him a second chance, 20 years later, to claim his lost chance, only this time, he is not the one who has the say, and it concludes with a heart-string- tugging bang when they depart, purportedly for the last time, and the two leading players completely channel each other into emanating one of the saddest goodbye scenes ever to the knowledge of this reviewer, however schmaltzy it seems, it magnificently turns on audience's waterworks, that's what a high-caliber melodrama capable of! Mr. Hopkins is pitch-perfect as a British stickler of his work ethic and reliably conveys his subtle but empathetic inner feelings through his lilting diction and expressions, he might be a person we cannot wholeheartedly stand up for, but we never cease emitting our compassion to him. Ms. Thompson, is given a smaller stage than her co-star, but she is a formidable force of dramaturgy, holds up against Mr. Hopkins in every scene with glint of dignity, mettle and tenderness. Peripheral characters are mostly limited in a less upstaging mode, James Fox is the quintessential goody-goody British aristocrat, Hugh Grant gives an amicable presence as Lord Darlington's godson, and the late Peter Vaughan is allowed to foreground his obstinate persona as the memorable Mr. Stevens, Sr. The political agenda of that particular period (Britain's stance of appeasement towards Nazi Germany) has been teased out exclusively through Stevens' perspectives, but his minds are downright shut out, he simply does his job to perfection and gets satisfaction from being part of the occasions (theatrically, those important nights would coincide with several life-altering happenings as regards to his life), because his unswerving trust in Lord Darlington expunges him from worrying about things of that sort, it is an easy opt-out, which visibly haunts him in his latter days and goes against grain of being a person who possesses absolute individuality and unbridled personality, A moving yarn of a radical occupational hazard, THE REMAINS OF THE DAY remains as a high achievement in period filmmaking, but loses a shade of its artistic luster in the light of its jaundiced approach of martyrizing its central character to state the obvious that is so unambiguous in the present climate.",

            "content": "Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson are two thespians who could arguably make reading the telephone book into a vivid experience, but even their copious talents are sorely tested with this pointless drawing room melodrama of manners. The Remains of the Day is yet another in a seemingly endless parade of staid British interior decorating historical dramas that propagated during the 1980s-1990s from the Merchant-Ivory stable. When the concept worked, one had solid films like Howard's End or A Room With a View. When it failed, you got The Remains of the Day.Set circa WW2, stiff, rule-bound butler Hopkins finds his narrow worldview challenged by the arrival of sunny head housekeeper Thompson, who is not afraid to lock horns with him in his British manor domain. The relationship ostensibly moves from friction to grudging respect to something much deeper.There are a number of problems that plague The Remains of the Day that hinder the enjoyment of it, despite the best efforts of its leads. Despite being sprinkled with some notable performers, the supporting cast is shamefully underused and forgettable. Everyone seems to have been directed to underact to the point of catatonia. Even Thompson, playing a somewhat more vibrant character than her cast members, seems unduly restrained here.The pace can generously be described as sluggish. This is made worse in that most modern audiences will not understand or relate to servants who give up all hope of lives for themselves in order to live vicariously through buffoonish upper crust snobs. Nothing brings this home more so than the ludicrous sequence wherein Hopkins refuses to present at the side of his father's deathbed so that he can ostensibly serve drinks to the Nazi-sympathizing lord of the manor (played on one strident note by James Fox). This episode may well be historically accurate, but it seems a foolish move to a modern viewer and fails to endear the lead character, whose emotions are often so repressed throughout the film as to make him seem robotic.Worse, there is no character arc here. We open the film with Hopkins strait-jacketed into his role as an unbending, unemotional servant. There are moments throughout where he has some obvious interior struggle, especially with the arrival of Thompson, but he never breaks through this facade. When Thompson's character resigns from the manor in protest, we again think that there will be some forward momentum for Hopkins's butler, but again he fails to change. At the climax, we are again led to believe that Hopkins may break free of these now self-imposed bonds of behavior and social class mores, when American Christopher Reeve buys the manor and encourages him to take his first ever vacation. Hopkins does so only grudgingly and seeks out Thompson, ostensibly to convey his unrequited feelings, but yet again fails to do so. In fairness, Hopkins plays the role to the hilt, but nothing can disguise that he is playing a dull man. This character changes nary a jot throughout the film; he is the same rigid, hopeless creation at the end as he is at the start. With no emotional investment or character arc, the most we can summon is some minor pity. Although truthfully one may well also wonder why so much time (and this film does seem glacially long) should be wasted on such an intractable and uninteresting man.Just in case we have not gotten the \"message\" of the film (such as it is), it concludes with a laughably heavy-handed segment where Hopkins stares frozen and slack-jawed at a pigeon that has gotten into the manor and seems trapped there. Get it! The pigeon is like him! Trapped in the manor and unable to free itself! This is for all the slow learners that did not get what was hammered home for the lengthy running time preceding this moment. Critics and Oscar voters, of course, love pretentious twaddle like this and could not resist raining down kudos, but it does little more than serve as proof that film elites really like boring British dramas set in tastefully decorated manor houses.",

Having recently reviewed The Remains of the Day, I was able to confirm what struck me as a teenager: a masterful achievement by James Ivory (it is, by the way, to praise his predilection for literary works - the film was inspired by the book by Kazuo Ishiguro, Nobel of literature in 2017) and played by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, two irreproachable actors, in their mannerisms, in the articulation of the dialogues, in the facial expressions, without excesses, all in the right dose.

Anthony Hopkins is perfect in this complex role, the writing isn't always that solid but Hopkins can just make any scene work here. Playing a character that's supposed to hide all his emotions is a challenge, but Hopkins still manages to give Stevens amazing depth. It's all in the little things I guess: occasionally Stevens will smile, but you never know if he's really happy or if he just does everything he does because it's expected from the butler. You can't look in the character's mind because he's so brilliantly underplayed. The best scene of \"Remains Of The Day\" comes near the end, when Stevens enters the room of a sobbing Emma Thompson. The climax to that scene (or lack thereof) is so fitting and so amazing. This is not my favorite movie ever because as I said, it isn't even that well-scripted or directed, but it's very compelling nonetheless.",

            "content": "Giving career high performances Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson reunite in \"Remains Of The Day\" based on a novel of the same name, by the British author Kazuo Ishiguro. It also features Christopher Reeve and the yet undiscovered Hugh Grant in a small role. It is centred in an English country house just before and after the Second World War, Plot In A Paragraph: The film is the story of 2 loyal servants - Mr. Stevens (Hopkins), the butler, and Miss Kenton (Thompson), the housekeeper - at Darlington Hall in pre World War II England. Stevens, a second-generation servant to Lord Darlington (James Fox), a Nazi sympathiser, always performed his duties with the utmost attention to detail. Miss Kenton was equally as efficient, but much more high spirited. They were clearly attracted to each other, but only able to relate on the level of butler and housekeeper. Their affection was only expressed in terms of pitched battles over domestic details.I'm disappointed to see some reviewers call this \"boring\" and state \"nothing actually happens\" as I don't believe either statement to be true. Although he appears in a limited number of scenes, Christopher Reeve adds a breath of life to this film. Reeve ad libbed the scenes where he yanked off and then threw the ambassador's shoe in frustration, as well as a later one in which he apologised to Lord Darlington for his statements over dinner. Peter Vaughn, Ben Chaplin and James Fox are excellent with Reeve in heading the supporting cast. Hugh Grant (who rates this as his best movie) also gives a great performance in his small role.",

Or when he left Miss Keaton (Thompson)leave, because he was to stay to serve his master, those are moments that require discretion of an actor, and Hopkins nails it. In the other side, Emma Thopson plays a strong woman, but unlike Stevens (Hopkins), she can't hide her feelings that well, showing insecurity sometimes, which adds a different personality in the story in a great way.But if you don't care that much about deep and intelligent dialogs, you will be able to follow the story, without worrying that much about what it's characters a passing through because of it's performances, plus the story about the Indian butler is worth the film.Verdict: You should not miss this masterpiece, because of its performances and a deep script.",

At each juncture, we turn away from a thousand paths, a thousand opportunities. That is what this film is about.There is a deep sadness in this and it will resonate with you for a long time.The acting talent is also exceptional, particularly James Fox, who is perfectly cast as Lord Darlington.Truly a life-enhancing film.",

This is almost always true (of translations, that is), and it applies to translations to the screen as well as translations of poetry.  \"The Remains of the Day\" is the rare exception.  Both book and film are beautiful, the book really is a book and the film really is a film, and the latter is remarkably faithful to the former.  Perhaps the book brings more order to the material, but that's what books are for.  Also, since the book is a first-person account, and the film (very wisely) does without first-person narration altogether, the emphasis has changed ever so slightly, but Ishiguro's material is good enough to stand being looked at more than one way.Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant are accused of having a narrow range; the accusation may even be correct (as I think it is in the case of Hopkins).  But IF the three CAN only play one role apiece, each of them plays that role here, so even if they are limited performers, they might as well not be.  Similarly, even if (as it's often said) James Ivory is a limited director (since I've somehow missed all his other films I cannot say), HE might as well not be: on this occasion, at any rate, he has perfectly understood what makes the book valuable and re-created it cinematically.  The film might as well not be an adaption at all.(If pressed, I'd have to say that the book is the finer creation.

Knowing always his proper place, the master's meetings with English traitors are matters of no concern to the butler, only that all aspects of service are properly fulfilled. It follows that he will never acknowledge his feelings for the lovely Emma Thompson, with whom he works for many years; thus the discipline of the perfect servant. This near-classic film was made in 1993 about events circa 1939; but it could possibly be more timely to events in 2006. As good Americans and good Englishmen stand tall and take the fight following 9-11-01 to the terrorists, we have among us thousands of \"appeasement\" advocates who undermine our troops, increase their death toll, and provide aid-and-comfort to the enemy. Many such people reside in luxurious townhouses and mansions in Manhattan and Malibu where they live in luxury and are waited on hand and foot by good servants like Anthony Hopkins.

It is a sumptuous and subtle character piece of a butler Mr Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) who devoted his life to duty and service. Mr Stevens ended up never having a life of his own and he did not recognise the warm feelings for him from the head housekeeper Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson.)The movie starts in the late 1950s when a former American politician Trent Lewis (Christopher Reeve) becomes the new owner of Darlington Hall, a place he visited in the 1930s for a conference and instantly fell in love with.Lord Darlington (James Fox) the former owner is portrayed as a well meaning but naive man who got taken in by Nazi sympathizers. His life ended up in disgrace when he lost a libel action.Mr Stevens drives to the west country to meet Miss Kenton and hopefully persuade her to return to service. During the journey he recalls the time when Miss Kenton started at Darlington Hall and the events that took place there in the 1930s. Mr Stevens hopes to put right the mistake he made many years earlier, letting Miss Kenton go.This is not a slow movie but it is a thoughtful one. It looks at the upstairs downstairs life of a grand house in the 1930s, the run up to world war 2 and the Nazi sympathies of some of the British upper classes.Mr Stevens was a man who had no views or he kept them tightly to himself. There is a scene where a toff asks Mr Stevens three difficult questions which he could not answer. Mr Stevens should had given the slimy toff a brush and told him to sweep the chimney and we could had seen how well he could manage to do that.I am not a fan of some of the Merchant & Ivory stuff. This is a well acted film. It was hard to believe that Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar two years earlier for playing a cannibal serial killer. He is matched by Emma Thompson.

This English manor house and his staff is a person in itself, just like in films such as \"Gosford park\" (2001, Robert Altman) and \"La regle du jeu\" (Jean Renoir, 1939).Above all it is however the film of the (attempt to a) romance between Stevens and the head of housekeeping Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson). The attempts are made by Miss Kenton, but they all bounce off on the formal behavior of Stevens. When Miss Kenton for example informs about a novel Stevens is reading, he accuses her of \"invading his private time\". One would expect that with such reactions the flirtations would stop very soon, but Miss Kenton senses that the formality of Stevens is partly attributable to fear and insecurity. When Stevens looks at a new housemaid she teases him with: \"Might it be that our Mr Stevens fears distraction? Can it be that our Mr Stevens is flesh and blood after all and doesn't trust himself?\".At the end of the film Stevens and Miss Kenton meet again after many years in an English seaside resort. With hindsight they look back at the missed opportunities in their time together in Darlington Hall. The somewhat decayed seaside resort is assisting in making this a very cheerless ending.The casting of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson is superb.

When she tells him she can't leave Clevedon because her daughter is expecting a child,Stevens's face changes,almost imperceptibly.And the symbolism of the bird escaping into the air at the end rather emphasises the point that you have to \"carpe diem \"(seize the day) in case the opportunity doesn't arise again.

Without his performance, this movie would be a complete stinker. With it, the movie is watchable, but still unsatisfying. The main problem is that the movie doesn't go anywhere. You know, the old \"writing 101\" business about beginning, middle, and end, and the concept that there ought to be a climax or resolution or something that pulls things together as you get to the final scenes.Instead, at the end you just scratch your head and wonder why you just spent 2+ hours watching this thing.If someone recommends this movie to you because your wife likes \"Downton Abbey\" (which is how we came to rent it), do yourself a favor and instead rent the very similar, and infinitely better film, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" It too has a \"majordomo\" at its center (a concierge at a hotel instead of a butler in a private residence), but the characters in that film are infinitely more interesting and compelling. That film is also told in flashbacks, but to much better effect. But the key difference is that the resolutions at the end are satisfying in all respects.What makes it so much better?

Christopher Reeve plays Jack Lewis, the American delegate, who invades the proceedings to call the attendees \"amateurs.\" Hugh Grant, in one of his better roles, plays Darlington's godson, Reginald Cardinal, a \"news hound\" who eventually agrees with Lewis and detects the abuse of Darlington's \"good, noble intentions\" by the Germans, the intentions of whose leader are not fully comprehended by Darlington, who will later recognize his own gullibility. It is within this context of large-scale moral and political conflict and international affairs that super-butler Stevens toils to keep a good house. Not only does he try, with every fiber of his being, to remain detached from the world-shaking decisions being made around him (he seems more concerned with the return of a chair to its proper place), but he also maintains an ostensible detachment from his feelings (he shows more emotion over the breaking of a wine bottle than over the death of his father). Stevens extends this detachment to his feelings for the housekeeper, Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), who, compared with Mr. Stevens, wears her emotions on her sleeve. Stevens justifies his detachment by the unwavering \"dignity\" required of a great butler, especially one in the service of a house carrying the importance of Darlington Hall. Emma Thompson's Oscar-nominated performance is earnest and superb. Her character, who is considered old by the underservants and young by Mr. Stevens, passes through a range of emotions and tactics: she offers matronly advice to a younger maidservant rushing into marriage, plays provocative detective in bringing to light the errors committed by Stevens' father, tenderly comforts Stevens when his father falls ill, chastises Stevens for his moral inertness in the face of his master's racist turn, criticizes herself for placing her needs above her convictions, and, in one of the most brilliant scenes of the film, encroaches upon Stevens' \"private time\" to pry into the subject matter of his reading material, while walking a fine line between playful mockery and seductive cajoling. The supporting cast, which includes Peter Vaughan in a wonderful performance as Stevens' father, William, is also superb. Richard Robbins' whimsical, enchanting, hypnotic music is like a good wine: somberly intoxicating. The centerpiece of the film is Anthony Hopkins' Oscar-nominated performance as Stevens, a role which requires tremendous inner energy, as we must always see that he is, in fact, affected by events, while the emotional hollowness of his verbal interactions with the other characters belies his concern. The continual bombardment of his stoicism by personal challenges seems almost humorously intentional on the part of the filmmakers, like tourists trying to make a member of the Royal Guard laugh. Stevens, who cracks a nervous smile now and again, never has a real laugh, and never pursues his love for Miss Kenton, until it is too late. Honor, duty, and dignity are the reasons given for his failure to launch, but it seems as though Stevens comes from a long line of married people, including his father, who also worked as a butler and still managed to have a family of his own. There is a fair share of upstairs-downstairs going on in the world of the film, most pronounced in an uncomfortable scene in which Stevens' ignorance of world affairs is used to prove a point against democracy, but it doesn't seem completely antagonistic; when Mr. Stevens, Sr. trips and falls, dropping a full tray of items, the \"men of stature\" he is waiting on come to his aid quickly and treat him humanely. The cause of Stevens' reluctance to accept love when it presents itself appears to be more personal than societal. Stevens, deserving of the benefit of the doubt, is more a workaholic than a sociopath, although there is a faint, remote comparison drawn between Stevens' blind obedience and that of the Nazi soldiers whom Stevens' master is accused of throwing in with. Whatever the reason\u2014a reason that seems to escape Stevens himself\u2014the unrequited love between Ms. Kenton and Mr. Stevens is a source of heartbreaking regret and sadness for this long-time admirer of the film\u2014a feeling that lingers after the final, symbolic scene in which Mr. Stevens, after having assisted Mr. Lewis in releasing a temporarily trapped bird, closes forever the window of opportunity on a chance at love, at unchaining his heart, at escaping Darlington Hall to pursue a life of his own.",

As a servant in the 1930s of course you were neither expected nor required to hold an opinion,let alone express it.In that respect at least,Stevens is an accurate portrait,but in displaying what he would call \"discretion\" for so many years he has voided himself of humanity. He may be there but there is nobody in. Mr A.Hopkins plays Stevens in a performance of masterly inactivity. Miss Emma Thompson,who for years has cornered the market for vulnerable,wistful frustrated women plays the vulnerable,wistful, frustrated housekeeper who,for absolutely no good reason that I can think of,falls in love with him. It's not so much a question of will they/won't they?,more a question of how long before she stops wasting her time and looks somewhere else? Mr Stevens fails to engage the emotions because he is incapable of expressing any.On the other hand,Miss Thompson is heartbreaking. Were it not for her,\"The remains of the day\" would stultify behind it's stiff upper lip. As it is,subsequent to her first appearance one longs for her prescence in every scene. I daresay the perfect butler should be self-effacing,discreet,super - efficient,omnipresent yet near - invisible and utterly loyal.Having said that,unless he has been made by Honda or Sony he surely should have just a soupcon of humanity? Given Stevens' near catatonic condition I cannot believe Miss Thompson would still love him 20 - odd years after his cruel rejection of her. \"The remains of the day\" is an exquisitely cut diamond of a movie,beautiful to look at,perfectly crafted and glittering under the light of Miss Emma Thompson's performance.Without that light it would be cold and lifeless indeed.",

Finally sitting down and watching the entire film from beginning to end was a fantastic experience. This is one of those films that I doubt will ever leave my memory. I can't stand sentimental melodramas -- this film made me sentimental and I didn't mind, because everything in it is expressed in an oblique way that allows me to feel like I approached the material on my own terms, as opposed to lesser film-makers than James Ivory who often feel the need to direct the audience as well as the picture.Anthony Hopkins as James Stevens, a deeply repressed traditional English butler, and Emma Thompson as Mary Kenton, the housekeeper who prides herself on independence but years for emotional connection, are two of the greatest performances that I've had the privilege to see on film. There are also good supporting performances by James Fox as Stevens' first employer whose sense of nobility leads him into an unsavory connection with the Nazi party and Christopher Reeves as an American millionaire who is Stevens' second employer at the same country estate.Although the film in general could be seen mostly as the story of Stevens and Kenton's relationship, the unexpressed love and the years of growing closer and then drawing apart, it's really a movie with a broader theme that ties the smaller characters into the larger narrative. As the author of the novel expresses on a good documentary included on the DVD, it's really about decisions in our lives that can lead to basically a person wasting his entire life away as Stevens does. Our decisions and actions sometimes arise from our deepest and best nature but can lead to emptiness and ruin, as they did for Stevens and Lord Darlington (Fox).",

For me it is an example of how particulars are used to achieve generalization that touches individuals back on a specific level.  I remember that from one of my literature courses in those ancient times of my life thirty years past when I was a student.  To make true generalizations about anything, in this case life itself, you must particularize--whatever the medium.And so it is that a story which is particularly that of an English butler who has either consciously suppressed his love or unconsciously repressed it--or maybe both--gives us the details of emotion and behavior that we recognize as truthful generalizations that are actually reflective of the details of our own individual lives.  This is in no way would-be didactive art, but actually high art that achieves the kind of communication with the viewer that becomes the viewer's communion with that art.I say unrequited love has been the story of my life without fear of revealing something private, because it is also something that, through this film, can be shared with others.  I have never been a butler or anything remotely resembling that profession, but I have known what it is to be reticent about expressing my emotions and I have known what it is to lose love through the most stupid of fears--love that might have had a chance to be realized through some basic human courage that I somehow lacked.  My ever-reserved behavior won me no wife, but many sisters who love me for being a great confidant and brother.  And now it seems to me--now that I have just seen this film--that I face the remains of my own day, but I still find myself hoping it is not too late.Anthony Hopkins has given a performance that is aesthetically perfect and emotionally profound--his acting has touched me as I am sure it has touched many others.  With everyone else who has loved and admired this film, I must declare my deepest appreciation for the acting of the entire cast, but even as they all shine, Anthony Hopkins shines just a bit brighter.",

            "content": "This movie seems to confirm that the British class system can best be understood by 'outsiders' looking in: We have the novel of Kazuo Ishigiro (Japanese descent but born and raised in Britain), the adaptation for screen by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (Born in Germany, but lived some time in Britain) and direction by James Ivory (American). Of course Scorsese made The Age of Innocence, Ang Lee Sense and Sensibility and Altman Gosford Park.This is very well written for the screen. It shows that social layering and ranking is always present under the direct surface (although outsiders usually are ignorant of this). What's of interest is not the social niceties, but what isn't said and only implicitly pointed to. When Stevens' father tells Stevens he's been a good father there is no response. The whole Platonian love relation between Stevens and Miss Kenton follows this path and the tragedy being that lack of communication is strangling their lives. In this way it's also an indictment of the class system itself. To make this point stronger their relation is the core of the story but is told against the backdrop of other events in the house.A parallel can be drawn between the bad choices of Darlington as homeowner and Stevens as butler. But while Darlington seems merely ignorant, Stevens is not but pretends to be (hence all the lies when his car breaks down). When Lewis (American) takes over the house a final opportunity comes to set things right and Stevens is 'freed' (the pigeon sequence).Hopkins not only plays Stevens, he is Stevens. For the ones who doubted about the acting capabilities of the late Christopher Reeve this is necessary viewing.Too many sideways in the story make no sense in telling the main story. Part of this is to blame by the choice to tell it as a back story. Also the politics of appeasement to Hitler in Britain could be brought stronger and with more impact. So it is somewhat strangled by its own constructional choices. But the choice to tell this with flashbacks is basically a good one.",

            "review_title": "A perfect Merchant-Ivory period drama, and in the face of stiff competition arguably their masterpiece",
            "content": "Merchant-Ivory productions 1993 film The Remains of the Day is based on the novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro and adapted for the screen by Ivory's regular writing partner Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (with a little uncredited help from Harold Pinter). The novel is a rich brew of themes and translates to the big screen as an elegant study of class, repressed emotions and unrequited love, against the backdrop of Chamberlain's appeasement policy towards Nazi Germany.\nThe Remains of the Day follows professional butler James Stevens through years of devoted service at Darlington Hall. It has a non-linear narrative, with a framing sequence set in 1958 when aging butler James Stevens receives a letter from former housekeeper Mrs Benn and sets off across country in his current employer Congressman Lewis's Daimler to meet her. As he travels to the West Country, he reflects on when she first came to work at Darlington Hall in the 1930s as Miss Kenton, when the late Lord Darlington was still the owner of the house and played host to various dignitaries from and sympathetic to Nazi Germany.\nIshiguro's novel explores the nature of class, and so too does the screenplay, with Stevens espousing his philosophy that \"a man cannot call himself well-contented until he has done all he can to be of service to his employer. Of course, this assumes that one's employer is a superior person, not only in rank, or wealth, but in moral stature.\" This philosophy is sorely tested and ultimately found wanting when Darlington becomes embroiled in plans to appease Hitler, and when he orders Stevens to dismiss two maids because they are Jewish after listening to Sir Geoffrey Wren's odious cant about race (the obnoxious Wren, played with perfect arrogance by Rupert Vansittart, is based on Oswald Mosley). And yet Stevens is too much the loyal butler to question his master, eventually confessing to a doctor who helps him when is car breaks down on his 1958 trip that he respected his master but came to realise that he made poor choices. Indeed, Darlington is not condemned outright; horribly misguided, his godson Reginald Cardinal angrily argues he makes the perfect Nazi pawn precisely because they are able to exploit his sense of goodness and honour.\nAt the same time, the film explores the relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton, which holds the promise of romance but fails to deliver due to Stevens' unshakeable sense of propriety. It's quite heart-breaking, as Stevens represses his own emotions in favour of a life of dedicated servitude, ultimately prompting a tearful Miss Kenton to choose her eventual Mr Benn, whose proposal she presents to Stevens as an ultimatum; unable to express his true feelings, he merely congratulates her. Only once does Stevens' fa\u00e7ade slip afterwards, as he drops a wine bottle in the seller and shows real emotion - briefly - for the first and only time in the film. Their eventual warm but equally restrained reunion and final farewell near the end of the film is profoundly melancholy, as they reflect on lost chances and missed opportunities without really saying anything meaningful at all.\nJames Ivory was a master of the period drama and the attention to detail in his mise en sc\u00e9ne is impeccable, making The Remains of the Day an incredibly beautiful film. Shot on location at various English country estates, it looks gorgeous, and it has a soundtrack to match courtesy of regular Merchant-Ivory collaborator Richard Robbins. But the casting makes the film as much as anything else, with Anthony Hopkins is so well cast as Stevens that it's impossible to imagine anybody else in the role. He's magnificently brittle at times (Stevens' dedication to his work is never more obvious than when he continues it whilst his father lays dying) and wonderfully deadpan at others (There's a priceless scene when a spectacularly out of his depth Stevens attempts to have discussion with Darlington's godson Reginald about the facts of life and ends up babbling awkward nonsense).\nEmma Thompson is almost as impressive as Miss Kenton, as is James Fox as Lord Darlington. The supporting cast includes large numbers of British character actors (including an excellent Peter Vaughan as Stevens' father and a young Hugh Grant as Cardinal), amongst whom Christopher Reeve holds his own as the likeable Congressman Lewis. The end result is a perfect Merchant-Ivory period drama, and in the face of stiff competition arguably their masterpiece; it remains a classic of British cinema.",

Emma Thompson is excellent, as is Anthony Hopkins. What fine performances from both of them! I had forgotten that Hugh Grant was in this. His performance was also well done, and understated. Christopher Reeve also had what amounted to a cameo; this movie was made a couple of years before his accident. It's hard to describe the plot, as there is so much going on. Hopkins plays a butler; his goal is to be the finest butler he can be, and one of the best qualities a butler can have is loyalty. Yet, he slowly (very very slowly) realizes that perhaps loyalty, when displaced, is not actually a virtue. Thompson plays the young housekeeper who is very good at what she does, yet she is (by the character's own admission) a coward. The main storyline concerns the butler's unrequited love for the housekeeper, and it is heartbreaking! This is not a film that everyone will enjoy, but the subtleties made it one that I'll most definitely watch again.

This becomes apparent with his denial of his own father's illness, his refusal to accept love and admiration from Emma Thompson's character, and his complete indifference to his master's accommodating view to the looming threat posed by Nazi Germany. The mark of a great film lies not in any amount of action , but of deliberate plot and character development and \"The Remains of the Day\" has this quality in spades.

            "content": "One of the finest Merchant Ivory film's (thanks largely to the incomparable Kazuo Ishiguro), \"The Remains Of The Day\" unfolds like a science fiction tale about a robot butler (Anthony Hopkins) who has been programmed by centuries of British aristocracy to dutifully tend to Lord Darlington, a wealthy gentleman with powerful influence over European politics.At first the robot blindly does the biddings of his masters, social constraints preventing him from questioning his programming. He sees Lord Darlington as a God, and himself as a lowly machine who must be \"dignified\" and \"respectful\" to all those above. Over time the robot suppresses all self-indulgences, feelings and personal opinions, and instead uses vague notions of \"dignity\" and \"duty\" to justify what is really an existence of servitude. This is a common Ishiguro obsession: how humans remain blind to, and justify, the exploitative class based hierarchies they find themselves within. Indeed, the majority of Ishiguro's readers do not even see THEMSELVES in the characters he writes about, and the majority of his characters readily bow to a status quo in return for both crumbs and the \"remains\" of their working days.As the film unfolds, we begin to notice that the robot's spurious notions of \"dignity\", \"duty\" and \"honour\" have brought little value to his own life. His existence would be an unhappy one, had the British class system not eradicated all emotion from this machine decades ago. To feel is to question and to question is to undermine the smooth running of the Darlington Estate, a situation which the Estate dare not entertain. And so all independent thought is removed, the robot learning to associate righteousness and self-worth with suffering and servitude, the very same bonds which throughout history have allowed nations to squander men in the name of specious causes.The robot begins his slow crawl back to self-awareness, however, when he begins to notice just what type of man the genteel Lord Darlington really is. A supporter of right-wing extremists and a friend of Blackshirts (Italian fascist paramilitary groups), Darlington also forces his robot to fire all Jewish servants in his household. The robot complies, of course, but he doesn't feel good about it. He begins to question his programming.These questions are largely inspired by Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), a fellow servant in the Darlington Estate. Miss Kenton has an ethical compass and a sense of modern individuality that the robot servants around her do not. Hopkins finds her attractive, wants to instigate a romance with her, but his programming won't allow it. He keeps his mouth shut and watches as she eventually leaves the estate and marries another man.With Miss Kenton gone, the robot begins to associate his loss with his adulation of Mr Darlington. The film then likens this adulation to fascist obedience, by revealing Mr Darlington to be a Nazi sympathizer. In a sequence which is ridiculously ahistorical (the film portrays Americans as righteous noblemen who rallied the British against Hitler), the film suggests that, not only do certain forms of blind compliance lead to certain forms of fascism, but that the British class system is itself akin to fascism, and that through the actions of modern women like Miss Kenton, we now live in a better, more free, contemporary world.But wouldn't a better film have turned Darlington into a regular aristocrat, rather than a Nazi sympathiser? Must the class system be linked to Hitler for us to condemn it? This kind of aristocracy, without having to resort to ties to Blackshirts, is already itself tainted, having been responsible numerous, unfathomable injustices throughout history.The film then ends with a bird escaping the Darlington Manor, implying that the robot has finally attained some measure of freedom and that we've now entered a new world in which old aristocratic values have been replaced with personal freedoms, our world now populated by free-spirited Miss Kentons. Of course, in reality, the immaculately dressed butlers of the Darlington Estate were merely replaced by the casually dressed caretakers of Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (another film covertly about Holocausts), whilst the leisure class itself retreated further into the shadows. There are few meaningful distinctions between the roaring twenties, when ghostly robot butlers tended to their aristocratic masters, the neo-colonial 60s/70s, and the modern age. The power structures, though now more amorphous, are still the same, capitalism constantly moving toward a form of tyrannic control (most business models are autocratic or oligarchic, becoming (or hijacking) mini-states).In the early 80s, Immanuel Wallerstein, a renowned social scientist, outlined 12 characteristics which he believed were \"unique\" to modern world systems. His aim was to show that late capitalism, in the affluent 80s, was a kind of \"step up\" from aristocracy and feudalism. By 1989, though, Wallerstein had completely reversed his position. All the presumably unique characteristics of the \"modern world system\" were also true of the medieval and ancient world systems. The point is, there was no clean transition from feudalism to aristocracy to capitalism as such. The world of the robot butler never changed, it just became increasingly blurry (there's more old school slavery today than in the 1800s, you just don't see them). Today, no society has ever done so much to raise the hopes and expectations of its population, whilst simultaneously doing so much to prevent them achieving these very expectations.9/10 - \"Remains\" was released the same year as \"Schindler's List\" and \"The Age of Innocence\", two similar films which it betters. \"List\" pretends to show the horrors of fascism, but in reality, as a solution to the holocaust, it promotes three beliefs: capitalism (\"If only I had more money I could have bought more Jews\"), religion (prayers for the dead) and passivity (\"Schindler will care for us, his property\"), the very three cornerstones of fascism. See \"Hotel Terminus\" and Ishiguro's \"Never Let Me Go\".",

The word, I think, has to be mind-blowing.There is a scene with Emma Thompson, where she teases and taunts him, eventually prising the book he has been shielding from his hand only to see that he has been reading an \"old-fashioned\" romance, rather than the joked off \"racy book\", wherein Hopkins says almost nothing, but his eyes and his body language are so expressive that it's almost hard to breath. To perform this well, you have to be matched by an equal talent - and Hopkins and Thompson had already proved their ability to play an equal game in the previous year's \"Howard's End\". Here, Thompson plays a woman who keeps pushing gently and decorously to elicit a response from the repressed Mr Stevens. Her final push (announcing her engagement to another man) and her defiant, heart-broken reaction to Hopkins' studied non-reaction is a great moment. It's a brilliant film. Fantastic screenplay from a terrific novel and masterclass performances - and for those who fear such things, there is no swooning adoration of lacy thrills or male musculature that is something of a feature of other Merchant Ivory films. Ugliness is allowed into the beautiful house where most of the action is set - and it's a bigger, better, more engaging film for that. Unforgettable.",

Anthony Hopkins, his best yet role, his unbending, blind loyalty as Stevens. Emma Thompson, her love unfulfilled. James Fox, the quintessential Englishman of upper class, Lord of Darlington Hall, who, except for an accident of birth, would have no place among men of power. A truly shallow, ignorant man. Christopher Reeve, the all American guy who is streets ahead in forward thinking and reasoning. Michael Lonsdale, the Frenchman, who can't see the clouds of war above his head,  because of his blisters on his feet! Peter Vaughan, one of the old school of butlers, and Peter Godfrey, who thinks that brandy and cigars are the weapons of gentlemen.

A sad story: after a life of total dedication to your work, you realize that it wasn't worth. During all your life you suppressed your self to leave the room for the job only. And now it is too late. All you have from now on will be the remains of the day, walked through by recurring ghosts: loves that you have ignored, all those occasions to be just yourself that you have passed over.The novel of Kazuo Ishiguro embeds this story in an elegant wrapping: the action takes place at the estate of a British aristocrat, noble guests come to participate at hunting parties, to attend great dinners, to discuss international affairs. It is the beginning of the thirties, the master of the place is actually a sympathizer of Nazi Germany, advocating for them, while his butler is simply too loyal, too committed to his work, to make a judgment.Based on the novel, James Ivory made a movie that is exquisite. The director is considered as being influenced in his style by the works of Satyajit Ray and Jean Renoir. He had great masters! The two main characters are flawlessly played by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. The butler, as perfect as a Swiss watch, as perfect and as inhuman. And the maid, trying to discover the hidden humanity behind his cold perfection, fighting with him to pull out his secret kindness that he is not aware of. And giving up after too many years .The two of them are surrounded by an impeccable cast: James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Hugh Grant, Michael Lonsdale, among others.There is an interesting scene at the end. A pigeon is suddenly emerging from the chimney, aimlessly flying through the large room. They will eventually leave it outside. It was a pure coincidence: the pigeon appeared while they were shooting and the director decided on the spot to use it. It is to meditate if there can be actually coincidences in this world! The flight of the pigeon inside the room like in a gigantic cage, an unexpected symbol for what the life of the butler has been. Or a reminder maybe, of the maid, with her attempts to make him human and get his love. Or a message, about what their lives could have been.",

He had a thousand slightly different smiles each of which conveyed a different emotion that he was supposed to be feeling. Watch in awe all you wannabe actors for surely THIS is how it is done.

Hopkins discovers through interaction with outside parties that his employer is a nazi co-conspirator before the days of early World War II. He cares little about his master's affairs and just remains professional as the superb head butler. With little time for nobody, including himself, Hopkins' character realizes how he had let his life slip by, and the woman that tried to get to know him and be his friend, Emma Thompson.

A handfull of people that are psychologically completely repressed and spend (not live!!!) their sad lives only to serve others. Anthony Hopkins, who gives one of the best performances of his career, plays a butler who knows only one thing, to serve his employer with the utmost perfection. His extremely narrow and blindfolded way of existence has made him immune of displaying a single feeling in front of anyone else and after almost a lifetime of rejected living he finally discovers his great mistake. But by that time he already looses the woman who loves him. I must admit I was fairly disturbed with this movie since I thought it was going to take a different direction. I thought Hopkins's character would realize his life was a complete waste and immediately try to change what was left of it. I also thought the scenes where Emma Thompson shows she's in love with Stevens were very scarse and weren't by far enough to convince me that she was in great agony because of his coldness. I presumed she was just angry with him because he was so uptight and unsociable, but I was apparently mistaken.Years later Stevens gets in contact with Miss Kenton, but lets things be, only to disappoint her one final time. So rather that starting fresh Stevens decides to remain a butler, knowing it means rejecting his life for the comfort of others. A very sad love story I am only beginning to understand(maybe due to poor direction, maybe to my amazement that people actually lived like this), but with a strong cast, nice photography and with some of the most unfortunate people the big screen has ever displayed. 7/10",

It's a love story cleverly disguised as a drama. Anthony Hopkins never disappoints but he hammers this one down to the floor. His persona and demeanor are fine tuned to the point of being chilling. Should have won an Academy Award. When you fully expect his character to lose control at the most obvious moments he refuses to, almost as if he is messing with the audience, showing you he can take it no matter how hot the water gets or how obvious someone else's affections are. The professional's professional. And Emma Thompson plays the role of the lovesick and heart-wrenched matron as beautifully as she is. Should have won an Oscar too. The amazing part of the story is that both people are too willful (pigheaded or stubborn are much more appropriate terms) to realize that they are hopelessly and completely in love with each other and there is nothing either one can do about it or anywhere either one can go to forget the other. You think almost constantly throughout the film that one of them is going to break ranks and tell the other precisely or at least generally how they truly feel. But no. Every time that one of them tries to open the door the other kicks it into their face and hard. They are so bent on observing what is and isn't proper that they don't do what they need to do and that is be honest with themselves first and then with each other. It's funny how people spend years living closely with someone and never realize what is going on. This film makes several points. People, as a rule, never mean what they say OR say what they mean. They would rather be polite then be forced to tell the truth. And rejection to them is viewed as being more painful than losing someone you love and care about. The having loved and lost rather than never having loved at all saying is used here and I have never been convinced that is even partially true. I think he and she would have been much better off never having to go through this but watching it acted out on screen is quite memorable. Watch it and find out for yourself.",

This is also a sweeping love story, not in the sense of physical contact but in the sense of our two leads bickering with each other nonstop which shows blind devotion towards one another. I thought this was a fascinating film, thanks to strong direction by James Ivory and great performances by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Ivory's film is about a butler named Mr. Stevens who served the Lord Darlington in the mid-30's as the Nazis were taking rule over Europe. Stevens is a proper gentleman, but he learns a little too late about the man he serves. He also becomes quite friendly with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson deliver Oscar-worthy performances in their roles. Hopkins as a proper gentleman who follows proper edicate procedures and Thompson as the housekeeper who does not like what is happening in her household. I also admired Hugh Grant's performance as the journalist godson of Darlington and James Fox as Darlington himself. Overall, The Remains of the Day is a masterful period piece about a butler who tries to stay out of his master's business, even if his master was trying to deal with the Nazis. The film also works as a love story, but in a different kind of way. I loved the exquisite cinematography of the film and it shows what a beautiful area the English countryside is. A film that shows how the upper class of England is vastly different than the rest of the world.My Grade: A-",

Hugh Grant fails at one point, but this is mainly a problem in the story; I thought it was a little too much when he lashed out at Mr. Stevens on politics, war and involvement (and puts the man in his place) - he was merely asking if Mr. Stevens would join him for a drink and they were good friends on top of that.

Tell that to the Marines, and maybe to the hiflyers of NASA too.Lord Darlington makes his point where he says that the allied victors, having got their man (Germany) on the ground after the first war, proceeded to impoverish the country, taking as spoils their treasure, their navy, their currency and their dignity. And out of the Versailles treaty was born a terrible resolve for revenge in the form of Adolph Hitler. And one can understand Darlington's (and Chamberlain's) attempts to appease so as to avoid the horrors to come. Millions dead and a nuclear holocaust. Was there another way, way before it was too late?Against this very political backdrop a human story is played out (masterfully one might add), about the sacrifices made by obedient servants who understandably do not see it as their place to question representatives of visiting international leaders. Very few servants (soldiers?) today attempt this, and those that do, end up in the brig or serving life without the possibility of parole or dead. Please!Just as James Cameron knew that only a fool would attempt to retell the story of the Titanic disaster in pure documentary terms and created fictional characters for us to gain insight, so Ishiguro, Jhabvala, and Ivory have done so in this story, where we see the personal sacrifices made by those who have no choice but to blindly follow their leaders, denying their right to a missed home life, which still goes on to this day.To discuss this film without discussing the political background intelligently rather than derisively is such a waste of the film-makers' efforts.Hear the Politics, not just the Upstairs Downstairs!",

They don't hear, they don't see, they don't think, they don't know anything, anyone, anywhere and at any time. Never will one single word stand out in the discourse of these servants, not one button be untied, not one shoe be unpolished, one hair stand upright instead of being curbed down. They are automatons that are just intelligent enough to pass the wine around and not pour mustard in the glasses. That world has vanished of course, mostly, and such caricatures of humanity have been mostly erased from our memory, especially since television has produced innumerable funny comedies on such valets in today's world. So why do they do it? To live well without having to think of any problem or difficulty? Anything and everything is taken care of? They are wing props that will never come on stage and shine but they like obscurity, shadow, shade, invisibility? Apart from that quaint vision of a quaint world that has disappeared, thanks God in any religion imaginable, what's left? People who can look on their lives and consider that they have achieved nothing, they have reached no real target, they have been no one, no one of any importance, they have shown no self pride and no self esteem because the self is just beyond that world for servants. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson play their parts with so much truth and dedication that we even believe after all it might have been a good thing. They would have accepted to be thrown alive into the incinerators in Auschwitz or Buchenwald and they may even have said \"Thank you, Sir, and I am glad I can be of service!\" It is all the more poignant and pathetic because the Lord and master was a pro-nazi activist and tried to sell England to Berlin, though he only managed to sell Czechoslovakia in Munich. Any honest British citizen should have resigned when asked to dismiss two Jewish Girls because they were Jewish and actually found a way to tell the public and warn them about the villainy that was being prepared: more than fifty million dead in the world. They are the leftovers of a banquet they have not even tasted.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

I have seen most movies of Anthony Hopkins but I didn't even know this movie existed until yesterday when I was doing some research about 90s movies.It was always a great pleasure for me to see Anthony Hopkins in a movie no matter what his role was. And his performance in this movie once more gives me a reason to watch him again and again and again.But I didn't like this movie just because of him. I liked it because of many things such as its story, the performance of Emma Thompson and other actors/actresses and the atmosphere of the film as a whole.The story of The Remains of the Day focuses on nobility and suppressed feelings. I really felt like as if I was witnessing a real section from that time while watching the movie.At the end, when I go over the whole story in my head once more, although I wished that Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton would reveal their true feelings to each other, I think I didn't feel sorry for them. Because this is the way Mr. Stevens is and this is the message of this movie in my opinion.",

Now, I know butlers have to be professional and what not, but I just think he was over the top with his job by always saying no or being faulty when it comes to others. I have to say though on the positive side, he was quite good at looking after the father before he died. I really liked Emma Thompson's character, she really knew what she was talking about and knows how to do stuff right! I honestly thought that herself and Anthony Hopkins character were going to kiss. The way the poster looked and is meant to be a romance/drama film, it didn't happen and I was rather annoyed that it tricked me into thinking that was part of the story! Seriously, can't this film just be different for once instead of the storyline being rather dull?!The scenery was beautiful including the mansion! It would definitely bring you back to the 1950's!

            "content": "James Ivory's \"The Remains of the Day\" is a movie with one of the best movie set designs that I have ever seen and it is very well made. The movie was adapted from the 1989 novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro and the screenplay was written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala who also wrote Oscar winning screenplays for \"A Room with a View\" (1986), and \"Howards End\" (1992) both which I didn't get the chance to see yet. The movie stars Anthony Hopkins as James Stevens a man who has been working as a butler for several years for a man named Jack Lewis (Christopher Reeve) during the post WWII years Stevens would eventually fall in love with a housekeeper named Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) in Britain. Ivory has been known to direct romance movies but this is one of the most well shot and well acted, it isn't a great movie but is a good one but it doesn't rank with some of the best romance movies ever made. When I watched this movie a few years ago I was left with some unanswered questions which were Who was Stevens really as a person?, Why was Lewis misguiding him and many more. Another problem that I had with this movie was that Jhabvala's screenplay doesn't help us to really figure out who the characters really as people but she does do a good job at generating a little bit of empathy for the Anthony Hopkins character. The movie also has a lot of good things about most importantly the cast, as well as Tony Pierce Roberts' cinematography which was really good, and besides the set the costumes were nothing short of brilliant. I'm hoping that the other two Ivory films that I listed are much better than this one despite the fact that I happened to like this one.",

It is quite good for a film about high class living and what it used to be like in the old days to be rich, or a butler. Basically it is showing the butler life of Stevens (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins). He has worked at a mansion for many years and his father, also a butler, has died, he is trying to carry on and not worry about his Dad, at least not in front of people. Miss Kenton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emma Thompson), a cleaner, is worried that he isn't mentioning him, or something. I mainly just wanted to see it for the good cast. Also starring Christopher Reeve as Lewis, Hugh Grant as Cardinal, Moonraker's Michael Lonsdale as Dupont D'Ivry, Tim Pigott-Smith as Benn and even Coronation Street's John Savident as Dr. Meredith. What I saw was pretty good, but I need to see it again to get it and understand why it is so great. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Director for James Ivory (Howards End) (also nominated the BAFTA and Golden Globe), Best Music for Richard Robbins, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Emma Thompson was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and the film was number 35 on The 50 Greatest British Films.

He develops an attraction to the new housekeeper (Emma Thompson), while his master (James Fox) starts negotiating with Nazi officials. Like the rest of the Merchant-Ivory productions, this movie requires ample concentration to understand the characters' multiple dimensions; sometimes it seems like you have to have already watched it to understand it!Nominated for a number of Academy Awards, the movie lost to \"Schindler's List\" (which was definitely the more important movie).

            "content": "Remains of the day is a story of regret and inhibition set throughout 1920's to 1950's Britain. Anthony Hopkins plays Mr Stevens, a Butler at Darlington hall who places the up most importance on servitude. Emma Thompson plays Miss Kenton, the head maid at Darlington Hall who consistently searches for affection from Stevens with intolerable failure. The story is a retrospective of stevens looking back over his life as he travels to meet Miss Kenton for the first time in nearly twenty years. It is a reflective story of a man re-evaluating the purpose of his life, his deeds, his actions, and his attempts to address what he sees as his failure of in-action, namely his remorse at having never told those he loves his innermost feelings. The performances are first class from both both Hopkins and Thompson, not to mention a reliable cast including James Fox, Christopher Reeves, and a young Ben Chaplin. Of particular note are Hopkins' and Thompson's reserved interactions. Both are first class at expressing a vast range of emotions, and Hopkin's refinement and awkwardness is a joy to watch.James Ivory's direction is excellent, the camera is often close in on the characters which emphasises the awkwardness felt by Stevens. There is good mix of smooth camera work and some hand held moments which keep the film fresh and moving, not to mention a few great wide shots, look out for the beautiful shot of the English countryside during sunset when stevens' car runs out of petrol. The excellent cinematography is used to its most effective in a scene when Miss Kenton is in distress and stevens enters the room , Hopkins remains off camera and all that can be seen is Thompson's face with an opened door on the left hand side of the screen. The dialogue ensues as the camera remains tight on Thompsons's face, a technique often use in Shyamalan's films.Overall, this film is gripping in an emotional sense, and even for those who are not normally interested in this genre of film should find it a real treat, highly recommended.",

            "content": "This is an example of a movie that has a fairly simple, straightforward story line yet it makes a strong impression due to the sheer strength of the acting.Anthony Hopkins in perhaps his best role (and that says a lot) is a butler in a fine English manor house in the 1930s. His entire life revolves in duty and loyalty to his master, even when this involves sacrificing personal needs. His emotional and personal life seems totally suppressed while his existence is completely absorbed in running the household and the staff of servants. A description I heard in one of the bonus documentaries (on DVD) sums it up best: the room is supposed to be even emptier when the butler is present; how's that for self-effacement?Emma Thompson comes in as a housekeeper and her sense of independence and will immediately clash with Hopkins. The movie is essentially a chronicle of the development of this relationship, their eventual separation, and later reunion after WW II. The two main characters are brilliantly played, with economy of words but each gesture and expression is filled with meaning and emotion. Especially touching is the reunion scene towards the end, seeing how the two characters have evolved over the years, each trying to break out of their past limitations.There is also an interesting sub-plot relating to the political leanings of the lord of the house, who sympathized with Germany in the pre-war years. Many see Hopkins' unwillingness to confront his master's pro-Nazi leanings as a weakness or failing, but I could not blame him for his decision to limit himself to his professional duties. Any regrets he may have later in life are (I think) mainly related to Emma Thompson, rather than politics.Still, the politics lead to many fantastic scenes in the movie with elegant dinner parties, conferences, all gorgeously produced and presented with impeccable flair. One is truly immersed in the life of that society and I have to say, it's a very impressive life indeed. Costumes, sets, everything works perfectly.Strongly recommended if you enjoy fine acting at its best, and especially if period dramas are your thing.",

For Stevens, this is a bitter irony for his hopes of salvaging what remained of his life by wooing Sally back to Darlington Hall were dashed earlier that very day when she informed him of the impending birth of a grandchild and consequent change in plans. Stevens take his leave with the same emotionless grace with which he glided in and out of drawing rooms for all of his adult life. A sad tale of a wasted life, a life of devotion to duty and the supression of any real emotions. There is so much imagery in this finely crafted film. What is not verbally communicated between Stevens and Miss Kentin (Sally)is done so via this imagery. The viewer is given ample scope to discover the messages being conveyed.

That role in itself is an excellent character study.  The emotions that Stevens shows or does not show at various points of the film are fascinating to watch.  I must say that I sympathized with Miss Kenton's character (Emma Thompson, also wonderful and perfect for the part), and I'm sure people identify with her and her frustration with Stevens as well.

Not just words - I've truly never seen better. Repression and dignity personified, tragic, complex and totally convincing. The story spans more than 30 years, but with no obvious prosthetics they age in front of your eyes with a change in facial expression and a different posture, gait or outfit. In fact there is not a bum note in the whole thing - performance, story, authenticity, emotions, realism.The rest of the cast are almost as perfect; from the ******** posh idiots (the scene where they 'prove' that politics is beyond the wit of the common man is awful but brilliant) and the famous faces; Emma Thompson (I'm more than a little in love with her here), Hugh Grant (funny, sharp-minded and charming), Edward Fox (the benchmark for posh but well meaning and so easily led due to basic morality), Peter Vaughn (dying old man, again!), Lena Headey (so different from Game of Thrones), Christopher Reeve (always great to see him doing more than Superman and sad to remember who he was before the accident). Such a recognisable crowd, but within seconds you forget the famous faces and just believe the story.And as a bonus it features 2 pubs I used to drink in as a youngster and parts are filmed in a village I grew up near and had friends living just up the road.

There are also a few laughs, one in particular involving Hugh Grant's character that is spectacular. I'm not a Masterpiece Theater or Jane Austen fan; e.g., I've a hard time with films that simply involve going from living room to parlor room to dining room and back to the living room. I like my Terminator, Section 9, Avatar, etc. But TROTD just captivated me. There's a moment of sexual tension that is almost palpable with few words, action, touching, etc. I always liked Anthony Hopkins, but have only now discovered his masterpiece. Emma Thompson, as far as I am concerned, is the English \"Everywoman\".",

But why - WHY - was the ending changed? Amputated, actually - the movie is a bloody stump of the novel.  This was not only pointlessly to fans of the book but an inexcusable affront to the author, Mr. Ishiguro.  So I implore anyone who enjoyed the movie to READ THE BOOK.  It is SO much better.  God, what a horrible waste of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thomson.  It is entirely to the actors' credit that the movie was even watchable, let alone critically acclaimed.  I could have easily overlooked the petty discrepancies scattered needlessly throughout the rest of the movie (e.g. did Mr. Stevens Sr. really have to be 75 instead of 72? I don't think so) had the ending at least been attempted.  Even despite the frequent, annoying, and seemingly pointless jabs at the utter perfection that was the novel, I was enjoying the movie (thanks only to Hopkins and Thomson) until the very end and then...oh, the horror!  What was all that pigeon garbage?  There was no pigeon!  The book's meaning is clear and powerful, but the movie succumbs to artsy temptation and dilutes (if not completely destroys) the author's message.  It's a terrible, terrible shame.",

            "content": "I've heard critics of this film say that nothing actually happens in it. All I can say is they must be blind. It is an extraordinary dissection of human experience in a real-life setting.The plot is certainly simple. A reserved and doggedly professional butler hires a smart, impressive new housekeeper to help look after a large stately mansion, and over the years their relationship hovers between the starkly professional and something more romantic, but is stifled by his chronic inability to express, or accept, emotion, or to lay down the dignity of his job, even for a second.Anthony Hopkins is just brilliant as Stevens. This is probably his finest film. Making such a character as hugely sympathetic as he eventually becomes is no small achievement. We understand entirely why she falls in love with him, even as we share her frustration at his maddening weaknesses. Thompson meanwhile is no less mesmerising as the emotionally-starved career woman ahead of her time, holding her own admirably in a man's world, and there is able support from Edward Fox, Christopher Reeve and Peter Vaughan among others.Nothing is ever truly perfect, and the performances of some of the minor players can at times be ropey. But that is a tiny fault, and is overwhelmed by the quality of the leads, the tightness of the script, the haunting beauty of the score and the awesome period detail of an England coming to terms with its 20th century decline, all of which are evoked by Merchant-Ivory in what was probably the crowning glory of their collaboration.If you like your films to be laugh-a-minute slapstick, or packed with action, thrills and shocking stunts, this is definitely one to steer clear of. But if you want to be captivated by beautiful acting in a poignantly realised setting, don't miss this extraordinary movie.",

In this case, for Mr. Stevens, love struck him in a very subtle way. In the manner of first realizing his loving feelings for Miss Kenton, he hides it, and by all means is successful in doing so at first. However, as his life begins to unravel in front of him with various turns, such as the unforeseen dealings of Mr. Lord Darlington with the Nazis and the spontaneous but yet reluctant engagement of Miss Kenton, he is compelled by sudden grief.Clearly implied at Mr. Stevens Senior's deathbed, his childhood and upraising about of Mr. Stevens was one of rigidness and fanaticism, in this case to his duties as a butler. Even his father in his own pain and suffering, with the knowledge of death clearly within seconds, sends his son off to work instead of last minute words with him. In here it is clear that his devotion, although he has in every way, is superimposed on fanaticism. It is here when the audience knows that his devotion is misplaced. He finds compassion and love in a housekeeper but once his feelings are realized, he automatically puts a barrier between him and Miss Kenton. He does not allow himself to love anyone but his work.This magnificent piece of film art shows the eye missed opportunities and the adversities of stubbornness and the absolute repression of sympathy. It portrays love in the most beautiful yet tragic way. Unfortunately for Mr. Stevens, to show any love for Miss Kenton, the housekeeper, was a matter of breaking-the-rules, more stressing, his own rules and principles. For which case he could not allow it, even in the matter of his rules and principles getting in the way of his feelings.In regard to the acting, Mr. Anthony Hopkins gives a stellar performance as the consecrated English butler. His performance is one of the best ever and although his character is not at all interesting but on the contrary dull, he gives it a sense of mystery. He is able to grasp the audience's compassion and care. For the uninteresting quality to Mr. Stevens, Emma Thompson is in every way interesting and additionally gives the viewer interest in Mr. Stevens. She plays the diplomatic and immediate yet humane housekeeper wonderfully. I don't think any actress but her could have brought tears in my eyes at the end. She has that touch and flexibility that brings a likability to not just this one but all her characters.As to James Ivory, he once again was able to capture the true essence to a wonderful novel. He has a vision to all his work and what could have been boring he made it particularly exotic and captivating.With 8 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, 'The Remains of the Day' is a magnificent piece of art.",

In another scene where Emma Thompson tells him that she is leaving to get married--I have never seen such great acting in my life!

They often kept positions for life. With someone like Mr. Stevens, his was a calling, and he treated it as such. And, the dictates of such a position required he keep the strict rules of non-personal involvement with other staff. Besides, he never learned to unbend. How could he? Kind of trapped in his upbringing and environment and the times.But Ms. Kenton was frustrating to me. She shot herself in the foot, as it turns out, with her impatience and intolerance of Mr. Stevens' aspect. She was downright waspish and disrespectful at times with him. Had she not had the \"opportunity\" of marrying for what seemed out of spite, she could have had a happy life staying in her position and relationship with the man she preferred - however limited that may have been. As it is, she ends her days disappointed and unfulfilled. There was a real possibility that had she stayed put, things could have worked out for them to get together. The new owner and new day certainly held potential for the difference in their situation. She could have helped him had her interest been less self-centered. Perhaps a lesson. Is it really love to resent a person who is not \"cooperating\" with your desires? And, to the point, does it work for you? Does it bring happiness and fulfillment?",

And what I enjoyed the most was to discover the movie. So, if I have any advice to give, it's to see the movie before you read the comments or reviews, it's worth it.This said, I have to admit this movie is a real masterpiece. The story is one of an old butler in England, to the service of an American, looking in the past when he was serving, loyal to the death, an English Lord who got entangled with the Nazis during WW2. Of course, the sets are incredibly beautiful, the costumes are accurate and enlightning, and the music, right from the start, is engaging and gorgeous. The pace is slow, yes, but like a good novel, it flows so nicely, you find yourself transported... What I liked the most, however, is the main character, the butler, and how he never allowed himself to express his feelings and opinions, just because it could have made him less efficient at his job...Even when his master was about to make a pact with the Nazis, he never tried to interfere and continued to trust his master blindly, realizing only later (too late) that he was wrong...and when, near the end, when he learns the Housekeeper he once worked with (and left to get married) will not come back to work with him for the American, you can feel, you can SEE sadness in his eyes, tears accumulated, for she is the only woman he really loved in the end...but NEVER he could let his emotions show, for it might be the end of his career, or so he always thought...but how good is it if you discover in the end that you have not been living your life, but a life for somebody else....91%",

            "content": "'Remains of the Day' exhibits all the hallmarks of the Merchant/Ivory trade-craft. Beautiful photography, a beautiful musical score, fine editing, excellent dialog, natural character development and exquisite settings. And last but not least a marvelous cast of actors at the top their collective form. Anthony Hopkins has done nothing better. His restrained portrait of the Butler, Stevens, is one of the finest attempts at the portrayal of true servitude, without suffering, that I have ever seen. I say, without suffering, because I don't think Stevens suffers. I think he is very aware of what others experience, as far as close emotional attachments and self-expression, but does not particularly covet those things. He is something we don't understand anymore, someone who lives to serve, in the best sense of the word. I also do not think Stevens is a naive person; though perhaps sheltered by the circumstances of his career, he fully knows HOW to find out what's going on the outside world, if he wanted to. Emma Thompson's housekeeper, Miss Kenton, is from that outside world and attempts to broaden Mr Stevens' horizons by forcing him to face what she thinks are his own self-imposed limitations. She is right, or course, in that Stevens does indeed impose limitations on himself, but she also has a hidden agenda. She is in love with him. Perhaps he loves her but that is something he has sacrificed, willingly, to perform his job to the best of his abilities. We might not understand this attitude now but those were different times when the feudal spirit was still flickering in its last days of existence in England. All gone now.I found 'Remains of the Day' to be a fascinating glimpse into the day to day activities in a great house run along the lines of ancient traditions, and it is also an attempt to portray our struggle with ourselves and our consciences; cowardice resulting from fear, breaking the bounds of tradition, love vs. duty and honor and all that self-help sort of thing.The only truly false and ridiculous note in the film is when Lord Darlington asks his butler to explain the facts of life to Darlington's God-son, Hugh Grant, a young man in his twenties. This was totally absurd and I doubt if the most empty-headed, negligent peer ever known to man, whoever he might have been, would have given the facts of life a second thought. Most schoolboys learned about sex at a very early age within the English public school system and by other more sophisticated means at their disposal. I suggest reading books by Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene for the real skinny on that topic.I also found Congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve) to be a highly fictional creation. America did not give a damn about World War 2 until well into the fighting action, and France and most of the Continent had fallen to Hitler's army, only then did F.D.R. come to the aid of England. In the mid 1930s when this film takes place, America was not concerned with German aggression. In fact our Ambassador to the court of St James, Joseph Kennedy Sr, was an admirer of Hitler, resulting in F.D.R. calling him back to Washington and giving him other work to do. He was an embarrassment but still America did not act in the interests of England to cut Germany off at the pass BEFORE a war was started. Reeves' speech, therefore, at the great dinner is completely bogus and the creation of a modern author looking back and using his creative imagination to put forth an anti-aristocracy diatribe out of the mouth of Congressman Lewis.The other historical figure shown in this film is Sir Oswald Mosley, though under the name of \"Sir Geoffrey\" something or other. He is portrayed as a grim-lipped monster, quite unlike the true personality of Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, aka Black Shirts. Mosley had a large following among average British citizens of the day and it wasn't until the press and the communists put him in their sights that he was arrested and imprisoned for the balance of the war. Prior to the formation of the B.U.F. Mosley was widely considered one of the most brilliant politicians in Parliament and was often considered as a possible Prime Minister. This aspect of the truth was entirely ignored in the portrayal of \"Sir Geoffrey\" who was simply shown as a nasty little vegetarian bully spouting Hitlarian epithets, something Oswald Mosley never did. This isn't to defend Mosley or his B.U.F but simply to highlight the interpretation of history that has been put into the script. So why do I like this film? I'm not sure. I love the house and its furnishings and the activities of the below-stairs staff. The chemistry between Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins is fascinating. In the end I enjoy it is a glorified house-tour wrapped up in a well-written dialogue. I don't see this film as being particularly tragic, or about thwarted love, on the part of Stevens anyway. As Miss Kenton comments upon getting hold of a book Stevens is reading in his room...\"It's just a sentimental old love story.\" That would describe this film from Miss Kenton's point of view, but not from Stevens' I think. He would have viewed this film as a tale of all the undermining political forces that brought about the downfall of an ancient and noble tradition in England, and he would not have liked it at all. A melancholy and often touching film which is beautiful to watch, and little more.I give this film a 6 out of 10.",

This stylish beginning by director James Ivory (along with his usual partners of producer Ismail Merchant and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, also responsible for those peerless adaptations of E. M. Forster's `A Room With A View' and `Howards End') typifies the whole of this beautifully crafted film, based on Kazuo Ishiguro's Booker Prize novel.  The gorgeous cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (`Howards End') ends with an equally memorable aerial scenic panorama of the hall and its estate, whilst throughout careful attention is paid to the story and its characters, and not just the detail.\nTold in flashback, the events begin in 1958 with the butler Mr. Stevens (Anthony Hopkins a stratosphere away from Hannibal Lecter) taking a break from his employ to visit the former housekeeper, Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson; `Sense and Sensibility') to try to entice her back into service for the new owner, ex-congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve as a typical American, prior to his tragic paralysing accident in 1995) who was previously a guest of Lord Darlington before the Second World War.  Lewis inadvertently touches a raw nerve when he jest's to Stevens if his intended recruit is an old girlfriend.On his quest to reach his old helpmate now in retirement in a friend's boarding house in Cleveden, Stevens has a chance to reflect on his original impression of Miss Kenton and it becomes clear that he realises all too late the missed opportunity.  Stevens' failure to recognise Kenton's love for him and his feelings for her lead to at least two unfulfilled lives with Kenton's marriage to another colleague, Tom Ben (Tim Pigott-Smith), also breaking down.  Although Stevens' attempt to abrogate his obvious mistake after some twenty years is sadly in vain, his reformed character offers the kindly personal counsel to the now Mrs Ben to do all she can to make her years happy for herself and her husband.  This is a salutary tale of a life obligated in the service of others at the sacrifice of oneself.  The film's message is plainly about finding the balance between serving others and remembering the duty to yourself, no matter how late in life you come to realise this. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson (reunited from the previous year's superb `Howards End') as the stiff fealty bound butler and the devoted housekeeper, provide us with two of their career best performances, painfully involving us in the tragedy of love denied.  The interplay between the two protagonists brings out the nature of the tale to heart-rending precision, shown most noticeably in the scenes where Kenton surprises Stevens reading a romance novel, and when she is found sobbing by him, after announcing her engagement and intention of leaving, he can only insensitively talk to her of a dusting detail that has been overlooked. The visual and narrative interpretations do full justice to the author's artifice of observing the world narrowly through Stevens' mind.  The domesticity of the hall is observed in minutiae against the backdrop of world politics, whilst the owner, Lord Darlington (a typically urbane James Fox), believes that Germany was unfairly treated after World War I, and is determined to help `her' regain international standing.  The history here patently reflects on Neville Chamberlain's infamous `piece of paper' (Munich Agreement) in 1938 and his appeasement policy over the two years leading to the outbreak of war in 1939 when perhaps decisive action earlier could have altered things.  Ill-informed military intelligence regarding German rearmament was equally as culpable as political and religious (especially Roman Catholic) weakness, as well as the unjust Treaty of Versailles itself. Lord Darlington's appeasement conferences and his links with Germany, which led to the term \u0091Traitor's Nest' being coined by a newspaper, are also a thinly veiled reference to the Duke of Windsor's collaboration with the fascist regime.  Congressman Lewis criticises the gentlemen politicians as amateurs, blind to the realities of the world around them, and urges them to leave foreign affairs to the professionals. Stevens' loyal servitude is unquestioning of his master's politics (whom hindsight would show was misguided in his pro-German and anti-Semitic stance, rather than inherently evil) regarding it as not his place to have any views.  Both men come to realise after the War that Lord Darlington's sense of honour, along with his gullible nature and good intentions were taken advantage of till he became a dupe of the Nazis.  When Kenton confesses to Stevens of being a coward and afraid of being alone, in failing to fulfill her threat to leave when their Lordship dismisses two German girls for being Jewish, he can only restrict himself to stressing how important she is to the house. Noteworthy roles are also provided by Hugh Grant, who for once is non-stammering as Lord Darlington's godson amused by Stevens' euphemistically vague attempts, under his employer's absurd request, to explain the facts of life regarding `birds and bees'; and Peter Vaughan (his many TV credits include `Porridge' and `Our Friends in the North') portrays Stevens' father as repressed of human emotion as his son, but in his case who obviously allowed himself the luxury of indulging a biological need at least once.  When during a banquet Stevens senior collapses, his son stubbornly refuses to leave his post, in the interests of his blind sense of duty. Although this film was deservedly nominated for several key Oscars and Baftas in 1994, it was, together with Martin Scorcese's similarly themed `The Age of Innocence', and another nominated role for Emma Thompson for `In the Name of the Father', unfortunately eclipsed in an outstanding year by Steven Spielberg's harrowing `Schindler's List', as well as Jan Chapman and Jane Campion's highly original `The Piano'.",

It is still one of my all time favourite books with a story that is just so heartbreaking I feel it even while writing this review! Since the film had been around a few years at that point, our teacher proposed we watch it and see how it compared to our own vision of the book and our own emotional response. I have never seen a movie adaptation of a book that wasn't, at least a little, disappointing but this blew me away. It is clear that everyone involved from the director and actors to the lighting and costume knew the book inside out and felt it as much as I did. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson portray more in facial expressions than most actors can do with a whole career of dialogue. The scene where Mr Stevens sees Miss Kenton's silhouette at the window, in my opinion the point at which he knows he is in love with her, is handled subtly but pointedly. Although it is hard to objectively consider the film alone since I had the prior knowledge of the book, I think it does everything right to bring Ishiguro's words to life.This is, undoubtedly, one of the saddest films (and books) ever produced but you absolutely have to see it. In a way, these characters exist to show you the consequences of ignoring love, the most powerful force in the universe.",

It is the finest film I have ever seen, in acting talent, attention to detail, the excellent story and the relationship between the two central characters and their repressed love for eachother, Mr. Stevens and Miss. Kenton. This film is the only film that has ever made me cry and continues to do so, even though I've seen it now about 10 times. You will find yourselves, I promise you, shouting at the reserved Mr. Stevens \"Tell her!\". Some characters you will find yourself instantly hating just because they have any sort of contatct with Miss. Kenton simply because you know Mr. Stevens is so, so in love with her and she like wise yet they never ever tell eachother. The underlying story of the tensions before the second world war is also entertaining as is the fate of their employer Lord Darlington.Being English the whole film also highlights an England lost and a reserve and restraint that in some cases still exists within our country.Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Amazing. You have to see this film. A cliche, I know, but get the Kleenex in.",

            "review_title": "More complex than readily appears....",
            "content": "I found the movie troubling and more complex than it readily appears. Stevens, the Butler, is eyewitness to history where British appeasers of 1936 are to meet with Ribbentrop. I found the movie very similar to Peter Seller's BEING THERE, a person who is \"there\" and not altogether 'there'. Being Butler, Stevens (played by Anthony Hopkins) is sort of sworn to a weird monastic order surrendering all to a Master/Lord. He does not quite comprehend and he learns this bitterly when one of the guests quizzes Stevens and he answers with something like, \"I don't know\" and the guest then goes on to indict the notion of giving the universal vote to those unlettered (like Stevens) in the complex issues of the day. Stevens then goes on to better himself by reading so as to be properly informed.Cardinal, a godson pressman, is the moral fulcrum of the movie. He knows something is amiss with Lord Darlington's Appeasement Policy; prior to the war, Appeasement with Hitler was all the rage amongst the British Upper Class, including Lord Halifax. King George VI had to decide between Churchill or Halifax for appointment as Prime Minister; though the King leaned toward Halifax, he ended up choosing Churchill.Stevens, the Butler, knows nothing of these matters, and cannot think on these matters; made me call to mind: \"Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to do or die.\" I was starting adult-hoot in 1965 and thought if the government saw fit to go to war in Viet Nam, who was I to question the government? I held on to that notion for a long time.Stevens ends up being more than a butler; he is the paradigm of all people caught up in massive gut wrenching and life trembling events. Even as we live with them now in the present day with Der Trumspter and Covid-19 Pandemic. You would be surprised at how many people (or not) who mistakenly think we should all be a-political, or there should be NO politics in Congress (a contradiction of rationality) unmindful that politics is like the air we breathe. At some point society has to decide whether it should side with the Tory Party (Loyal to the King) or Whig Party--preferring separation from Britain. At some point society has to decide whether Slavery is acceptable by law (State's Rights) or whether Slavery is a violation of the Moral Order (Abolitionist). At some point, society has to decide about what actions to take against a Tyrant like Hitler (War or Appeasement)--and so as History unfolds, society finds itself being forced into political alignment with one idea or its polar opposite. And we cannot claim to be \"just servants\"; we must be informed. With realization that there is a \"wrong\" side to these questions.REMAINS OF THE DAY is not just a picture of the Servant Class mirroring the Upper Class, the Downstairs mirroring the Upstairs. Though is does that very well and very faithfully, like GOSFORD PARK. It does something far more valuable and insightful.",

Don't see this movie with a political sense, rather an open mind and as a colonial drama.The Good - The movie touches upon the themes of romance, servitude, honor, morals and drama. The title \"Remains of the Day\" is so well suited as in the end what is left with you is of your own doing. Stevens (Hopkins) tends to stay blind throughout the movie regarding his master to be high in morals and owing a lifelong servitude to him. He even brings in his father whom you can see is uptight as him. He chooses to sacrifice his personal happiness just to serve his master. He sees himself in the end with nothing but the remains of the day.The Bad - Although beautifully written, the pace of the movie is slow. It's a flat laid out drama movie. Other than that I find no flaws in the film.What the movie shows us is that there is a fine place and time for honor, happiness and loyalty. You can't seem to choose all at once without the loss of the other. The ending of the movie is also a tearjerker because you are a part of Steven's history in watching him and knowing what he has done on his own accord, can't feel anything else but sympathy for him.",

            "content": "It may be the most British movie ever. It is a very good illustration of British stoicism, a sort of stereotype that people from Britain are reserved to the point of being repressed. The story centres around it. It can almost be considered a case study of what happens when this stoic resilience is take to the extreme. Extreme Britishness that is. All the characters, at varying degrees, are confronted with situations in which they need to take action or express disagreement but choose not to. Because it is not quite proper I'm afraid. The film shows how this is prevalent at the castle and in the upper rungs of society. It shows more importantly how it is self-enforced and the psychological toll it exerts on people.At heart it is a movie about psychological rigidity, but applied to a social structure, to a group of people. Notably, the only American character is not affected by it. He speaks his mind freely and is open and honest with others. He is also the only one who is better off at the end of the film.The butler is unable (more precisely forbidden) to show emotions, declare his love or grieve his father. The housemaid is equally unable to communicate directly and clearly. They do communicate their feelings but only and always indirectly or under the guise of talking about work duties. The Lord also is a prisoner of his own status and is unable to connect with his staff, and arguably also with his guests. The movie shows that in this very hierarchized pre-war British society, human emotions are subordinated to social norms.I was engaged by the film, it is beautifully made and well acted. It is a beautiful display of that British Countryside aristocratic life.Yet, I was a bit disappointed at the end. You kinda want to go: \"That's it?\". The movie builds up to something greater with the Lord's intrigue and you feel that the disconnect between the political stuff and the more mundane activities of the staff will break and lead to some sort of confrontation or resolution. However the film never really resolves the tensions it presents. The Lord gets his comeuppance off-screen and the muted love affair between the butler Stevens and the housemaid Ms Kent resolves rather unsatisfyingly. They both are unable to break through that British upper lip stiffness that lead to, by their own admission, them being miserable and unhappy.None of this is bad, there is something genuinely cathartic here. Yet, I am frustrated that the movie shows these people having an introspection and being close \"to getting it\" but still missing it at the end. In other words, there is not much of a dramatic arc here, it feels more like a straight line.",

Of course the movie has a pretty good ending but the most part of the the story is slow (as it should be. that's why you wonder what's making me like it? The answer is simple, Anthony Hopkins. He makes the movie flows, his character is just a butler but he still makes an outstanding acting out of it. No doubts it's one of the most brilliant acting ever seen. With a character that has nothing but simplicity and must keep his thoughts for his own, Hopkins manages to bring life to someone supposed to dead, he makes us like that perfect butler -quiet, responsible, rigorous. His acting is so perfect that you can't understand how he did it, how he brought life to James Stevens. You can watch the movie over and over but you will still make the same question: How he did it? If you wanna see one of the most perfect acting ever seen, you must watch this movie. It's incomprehensible how Anthony Hopkins did not win the Oscar; NO ACTOR COULD EVER DO WHAT HE DID! ; and the reason I say that is the fact we are unable to understand why, during the movie, we feel empathy for someone we shouldn't, someone who is only a butler, a man of very few words and controlled gestures. Anthony Hopkins, in this movie, brings life to a character that was created not to have one; that's why this movie is so amazing and his acting perfect. Certainly deserved the Oscar!",

            "content": "THE REMAINS OF THE DAY (A-) follows the comings and goings of the fictional Lord Fox's major British country home Darlington House just before and after World War II. The story centers on Anthony Hopkins' loyal butler Mr. Stevens (we never learn his first name) who runs the house at the highest of standards for Lord Fox. In talking to another butler, Stevens reveals his personal philosophy, \"Mr. Benn, a man cannot call himself well-contented until he has done all he can to be of service to his employer. Of course, this assumes that one's employer is a superior person, not only in rank, or wealth, but in moral stature.\" Stevens' view is the mindset that dominates British society. To be \"in service\" - to be a maid, butler, housekeeper, etc. - in the Britain of old meant to make your entire life subservient to the pleasure of the aristocratic. A good life \"in the service\" was having the dignity of serving someone higher and assumedly better than yourself. Stevens believes this to his core and the film's story goes about subtly challenging that view again and again. Where does our value truly come from? There first come challenges in the obvious ways, like never being called by your first name, doing hard work, living within the grounds of the great manor house. However, the film introduces smaller challenges like when Lord Fox asks Stevens to help share the truth about \"the birds and the bees\" to his adult godson (Hugh Grant) because it would be easier coming from Stevens. In another thread, Stevens invites his frail father to come work at the house as an under-butler. When it is clear Steven's father has taken ill and likely on his death bed, it is clear that Steven's is torn between his duty to serve the Lord (they are having an important dinner at the time) and the duty of a son. Stevens later hears of his father's death and won't immediately attend to him so he asks the housekeeper Ms. Kenton (Emma Thompson) to close his eyes for him. When he does later check on his father, it's a short moment, and Steven's ends it by asking the doctor to check on the feet of the house guests. Speaking of Ms. Kenton, the two are largely in charge of running the house and though they butt heads at times, it's clear that there is a chemistry between them. When Ms. Kenton drops hints that she is open to something more, Stevens clearly feels torn between sharing his feelings and the thought that his entire life, even his love-life, is given over to the Lord he serves. Ultimately, he shoves down his feelings and puts on a good business face as he loses his chance with the lovely Ms. Kenton who goes off to marry another man late in the film. Throughout all of this, Anthony Hopkins' performance is a masterclass of subtlety - always hiding the conflicts beneath the surface without becoming a complete cypher (this is much harder to do than you think.) The final thing the film challenges Stevens' on is giving over his political voice/moral judgment to his Lord as well. The film, despite being largely fictional, gives us a glimpse into the politics of pre-World War II Britain and how Lords who saw themselves as integral to international affairs, hosting world diplomats and having conferences at their manors. It turns out that his Lord Fox favored appeasement of Germany and worked (well-intentioned) hard to that end. When discussions of the war and the Jews come up, Stevens is silent and demurs to the \"moral superiority\" of his Lord. We are treated to a framing story of Stevens after the war and downfall of his Lord, when the house is purchased by an American diplomat. Stevens wants to rehire Ms. Kenton and as he travels the countryside he finds himself hiding his affiliation with Lord Fox - ashamed of the reputation he deserved. More insightfully, it's clear that Stevens realizes what a mistake his life was, that to have given over to Lord Fox was a foolish thing to do, and the pain of his regret is quietly moving. This is absolutely one of the best British costume dramas. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Mr. Stevens is a great character study and window into a world that wasn't as long ago as we'd like to believe.",

However, Lord Darlington, being honorable and gullible, is deceived by the Nazis as he develops relationships with them under secret occasions. Mr. Stevens having total faith to his Lord, as a butler owes to, keeps serving him without any suspicion.Secondly, the sentimental relationship between Mr. Stevens and the house-keeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson).

(And not just emotionally, but he also appears to be completely celibate.) Many speak about the burden of his job, but by the end of the movie he has far less to do (and much less staff to manage), plus must be sitting on over 40 years of savings. Why is he so stuck, and emotionally stunted? Was he born a little \"off,\" or had he suffered a devastating loss? The same goes for Emma Thompson's character, Miss Kenton. Why would she attach her heart to someone so devoid of love and warmth as Mr. Stevens? Some young women go through the \"hot for aloof-guy\" period, but they usually get over it. And at least the bad-boy aloof guys throw the girl a bone once in a while. Stevens never threw her so much as artificial nib-let. Why would Thompson's character long for this humorless, wooden-souled man for decades? It's not enough to say that they were hindered by their \"position in life,\" as Stevens own father was a respected Butler, and thus living proof that one could be both an Butler *and* a husband/father.I don't mind the occasional sad story filled with melancholy and regret, but I like to see fully-formed characters - even if they are not actually fully-functioning people. The movie had plenty of time to fill us in on a few specifics.Still, the acting is great. Hopkins is at his understated best, and Emma Thompson, (from the bus scene in this movie to her reaction to her Christmas gift in Love Actually) continues to kill us with her depiction of a devastated heart.",

If you know what some of the English establishment was up to in the late '30's, you'll enjoy seeing it played out on screen; if not, you'll learn as well as being entertained. The relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton is developed very well. The way in which Stevens comes to realise how his loyalty to what he saw as \"duty\" has cost him the chance of happiness; and Miss Kenton regrets the wasting of years in what becomes a loveless marriage is at the centre of the story. But for me, the most enjoyable theme is how Lord Darlington (superbly played by James Fox)genuinely believes that war with Germany can be avoided by working with the Nazis; then, when he realises that he has been taken for a fool by them, is left a broken man. His character is counterbalanced by that of Cardinal (one of Hugh Grant's best performances)who, with the passion of his youth, argues that the Nazis can't be trusted, and that confrontation is the only way to avoid disaster. And in a poignant irony, Cardinal goes to war and is killed for his beliefs, whilst Lord Darlington is left to face his guilt and naivety, and the loss of his entire way of life. One of the high spots of the movie is when,on the eve of war, Darlington presents a lost and forlorn figure sheltering from a violent thunderstorm - an allegory for the breaking of the political storm clouds that led to world war. As his staff run to flee the rain, just as many ordinary people ran to survive a war, and often failed, Darlington is a sorry bystander who can do nothing but live with his regrets. His pre-war guests, for the most part anti-semitic, arrogant snobs, who aimed to benefit from German invasion by collaborating, or from a war by profiteering, are nowhere to be seen. First rate.

It covers all the main points of the book and remains accurate. The only major thing they changed was that Mr. Lewis-the American senator who attended Lord Darlington's international conference on Germany- became Stevens' new employer, not Mr. Farraday. The ending was very good, too, especially because Stevens and Miss Kenton are both crying when they part, possibly for the last time. The movie overall captures the essence of the book because you can really understand how Stevens is feeling: he looks back on his life and realizes that it meant nothing. It's devastating and if you're particularly sensitive, you'll probably cry.",

May have even seen it at the library and thought I should give it a try. It's a great book! I think about it a lot, which is why I rank it as one of my Most Influential Books.Little hazier on how I found out about the movie. I saw it once with Mom's mom -- maybe not long after the author had won the Nobel prize, because it was a little while after I had read the book and I remember remarking that the film's ending wasn't how I remembered the book's ending.Reread within the last year, but not all the way through. Must have stopped a little before the part about the Jewish maids. Tension builds up differently in the movie from the book. An example is at the conference held at Darlington Hall and attended by an international \"who's who\"; I remember being in more suspense about what the Frenchman's final decision would be. Another example is Mr Stevens reuniting with Miss Kenton. Seems like in the book only Miss Kenton sent a letter; they weren't trading letters or in correspondence in any way.The characters are different than I imagined them. Mr Stevens Sr in the film was more worldly and unrefined. Although that change made the viewer more sympathetic to Miss Kenton's perspective, I thought. Mr Stevens Jr, too, I read as being more rules-bound, almost robotic. The film did keep an idiosyncrasy that stood out to me from the book, where Jr addresses Sr as \"Father\" in third-person. It struck me as maybe a Japanese (the author's nationality) mannerism, though I don't know much about the culture. A feeling of the similarity between Japanese and English senses of honor, which I got from reading the book, I also got from the movie.The philosophy is what I like best about the story. The book answers \"What is dignity?\" in a way similar to how Plato's Republic answers \"What is justice?\" (Another, more direct comparison might be to \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\" in which the philosophy is interleaved with both an autobiography of the protagonist as well as a road trip during which he unwinds his life for the reader to view.) Some of the dignity question shows up in the movie, although there are parts omitted from the book that could make the point more strongly.What I feel both book and movie do very well is get their audience to think about the phrase \"the right side of history.\" Lord Darlington, driven by a promise made to a German friend while fighting the first World War, seeks to use his influence as a nobleman to preserve the peace. And Mr Stevens, his loyal-to-a-fault butler, finds himself and his master on the unpopular side of a sudden and severe change in the shifting winds of public opinion. I see a case for both sides. I think many are familiar with the anti-Nazi sentiment of WWII. But then: forgiveness and pardon and peace; an end to prejudice and conflict; validation and membership in \"That Great Big Brotherhood of Man\" -- surely, these things are on the \"right side of history\" too? Who am I to say who is closer to this utopia than another?Focusing less on the dignity question takes away for me the hardest blow of the story. Mr Stevens is committed to the idea that excellence in his craft comes not only from the finest attention to detail but also from serving with utmost devotion a household of high moral character. Mr Stevens also manifests an unquestioning, part \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" and part \"I was only following orders,\" obedience to Lord Darlington's wishes. So in the book when Mr Steven sets aside his relationships with his equally work-centered father and also with his love interest Miss Kenton, and unflinchingly grants Lord Darlington's requests like the one to fire maids because they are Jewish, the cut is especially deep when the Darlington estate falls into disrepute in a public scandal over their dealings to prevent war.While not as I imagined, the movie is very good. Especially the acting from stars like Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Christopher Reeve, and Hugh Grant. If you enjoy the movie, I highly recommend the book!",

This feature involves the finest acting in the history of quality drama, engrossing direction, beautiful cinematography and a hauntingly appropriate score that reflects the currents of this most challenged love story. What does remain at the end of the day?Nominated for 9 Academy Awards in 1993, the film received none - one of the most inconsiderate and unfair practices by the Academy.",

This time I was particularly strung by the frustration of Cardinal (Hugh Grant) when he found out that his beloved godfather Lord Darlington was making this mistake by trying to appease Britain and that \"lot of criminals from Berlin\" and mr Stevens seemed not to be interested. But what subtlety overall and what acting talent and filming.",

Acting is good, setting is good, but this does not make a film worth watching.The character Hopkins plays is an automaton. This central character is so emotionally dead and unrealistic that it ruins what could have been a good movie.The film is a fraud because Hopkins character is a fraud. There is no point sitting through this tripe. Even the most emotionally restrained male cannot prevent his emotions leaking through here and there. But NO! The director shows us no evidence of any emotion at all and we are supposed to believe this.Can't believe IMDb members have rated it at 7.9. From now on I'll be reading some of the 'Hated It' reviews as well as the rating.This film has little or nothing to offer and was certainly not worth an evening of my time.",

As for Miss Kenton, one feels so sorry for her.  She has so much love to give Mr. Stevens, but just can't quite reach him.This movie is one of the best I have seen so far as playing with your emotions.  Just wish they would make more like this. A must see for anyone who wants a good and interesting storyline, and acting beyond reproach.",

I have seen this movie 20 times, at least, and I am ready to see it again and again. Some might consider it a bit \"slow\" but that adds to the beauty of the drama, the soundtrack is also extremely sophisticated. what else can I say? this movie is one of the best ones made in the 1990's. and the actors proved again how Great they really are. Watching this is a MUST for all people who love drama and sophisticated British/American actors. I can only recommend to everybody to go and see this movie. It is very sophisticated and mature, not shallow at all. Truly a work of Merchant-Ivory, very typical of them.",
