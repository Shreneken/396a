            "content": "Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Mel Brooks, but from cinema itself.  Film stars Cleavon Little as a regular black laborer, but then a villain (Heldey Lamarr is perfectly played by Harvey Korman) wants to move a community out of the town Rockridge.  So, he brings Cleavon in to make the people leave (the people in town are racist including the line: \"The sherrif is a nig!  \"What'd he say?\"  \"He said the sherrif's a near).  Funny story, funny jokes (the farting sequence is ahead of it's time for 1974) and 2 breakthroughs- Madedline Kahn in a Oscar nominated performance as Von Shtupp and shines through.  The other is Richard Pryor, who co-writes the script with Brooks and Andrew Bergman. Hilarious, forever.  A+",

            "content": "A few years ago, Broadway producers decided to adapt a Mel Brooks comedy and made a bundle. Could it happen again with 'Blazing Saddles?' The movie already has four great songs; a half-dozen more of similar caliber would make for a strong score. 'Blazing Saddles' has a ready-made cast of over-the-top characters, strong audience identification, and some minor problems for a theatrical production (like blowing up the phony Rock Ridge) which are easily overcome.But 'The Producers' was a cult film that never made it to Main Street and needed the second act of a Broadway musical to give it a place in popular culture. 'Blazing Saddles' could never open again as big as it did in 1974. In the summer of Watergate and Patty Hearst, here was one bit of madness people could enjoy. And it wasn't just random kookiness, but a film that broke barriers and courted controversy like no other major-release film of its time. No other movie had characters that were basically likable if stupid throwing around the 'N' word before. In fact, it hasn't happened since (and I doubt it would on Broadway today.) The whole notion of white people and black people living together was not new, but the approach of 'Blazing Saddles' was certainly new. In order to live together, we have to laugh together first. The only way this film was not a trailblazer was in that it blazed trails untaken by any film that came after.Was Cleavon Little then a civil rights pioneer for the 1970s, in a way Martin Luther King and Malcolm X were the decade before? He's very good, bringing a lightness to the role that's equal parts Shaft and Bugs Bunny. Richard Pryor was one of the film's writers and Brooks' first choice for Sheriff Bart, but Pryor wouldn't have played the role in the same smooth way. Little is an amiable actor, one step ahead but never cocky about it. He makes for a sympathetic center, and he is flash in those corduroy threads.Little didn't work much after 'Blazing Saddles,' which makes no sense. It was only the highest-grossing Western of all time, and Little was the lead actor in it. Maybe institutional racism wasn't the sole cause. After all, he had a distractingly rock-solid cast around him, particularly Harvey Korman as Attorney General Hedley Lamarr. Growing up in the '70s, it was a shock the first time I saw the unedited 'Blazing Saddles' with all the casual vulgarity spewing from the mouth of Tim Conway's slapstick buddy on the ultra G-rated 'Carol Burnett Show.' 'You will be only risking your lives, whilst I will be risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor,' he tells his gang before they ride off to pillage Rock Ridge. If only the Academy didn't penalize comedies so, that might have been true.Madeline Kahn did get nominated for Lili Von Shtupp, and deserved her Laurel and Hardy handshake for sure. Her Baba Wawa meets Marlene Dietrich performance is a comic masterpiece, and it takes guts to wear that dead-weed lingerie in which she performs 'I'm So Tired.' Slim Pickens (Taggart), Burton Gilliam (Lyle), Dom DeLuise (Buddy), and Brooks himself as 'the Gov' all shine, and the level of comic acting remains high all the way to the smallest roles, like the guy playing Hitler ('They lose me right after the bunker scene') and the cowboy who chews gum in line ('I didn't know there was gonna be so many people!')Gene Wilder is a little young and ironic for the bitter ex-gunslinger known as the Waco Kid, but he grows into the role well enough. Certainly he was in tune with what Brooks was doing more than Gig Young or Dan Dailey would have been (Brooks' earlier choices for the part, with Young making it all the way to the first day's shooting before it was discovered he wasn't just acting the part of a hopeless drunk.)'Blazing Saddles' doesn't make the IMDb top 250, but it's still one of the most significant video titles because it rewards repeat viewings so well. The wholeness of the film's comic spectacle is too dense to be absorbed in one viewing, especially when you are laughing too hard. It's a cultural landmark, yes, but it's even funnier now than it was 30 years ago, one of the funniest comedies that exist today. Making it into a musical now would almost be demeaning, but I suspect it will happen anyway.",

            "content": "Remember the days when humanity could laugh at itself? Blazing Saddles is a film that takes us all back to a more innocent era. An era where PC was just a couple of letters stuck together. I'll get this out of the way first: To all of you pc commies out there... the racism in this film is there to MAKE THE WHITE PEOPLE THE BUTT OF THE JOKES!!!! There is not a single person of color in this film who plays a negative character. The rednecks are what this film is really making fun of. I think most people realize this (hence the 7.7), but there are still a few who don't.This is such a funny film. From the opening scene along the railroad tracks to the shot of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little riding off into the sunset in a limo, the film provides an endless stream of laughs. Every time a person views this film, they can notice something truly hilarious that they may have missed the last time. Mel Brooks doesn't always hit the mark with his comedy, but this film was by far his best effort.Cleavon Little and Harvey Korman give the best performances in my opinion. I think Cleavon Little stole every scene in every film I saw him in. He died way too young, and I wish he could have acted in more films. Korman's Hedley Lamar character is a real hoot. By the end of my most stressful days at work, I often find myself talking to everyone in his voice. So evil, and so calculating! He and Slim Pickens played off each other flawlessly.Good luck catching an un-edited version of this classic anywhere but on the DVD. Forget about any kind of an effective remake, either. Not in this day and age.Don't miss this film! 10 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.",

The thing that really works is all the in jokes laced throughout the film.  This shows that the cast and crew were really having fun in writing and producing this film.  But the main credit should go to the late Cleavon Little.  He was perfect as Bart.  He took the role when many thought it should have gone to Richard Pryor (who was a co-writer on the film).  However, I think Pryor might have been a little too over the top for the role.  Little played it more low key and not as militant as Pryor might have.Also, this film was rated R when it was first released back in 1974.  Today it probably would get either a P.G. or, at most, a P.G.-13 rating.",

            "content": "Mel Brooks found a way in 1974 to direct two of the greatest comedies of all time. And in that one year, he found a way to cram as many movie parodies, and not have any overlap, as any director can in Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. What Young Frankenstein was to the 1930s horror movies Blazing Saddles was to the Westerns of the 1960s. And add in there the oppression of blacks during the same time, and you have a biting satire on the role of blacks in society, if not in 1974, at least the way it was in 1874. Cleavon Little (by the way, he's black) plays Bart, a slave laborer for Hedley Lamarr's (Harvey Korman in a GREAT performance as a scheming government employee) railroad who needs to cut through the town of Rock Ridge for completion. The townspeople won't sell their land, so Lamarr has the sheriff killed and replaced with Bart. He's not really welcomed into the town, but with help from Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) he is able to earn's the town's trust. Standard plot, and a plot that does not really matter. The humor is so scatological, from so many periods of time, that we know it's a movie, and the characters in the movie know they are in a movie. Take Slim Pickens when he cries out \"What in the wide world of sports is going on here?\" And the final 10 minutes of the movie is just odd in any other movie, but somehow works in Blazing Saddles. So much humor is cut out of the TV versions, so don't waste your time with it. It has to be seen with the language and \"sexually suggestive\" scenes to be fully appreciated.",

            "content": "In its side-splitting takedown of racism and all-purpose ignorance, 1974's \"Blazing Saddles\" is one of the boldest and most important satires ever made. As raunchy and as ludicrous as it is whip-smart, it can claim parentage of modern-day parodies from \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999)\" to \"Sausage Party (2016)\" to music industry spoof \"Stadium Anthems (2018)\" in their uses of obscenity, intelligence, and song to expose inane social truths.It's the Wild West. Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) is a white business opportunist with moronic and hyper-sexed governor William J. LePetomane (Mel Brooks) in his back pocket. Lamarr wants to build a railroad through the outpost town of Rock Ridge. When he can't scare off the town folk, he incites chaos by saddling them with a black sheriff (Bart, played by the now-iconic Cleavon Little), who just days before was a railroad laborer sentenced to hanging. It turns out that the sly Bart is a rare sage in a frontier littered with dumb white people; he pairs with booze-soaked gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder) to rally the town against Lamarr's thugs.Wearing no seatbelt, \"Blazing Saddles\" rebukes the absurdity of racism with its own absurdist countermeasures. While its blueprint would never make it past present-day studio tastemakers, its defrocking of ignorance has never been better primed for mass consumption. This is a watershed comedy that presides atop any short list of film's greatest satires. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking \"Helpful.\" Cheers!)",

            "content": "Mel Brooks made several very popular and memorable films in the '70s but I doubt any was more popular than this one. Made just several years after the morals' code had been lifted in Hollywood, it was able to provide humor in a new and shocking way. People could fart, swear, have old ladies use the n- word, men could punch horses in the face, make fun of any religion, creed, race or whatever was there to make fun of ...in other words, no holds barred when it came to trying to get a laugh. Nothing was sacred at this time in Hollywood history and few capitalized on this as well as Brooks, especially with this film.The film doesn't have much shock value anymore but it's still fun to watch and probably always will be, thanks to the outrageous characterizations in here.On the negative side, especially if don't know Brooks does whatever he can to get a laugh and isn't all that political, this film might be too politically-correct with its reverse racism, bias against religion and overly crude situations.But - a big but - there are so many funny lines in here, so many funny scenes you never forget and never fail to laugh no matter how many times you see it (the campfire scene alone has made men cry in laughter for 30 years) that you can overlook about anything in here.In summary, a true \"classic\" guaranteed to entertain for many more years to come.",

            "content": "I recently purchased Blazing Saddles on DVD, to replace my well used and abused VHS copy. I was amazed at how funny this movie still IS.Although I've never found humor in flatulence, that scene is a classic; the bad guys all sitting around the campfire, eating beans and ripping loud ones while Taggart (Slim Pickens) attempts to contrive a new scheme for ridding them of the new Sheriff of Rock Ridge. \"Well, what about Mongo?\" I always felt uncomfortable with the use of racial slurs, and this movie made me uncomfortable in that way, but it was Mel Brooks's intent to make us uncomfortable with racism. You can't correct a problem until you drag it out and lay it on the table, which is precisely what he did. He left no stone unturned, and even took a few pot shots at himself in the process.This movie should have won about a hundred awards for its edge, wit, boldness, and the wonderful performances brought to the mix by these veteran actors. While Madeline Kahn did win a nomination for her portrayal as Lily von Shtupp, she should have won..and won..and won.That is my favorite scene in the entire movie.Gene Wilder is brilliant as the \"Deputy Spade.\" While he was a bit young to be cast as a washed-up gunslinger, he molds himself into the role very quickly and lends a strong endearing presence to his character. Endearing is a good word. It fits Clevon Little's character, as well. He was honorable, clever, and completely smooth as the Sheriff of Rock Ridge. I highly admired his performance, and still do.The dark humor in this movie is astounding. Brooks leaves no ethnic group unscathed by his cutting wit. There is no wonder this is the top grossing western attempt to be put on film. In the 1970's, when this was first released, America needed this form of release. There were serious racial tensions throughout the country, Watergate was still ringing in our ears, and the drama that was Patty Hurst's life for a time was still very much front page news. We, as a nation, needed a diversion which was not afraid of controversy and harsh reviews. The box office gross demonstrated just how much we DID need this movie, at the time it came out.For that; being there for us when we needed it most, many thousands, if not millions, are loyal to Brooks and his productions, regardless of the subject matter. The laughter and lightheartedness he gave to us lives on. I was so pleased to see this movie redistributed on DVD.Now, another generation can see and enjoy it as much as we did. Though they may not understand how we could laugh at a bunch of idiotic rednecks singing slave songs, using the \"N\" word every other line, and comparing anyone with any level of culture to \"a bunch of Kansas City fagots,\" hopefully, the humor will not be lost to the misunderstanding that these slurs were meant to be taken seriously. The intent was to LAUGH AT those ignorant rednecks for BEING ignorant rednecks.Long live Mel Brooks, the Crowned Prince of Parody!! It rates a 9.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",

            "content": "I have a great deal of difficulty in deciding whether Blazing Saddles or The Producers is the funnier of the Mel Brooks comedies. Being a western aficionado I suppose I have to go with this film. I don't think there was a western clich\u00e9 Mr. Brooks missed in this one. From the first scene with that celebrated foof contest going on at the campfire to that last shootout at the premier of Blazing Saddles, you'd better be ready to not stop laughing for one minute. Mel Brooks assembled one of the best casts of comic actors this side of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and got lifetime performances out of all of them.I've always thought that Mel Brooks for Blazing Saddles borrowed a lot from the surreal quality of the Road pictures and certainly Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder have a Crosby/Hope like camaraderie going.My favorite though is Harvey Korman as chief villain Hedy, oops I mean Hedley Lamarr. That was the role of a lifetime for him, I think his best moment on screen. Following closely is Madeline Kahn as famous saloon entertainer Lily Von Shtupp. You could tell the Code was a thing of the past when a character could have a name like that. John Wayne was purportedly shown the script and while he declined to be in it, he did say it was the funniest thing he ever read and he would buy the first ticket.Now that's the highest possible endorsement pilgrim.",

Realizing that he stands to make a fortune if he can acquire the rights to this town the corrupt attorney general by the name of \"Headley Lamarr\" (Harvey Corman) decides to send in some ruthless cowboys to chase all of the town's residents out. However, much to his chagrin, rather than leaving, the townspeople decide to hire a sheriff to defend their interests instead. That being said, upon learning of the townspeople's plan, he subsequently manipulates \"Governor Lepetomane\" (Mel Brooks) into hiring a black man named \"Bart\" (Cleavon Little) to the position figuring that they won't tolerate someone who isn't white. What he doesn't count on, however, is just how clever and resourceful Sheriff Bart becomes once he actually pins on his badge. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a good comedy which benefited from several fine performances with Madeline Kahn (as \"Lili Von Shtupp\") probably standing out the most. I also liked Robyn Hilton (as the governor's secretary \"Miss Stein\") for a completely different reason. On the flip side, however, I must admit that a good part of the humor was rather crude and some viewers might take great offense at some of the off-color jokes and stereotypes. Be that as it may, although this film definitely had its faults, I still found it to be quite humorous and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

            "content": "1974 was a very good year for the team of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder; their \"Young Frankenstein\" (which came out in 1974) is one of the funniest movies ever made, and \"Blazing Saddles\" (same year) is almost just behind it. It's a bit overrated (but just a bit); I know a lot of people look on this as the funniest movie of all time, but I can't go THAT far. But it is ONE of the funniest movies of all time, and for two such movies by the same director, with the same star, to come out the same year, to be on that list is quite an achievement.The residents of Rock Ridge (all named Johnson) need a new sheriff. They get one... Bart, played by Cleavon Little, who happens to be black. It's all planned out by Hedley Lamarr (don't call him Heddy!), an employee of the governor (Mel Brooks), in a plot to run the residents out of town so he can have a railroad run through it. At first, the townsfolk aren't happy about this development, but when Bart endeavors to save them from the evil Lamarr, who's played to slimy perfection by Harvey Korman, they warm up to him. Also thrown into the mix is Wilder as \"The Waco Kid\", a gunslinger who's lost his knack for shooting, Alex Karras as a huge idiot named Mongo , and Madeline Khan as Lily von Schtupp, a parody of Marlene Dietrich, complete with ridiculous German accent. She stands out heads and shoulders above everybody else in this movie, I think, and her song \"I'm Tired\" (\"I'm not a wabbit! I need some west!\") is possibly the funniest song ever to appear in a film. This is no doubt the funniest part Madeline Khan has ever had (and she ALSO appeared in \"Young Frankenstein\"!). It's also a kick to see a pre-\"Magnum PI\" John Hillerman as Howard Johnson, with an ice cream shop with a sign that screams \"1 Flavor\"; and Slim Pickens (Taggart, another bad guy) is always a hoot.The plot is just an excuse to make fun of westerns, racism, and movie-making in general, as demonstrated in the extremely wacky, fourth-wall breaking finale (Watch for Dom DeLuise in these scenes). None of this is really supposed to make sense or be realistic, it's just supposed to be funny, and for the most part it is. It's one of the crassest and crudest mainstream movies in history, and that's it's strength; it often plays just like a Mad movie parody. One example of this that really sticks out is the famous farting scene, which somehow manages to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie, and probably the funniest fart scene ever. But the focus is on the way blacks were treated in the post-Civil War old west, and the movie is merciless in the way it has its ignorant white characters treat the black characters, throwing the n-word around without abandon and giving them the dirty work (at one point, a character says \"We can't afford to lose any horses! Send a couple of n****rs!\"). The movie finds its heart in the way the initially racist townspeople of Rock Ridge become fond of their black sheriff.Its spirit, however, is in the hilarious and crude jokes that are thrown all through. This is one funny movie, and with Mel Brooks, that's what's really important.",

It is as potent decades later as it was in the turbulent 1970's, giving the world something to laugh at as the U.S. at least tried to wrap up a terrible war in Vietnam and political intrigue in its government. If laughter is the best medicine, then Brooks and Pryor gave us an overdose of it, and if laughing can kill, what a better way to go? Equally going after every minority, Brooks and Pryor do not pull a \"French Mistake\". The film has so many classic moments that you can't even pinpoint the five funniest easily. Just stay away from the beans.Rock Ridge, a small western town (where pretty much everybody, including the ice cream owner, has the last name of Johnson) is undergoing corruption through governor Brooks, nefarious power hungry town boss Harvey Korman (who will do anything to get a railroad through the territory), his henchman Slim Pickens and the seductive chanteuse Madeline Kahn. \"Holy underwear!\" Brooks exclaims, giving the audience a hint of the type of humor to come, and indeed, it had already started with the presence of the mistreated railroad worker Cleavon Little who ends up being made sheriff as part of a scheme by Korman to further control the town. Once Kahn samples a taste of how Little's people are gifted (and it ain't little....). Gene Wilder takes on the smaller role of Little's sidekick, a former bandit himself, but makes the most of an inconsequential part.With what could have been an extended sketch a la \"The Carol Burnett Show\" ends up being a 90 minute series of gags that is a combination of corniness, cleverless and baudiness. Korman, as \"Hedley Lamarr\", gets a good bulk of the laughs, even with just his name, but it is Little's charming performance that provides the film with its intelligence. It is obvious that Pryor immediately got the scope of Brooks' intentions, and through little hints shows the audience the absurdity of racism. Pryor (obviously with Brook's aide) parodies many popular films, including (obviously) \"Destry Rides Again\", with hints of \"Tower of London\" (the hangman speaks like Boris Karloff) and \"Stagecoach\" thrown in.The whole cast is uniformly very funny with Kahn delivering a delightful Dietrich impression singing \"I'm Tired\", Devine emulating all of the classic western bullies, and Korman very funny as the main villain. Alex Karras is completely unrecognizable as the idiotic Mongo, best remembered for slugging a horse while its owner is still on it, and the Jessamine Milner as the seemingly sweet old lady who makes a hysterical use of a vicious slur. The parody takes on new meaning when it ends up moving from the western town set to the backlot, interrupting a lavish musical number sequence being filmed by Dom DeLuise. 90 minutes of absurdity so brilliantly handled that you can't help but come out of it with a sore gutt from laughing. My only complaint? That this could have easily been two hours, and I still would have wanted more!",

In this respect,\"Blazing Saddles\" is worth a dozen solemn Stanley Kramer - type epics. From the great Count Basie orchestra to the chain gang singing a close harmony version of \"I get a kick out of you\", Brooks does no finger - wagging but merely puts the conventions of race and the Western to the sword. With a writing assist from the late Richard Prior - who made Eddie Murphy look like Pippi Longstocking - Mr Brooks hilariously deconstructs a few sacred cows that Hollywood had baulked at for years and has never had the balls to put under the microscope since. Making the most of the artistic freedom he was allowed 36 years ago he gleefully attacked stereotypes of every hue.Today the studio would pull the plug after the first day's rushes.I guess liberalism and freedom of expression don't go together quite as neatly as we might have been led to believe.

The sublime Mr Harvey Korman walks away with the movie as the would - be suave villain,with Miss Madeleine Kahn pushing him very close as the Saloon chanteuse Lilli von Schtupp. Will we ever see another comedy like it?I fear not. Unless some hot young writer decides to pen a script about a child - abusing Muslim survivalist who has written a musical about Al Quaeda and wants it produced on Broadway.",

This comedy classic was made in 1974 and was directed by the once great Mel Brooks. I say once because he really went into decline after spaceballs (which was just o.k). This movie was written by Andrew Bergman who also wrote one of my other favorite comedies \"The Freshman\". This is another one of those movies I hope they never remake, it just works so why mess with things that work and yes work so well.

My favourite being Harvey Korman who is absolutely hilarious as chief antagonist Hedley Lamarr. Director Mel Brooks also has a number of cameos, the funniest being the Jewish Indian chief.Some moments may struggle to resonate with a modern day audience. There are some quite bawdy sequences with women being objectified for the sake of ridiculing the male characters and also some scenes that could be interpreted as homophobic.

Whoever they are I am sure that they are missing a funny bone because Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies I have seen in my life. There is no way you could make this kind of movie today and get away with it because too many people out there don't have a sense of humor about racism even when it comes to a movie that is poking fun at it.On a side note I am a tad disappointed that Richard Pryor wasn't able to play Black Bart but he was still able to write some jokes in and work on the movie.A wonderful western classic.

It's packed with one-liners, sight gags, numerous anachronisms, delicious performances in virtually every role, and some absolutely brilliant exercises in the breaking of the fourth wall. Gorgeously shot in Panavision by Joseph F. Biroc and wonderfully scored by John Morris - there's also some catchy ditties with lyrics by Brooks - \"Blazing Saddles\" is fun from start to finish, and remains a very quotable movie 40 years later.Villainous attorney Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to get rid of the town of Ridge Rock to make way for a railroad line and does his best to ensure that the townspeople are unhappy. One of his methods is hiring a black sheriff named Bart (the engaging Cleavon Little), and of course the \"good\" people of Ridge Rock don't take kindly to this. But Bart vows to make a go of things, and makes a friend in washed-up gunfighter Jim (ever likable Gene Wilder); eventually he starts gaining supporters as he comes up with ways to combat Lamarr and his goons.This whole cast is a delight, and it reads like a who's who of talent: Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn (doing a priceless Marlene Dietrich parody), Brooks himself as the governor, Burton Gilliam, Alex Karras, David Huddleston, Liam Dunn, John Hillerman, George Furth, Jack Starrett (hilarious as the incoherent Gabby Johnson), Carol Arthur, Charles McGregor, and Dom DeLuise.It's no surprise that AFI would name this as one of cinemas' best comedies. It has a very high quotient of successful verbal and visual jokes, enough to sustain it for a lively and irresistible hour and a half. That scene where a gang of cowboys enjoy a dinner of baked beans and the obvious result is still quite funny. Best of all is that ingenious finale.Modern movie lovers who tire of the kind of spoofs being cranked out nowadays are advised to see this gem, an example of how to do this kind of thing right.Nine out of 10.",

Seeing as it is a spoof, the plot really doesn't matter too much since the entire genre is basically an excuse to poke fun at other things. And, I must say, BLAZING SADDLES does this quite well. Parts of it are kind of corny, and the middle 20-30 minutes is a bit dry, but the way it sends up the Western and makes fun of racial stereotypes more than compensates for whatever weaknesses it has. My favorite parts were Madeline Kahn as a Marlene Dietrich parody, Lili Von Shtupp, and Harvey Korman as the verbose Hedley Lamarr. Those were probably the most substantial running gags and they never got old. The opening and closing sequences (which goes more meta than I've never seen pre-90's) were also quite good.

All that I saw here were a few charismatic performances and the occasional scene that made me chuckle. For me at least, this film stands as proof that absurdity does not necessarily create huge laughter.  There was a tremendous waste of talent in this movie, and that makes it all the more annoying.  In particular, Cleavon Little stands out as an actor who did a great job but had little material to work with.  This is one of the most disappointing films that I have ever seen.",

            "content": "I'm surprised at how many liberties Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor took when they wrote the screenplay; because in 2018 you wouldn't expect a comedy from the 70s to be so daring and courageous, not to mention hilarious!\nA questionable politician (Harvey Korman) wants to get his hands on the land of a quiet Western town, because such town is in the way of a railroad being constructed. The town is left without a sheriff, so they demand that the Governor sends a new sheriff to guard the town. This crooked politician, Hedley Lamarr manages to convince the Governor (Mel Brooks) to send a black man for the job, a man who was just about to be executed for hitting a white man with a shovel. This newly appointed sheriff, Bart (Cleavon Little) gets a cold welcome from the town folks for obvious reasons but he manages to find a friend in local drunk, and former notorious gunman Jim AKA \"the Waco Kid\" (played by the amazing Gene Wilder). Their chemistry is untouchable and undeniable. Black leading man, and side kick white man, if done right, it's a marvellous recipe for comedy. And Mel Brooks did more than well, he gave us an unforgettable classic, full of great scenes, cool lines and funny jokes.The farting scene, never done before; the whole sequence of Lili von Shtupp and Bart; when Bart arrives in town and exits the scene by holding a gun to his own head taking himself as \"hostage\"; the Waco Kid shooting all the guns of Lamarr's henchmen; and one of my favorite scenes of the film: when the huge battle takes place and everybody ends up crashing into a Hollywood musical set. And there's even more quality scenes to be named, that's how you know a comedy is great!One of the things that fascinates me the most about Blazing Saddles is its self-awareness. Everyone is aware that this is a spoof, but still manage to make it believable at some points, and even the exaggerated bits can't help but to make one laugh, mainly because they are well done. And if you are watching it for the first time some things may caught you off guard and still leave you laughing. Another thing that I absolutely LOVED about this movie is when the fourth wall is decidedly torn apart, ripped to pieces; when Hedley Lamarr goes to the cinema to watch the very same movie he is in, I just lost it! Comedic genius! Hedley Lamarr is one of my favorite characters from the movie, and Harvey Korman gave an exceptionally funny performance still lingering to this day, which is a testament of how amazing this film really is.I would also like to point out Cleavon Little's performance, he never over did it, he played his character in such a cool fashion, he had great funny lines, and he proved to be a great casting choice. I read somewhere that Richard Pryor was set to play Bart, but who knows, he probably would have been a little bit over the top in my opinion.So basically, if you want laughs, this is your movie!",

            "content": "For all of it's great and funny sight and sound gags, I can't help feeling that \"Blazing Saddles\" was brought down a considerable number of notches with it's deplorably vulgar treatment of serious subjects like rape and murder. I don't get why Mel Brooks would sink so low in an attempt to get a laugh, when subjects like those are hardly a laughing matter. I had a similar reaction to a line in Alfred Hitchcock's 1972 film \"Frenzy\", when a bar patron suggests rape as a 'silver lining' compared to the murder that follows. Brooks showed that he could direct great comedy without resorting to the 'lowest common denominator' style of making pictures with \"Young Frankenstein\", which came out the same year. That was funny without being offensive.With that out of the way, there are some genuinely fine and funny moments in \"Blazing Saddles\". I particularly get a kick out of those fleeting scenes that suggest a surreal and manic look at the world, like hangman Boris with a noose around a horse's neck, or a business sign heralding Howard Johnson's one flavor of ice cream. Depending on my disposition, the campfire scene even gets an occasional chuckle out of me, juvenile as that might seem.What probably works best for this picture is it's way of deconstructing the entire issue of political correctness, poking fun at a white red-neck brand of racism and contrasting it with a black pride and sense of dignity for the workers on the railroad. The notion of setting up a black man to fail backfiring was a brilliant concept to explore, so that by the end of the story, the whole 'why can't we all just get along' agenda is put in it's proper perspective.As Mad Magazine would put it, the usual gang of idiots is here in fine form - Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Dom DeLuise and Madeline Kahn looking better than ever as the Teutonic Titwillow. Cleavon Little as Sheriff Bart is at the center of the madness, providing the anchor to keep the story moving to it's inevitable conclusion. The proverbial ride into the sunset is given new meaning here in keeping with the character of the picture and Brooks' own brand of insanity.",

It's not a great piece of filmmaking by any stretch of the imagination, but I have always got a lot of pleasure out of it. I guess I have to admit to being a bit of a fan of the work of Mel Brooks, he has a pretty unique way of looking at things. His take on the Western is a prime example\u0085 lots of jokes about race and class but never in bad taste.When politically connected bad man Hedley Lemar hears the railroad is to go through the small town of Red Rock he decides he wants the land for himself. In his words, \"It will be worth millions!\". When the townsfolk petition the governor to give them a new Sheriff, Hedley forges a plot to make the townsfolk leave by giving them a new Sheriff of his choosing, a new black Sheriff. He has chosen a troublemaker called Bart to fill the post and he is keen to impress the townsfolk. Things don't go according to plan and Bart is left in the Sheriff's office with his deputy, a drunk called Jim. Now Jim is a former gunfighter called the Wako Kid, but those days are behind him now. Can Bart get the townsfolk on his side? Will Jim stop drinking and take up his guns again? Why does everyone in town seem to have the surname Johnson? All these and many more questions are answered in the film 'Blazing Saddles'.What I like about this film is the fact that Brooks doesn't restrict himself to spoofing Westerns. No genre is safe, there are lots of references to the Nazi's for instance. Good performances all round; Cleavon Little as Bart, Gene Wilder as Jim, Slim Pickens as Taggart, Harvey Korman as Hedley Lemar, Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp and, of course, Mel Brooks as Governor William J. Lepetomane / Indian Chief.The ending of the film is a bit of a mess with a fight in the town spilling over into other sets on the film studio. I can forgive that though because this film has given me and my friends so many quotes over the years. It's not only the spoken gags though, it's the visual ones as well. The scene where a man and his horse are about to be hung I find hilarious. As a piece of filmmaking, it's a bit of a mess, it all seems to have been a bit rushed, but I love it!\u0085 Recommended.My Score: 7.8/10",

But he can make quite the awful film when he wants to. Remember the Hitchcock parody, High Anxiety? That sucked big time, but I liked Blazing Saddles even less. I giggled a couple of times, but there was only one big laugh. Most of the funnier jokes were ruined by a 60 seconds long promo I saw on Comedy Central! Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, and Slim Pickens try their damndest to make it work, but they have no material to work with whatsoever. Some of the racial comedy might have worked back when Richard Pryor first started his career, but it's all hopelessly dated in 2002. And is it just me, or do others cringe whenever Madeline Kahn shows up in a Mel Brooks movie? I guess I laugh at her in Young Frankenstein, but she does little but embarrass the production when she comes on screen. 4/10.",

            "content": "\"The Producers\" director Mel Brooks took the traditional white Hollywood western down an entirely different trail with this audacious 93-minute slapstick horse opera. \"Blazing Saddles\" stands every convention and clich\u00e9 in the corral on their respective heads and then gives the genre a boot in the butt. Were you to start watching this western satire and not realize that it was a crude, rude, lowbrow comedy with lots of one-liners, vaudeville routines, campy shticks, sight gags, dopey imitations and comic anachronisms, you might either be appalled or outraged by the intolerance toward African-Americans, minorities in general, and homosexuality. Indeed, when \"Blazing Saddles\" came out in 1974, during the heyday of blaxploitation cinema--you know \"Shaft\" and \"Super Fly\"--use of the derogatory epithet N-word still wasn't considered as politically insensitive as in our current multi-cultural society. Moreover, the epithet \"faggot\" was used, too. Brooks has said that his lowest common denominator western spoof \"truly broke ground, and it broke wind.\" Mind you, the administrative suits at the studios cringed at the racial degradations as well as the wind-breaking campfire scene where cowboy consume copious quantities of baked beans and break wind. One studio executive wanted Brooks to eliminate this scene and the scene where Alex Karras knocks the horse down, but Brooks refused. Initially, even Brooks had some misgivings about the campfire scene and approach studio executive John Calley who advised him to 'ring the bell.' The campfire scene didn't alienate audiences, and \"Blazing Saddles\" emerged as one of the top cinematic box office hits of 1974. Basically, a quintet of scribes, including Brooks and future comic superstar Richard Pryor, appropriate the empire building plot about the evil railroad out to destroy a town in its way. The railroad runs into quicksand and their nefarious boss Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman of \"The April Fools\") decides to destroy the town of Rock Ridge to obtain the right-of-way without paying a dime. Hedley dreams up a surefire scheme, \"If I could find a sheriff who so offends the citizens of Rock Ridge that his very appearance would drive them out of town.\" He persuades the incredulous Governor William J. Lepetomane (Mel Brooks) to appoint an African-American railroad laborer Bart (Cleavon Little of \"Vanishing Point\") as an all white town's new sheriff. Brooks and company couldn't have made this oater at a better time!One of the railway laborers, Bart, gets into trouble when Taggart (Slim Pickens of \"Dr. Strangelove\") dispatches him and a friend to take a hand car down the line to investigate the presence of quicksand. Indeed, the rails have been laid in quicksand because Bart and his friend sink into the stuff. The railroad foreman pulls the hand car out of the quicksand and leaves Bart and his buddy to die. Bart climbs out of the quagmire and wraps a shovel around Taggart's head. This insolence lands Bart in jail with a date for the executioner, until Hedley decides that he has a better use for him. Indeed, Hedley realizes that he is breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience when he comes up with his scheme. \"Why am I asking you?\" He turns away from the camera and heads off to see Governor Lepetomane. As upset as Lepetomane is about Bart becoming the new sheriff of Rock Ridge, Hedley spins the situation so that it appeals to the governor. \"Yes,\" he assures Lepetomane about the egalitarian message it will send to one and all about his liberality, \"the first man ever to appoint a black sheriff.\" Of course, Lepetomane believes that he can only reap the worst of a bad situation. Hedley struggles to convince him that Lepetomane will win a place in history alongside Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln with his appointment of Bart as the Rock Ridge lawman. A pimped out looking Bart in a leather suit rides a horse with Gucci saddle bags. He rides by Count Basie and his orchestra on the plains as he heads to Rock Ridge. Meanwhile, the dutiful citizens of Rock Ridge have prepared a reception for the arrival of their new sheriff. No, they do not know that he is black. Gabby Johnson (Jack Starrett of \"Kid Blue\"), a send-up of perennial western character actor Gabby Hayes, spots Bart riding into town and tries to warn his fellow citizens that Bart is an African-American. A bell cuts Gabby off every time that he says the N-word, and everybody believes Gabby is saying, \"The sheriff is near.\" The townspeople are appalled when they see Bart. Bart ascends the platform and states, \"By the power invested in me by the honorable William J. Lepetomane, I hereby assume the duties of the office of sheriff in and for the township of Rock Ridge.\" Not surprisingly, everybody pulls a gun on Bart and Bart imitates them by pulling his own gun on himself. The whites put down this revolvers and Bart admires his talent. Later, at a town meeting, the citizens complain about Bart. Harriett Johnson (Carol Arthur of \"Making It\") sums up the sentiments of everybody, \"The white, God-fearing citizens of Rock Ridge wish to express our extreme displeasure with your choice of sheriff. Please remove him immediately!\" Indeed, the only friend that Bart has in Rock Ridge is a prisoner hanging upside down his jail cell. Jim (Gene Wilder of \"Bonnie and Clyde\") surprises Bart when he identifies himself as 'the Waco Kid.' \"He had the fastest hands in the west,\" an incredulous Bart observes. Jim adds, \". . . the world.\" One day a six-year kid shot Jim in the butt and Jim turned into an alcoholic. Brooks directs \"Blazing Saddles\" like a situation comedy. The biggest surprise occurs near the end when a fleeing Hedley winds up on the set of a movie musical with queer guys galore struggling to perform a dance number. Alex Karras is hilarious as Mungo, a thug who knocks a horse down with his fist.",

The surprising beginner Sheriff named Bart (Cleavon Little) join forces with Jim (Gene Wilder) to foil the railroad-building plan of the villainous Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) who is helped by Mongo (Alex Karras) and Lili (Madeline Kahn ).It's an entertaining story and very amusing tale with the Farceur Mel Brooks-his first hit film- as director and secondary acting .

In other words, just because Mel Brooks can be very funny does NOT mean he knows everything about movies nor should he write, direct and act in them (the Jerry Lewis Syndrome). Most of his movies in recent years have amply proved this (Robin Hood Men in Tights as well as Life Stinks come to mind).I picked Blazing Saddles to review because, in my opinion, it sparked the beginning of the end of his brilliance. The beginning of his unchecked excesses became so apparent here and only got worse in his following efforts. Unlike The Producers (where he is in the movie for a VERY brief instant during the Springtime for Hitler scene), he is on screen through much of the movie and he is about is as subtle as a brick upside the head. Sure, comedy can be this unsubtle, but I feel that the quality of his movies is inversely related to how much time he seen on screen. Take High Anxiety and Life Stinks for example--both feature him as the lead actor and they are terribly unfunny flicks.So back to Blazing Saddles. The movie has MANY brilliant bits throughout (such as those with Mongo or with the town's reactions to the new sheriff) but also has such infantile segments as the \"eating beans around the campfire\" segment as well as Mel's acting as he plays the Governor. ENOUGH already--get a co-director or a STRONG producer to tell him ENOUGH--STOP!!!! But instead, the movie goes from moderately funny (and very funny in parts) to a horrific mess by the end. Instead of a real ending, it degenerates to a fight scene which spills over into other pictures. Is the ending original? Maybe--but certainly not funny. And from here on, it only gets worse.So, my recommendation is watch The Producers. It's a nearly perfect comedy--too bad it was at the beginning of Brooks' film career.",

And therein lies the magic of Blazing Saddles. Little was THE actor to play Bart, a suave, urbane fellow who shines well above the hysterically funny peckerwood riff raff that surrounds him in this film.Never mind that this is probably the greatest comedy script ever penned, and that Gene Wilder, in retrospect, may be most remembered for his genius portrayal of the confused, laconic and perpetually drunk Waco Kid. Mel Brooks committed 100 percent to Little and arguably the funniest film in Hollywood history was born. And I haven't even mentioned Slim Pickens, Madeleine Kahn and Harvey Korman, each whom is nothing short of magnificent in their roles.Virtually every single line of dialogue in this film can be quote dropped at a barbecue, cocktail party or card game, and everyone laughs their butt off because they remember how funny it is.

It's just that its comedy hails from an era when nothing like it was ever seen on film or TV. It was a hit because of its difference, much like Airplane would be later.

While he's opposed with too many N words to count and plans fall through to get said rail route, the oppressed rise up and the rest is somewhat history...somewhat today.Long ago, my father wanted this movie for Christmas and I obliged with a copy. Having not seen it and one of his favorite comedies, we watched it on Christmas after all gifts were opened. I was appalled. Much like how Natural Born Killers was a movie satirizing gruesome violence and then just became the glorification of gruesome violence, Blazing Saddles satirized racism and was chock-full of it. It was so hard to listen to N fifty times, amongst other racist words and homophobia.Fast-forward probably 20 years and a friend sent me a clip of this movie involving the KKK and jokes and I actually found it hilarious. I think enough time had passed to give this another pass. Well, like I said, it took three nights to finally finish this.1st night: same impression as the first one 2 decades ago and I turned it off halfway through. 2nd night, not so much, but I got distracted and didn't finish. And tonight, I laughed super hard. EVERYONE was a target here, including myself. While the majority of the movie is hilarious, the climax had me in tears. So creative and seemingly never-ending in brave new ideas...and this movie is 46 years old! (No need to calculate, this movie came out about 5 weeks before I was born.)I loved it and if you're not super sensitive, know what era this came out of and what its real intentions were, you might enjoy it too.But, if Disney+ is your ONLY streaming platform, you might shy away from this film.***Final thoughts: NEVER been a Mel Brooks fan. Comedy, as they say, is subjective and I never really dug his. I think that's changing. More and more, I've rediscovered his films or saw them for the first time and I still laugh at my memories of them long after. I recently watched for the first time 1967's The Producers and Young Frankenstein. And loved both. I have seen Spaceballs probably a couple of decades ago, didn't care for it but now I probably will. And never saw Men in Tights, so that's going on my list as well. Thank God my tastes evolved and widened. Much better to appreciate and discover older comedies that mean so much to the masses that I either didn't get or see at all.",

In 1874, the railroad is secretly coming to a small town, Rock Ridge and evil government forces want to land speculate to make millions off the innocent townspeople and their land. The evil government forces want to destroy the town morale by sending in a black sheriff to help, but the clever sheriff rallies the townspeople and railroad workers against the outlaw army and dirty government leaders. Eventually they win the day over the land speculators, outlaws and racial prejudices of the old West. *Special Stars- Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Slim Pickens, Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Mel Brooks, Alex Karras.*Theme- Prejudging people before knowing them is prejudices and dumb.*Trivia/location/goofs- American, comedy, satire. Warner Brothers studio. Be sure to see the theatrical release of this film over the heavily censored TV version. You loose all the jokes. Richard Pryor was cast as the original lead here but lost the role due to his 'unreliability'. He was on the film writing staff. Gene Wilder was second choice casting for Waco Kid, Brooks wanted a leathery older clearly hard-drinking recognizable cowboy actor like Dan Daley. The film was shot on the (now gone) Larime Town back lot and prairie scenes at Aqual Dulce's well used 'Vasques Rocks' movie ranch (now country park). Watch for Mel Brooks to appear as many characters in this film. *Emotion- A classic Mel Brook's comedy film with excellent writing by his team and Richard Pryor. A satirical look at the classic Western movie genre in all of it's institutional glory for laughs. A low-key serious message film about the comedic examination of racism. *Based On- Myths on racism and old Western films.",

This sheriff (Cleavon Little) must happens to be a black man, which isn't going to sit well with the townspeople but with the help of The Cisco Kid (Gene Wilder) he might be able to turn them.Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES is one of the most loved comedies of the 1970's but it's easy to forget how ahead of its time the thing actually was. It's funny to think of how controversial the film once was but it's also a fresh reminder that at one time you could tell politically incorrect jokes and not have to apologize for it. I mean, can you imagine a movie like this coming out today? There are all sorts of nice laughs throughout the movie, which is basically Brooks' love story to the Westerns that he grew up watching. Once again the strongest aspect of the film are the performances from a terrific cast. This includes Wilder who is perfect as the gunfighter and Korman is also excellent in his campy role as the villain. Madeline Kahn and Brooks himself deliver as you'd expect them too. Little is good in his role but at the same time you can't help but wonder what would have happened had Richard Pryor gotten the role. The greatest thing here is the performance of Slim Pickens who brings that wonderful charm to this role, although of course this one here adds a racist and comic touch.I'm not going to sit here and say the film is flawless because it certainly isn't. With that said, it's easy to see why this was a landmark film and why it continues to gain new fans each passing year. With this type of humor being pretty much outlawed today the film has an even bigger importance.",

            "content": "'Blazing Saddles (1974)' is certainly problematic in places but I don't think it's racist - or, even, 'offensive' - despite featuring many characters who clearly fit that description. I also don't think it's the film's fault - or Brooks' - that a large portion of its audience is laughing at the wrong things (and, trust me, they are, even today). Most of the movie just about 'works' because it tries - in its own, somewhat basic way - to expose the immoral and nonsensical nature of racism by having pretty much every white character be as dumb as rocks and by doing the clich\u00e9d but, I guess, effective thing of getting them to respect - and, even, 'put aside their differences' and work together with - our hero after he saves their lives numerous times (subverting the 'white saviour' trope in the process). It also makes sure, and this is vital, that the black characters are never the butt of the joke (except for, perhaps, on one unwitting occasion). The problem is that there isn't really a joke there. Aside from the basic premise - which just about counts as satire - that the 'sweet', 'innocent', usually 'infallible' townsfolk are idiotic bigots - and, essentially, as bad as the gang that are harassing them - and that the black sheriff is easily the smartest person in the picture, there isn't really any cohesion with the comedy and it doesn't even feel as though it's particularly satirical - or, at least, that it's making good use of its underlying concept. The humour is inconsistent, straight-up silly and actually quite strange because there's some stuff that, by all rights, ought to work by, for some reason, just doesn't. I didn't laugh once. The only real saving grace for the feature is the chemistry between Little and Wilder; their extended first scene is actually quite entertaining and they're both good in their roles. It's a shame that Brooks seemed to include every joke under the sun, or those he could think of, because it ruins the both the pacing and believability of the piece. It's weird because there is a plot and it's given a fair bit of time to be set up, through rather lengthy 'bad guy exposition'. It's even kept as a through-line, no matter how crazy or 'off-brand' things get. It's just that it always comes second to the 'zany', immature and often movie-halting humour and, as such, has no real impact. If nothing matters, as the flick's logic-free finale suggests, then why should we care about any of it? The bottom line is that we (or, at least, I) don't. It's not particularly clever and, worse still, it's not even remotely funny. 4/10",

            "content": "\"Blazing Saddles\" reminds me of a French expression that can be translated as \"it was dumb, but no one ever thought of it\" as if it would take a certain genius to create an impact from very silly things. No one ever thought of making fun of Hitler, yet it inspired \"The Producers\", one of the funniest comedies ever, \"Blazing Saddles\" works on the same principle, only in a smaller proportion: no one ever thought of a Black sheriff (Cleavon Little) in a small Western town, Brooks did.As usual, Mel Brooks embraces political incorrectness with the enthusiasm of a little child, getting away with so many frank lines like \"I like rape\", \"Where's the white women\" and I won't do a drinking game with the number of times the N-word is uttered, hell, it's almost like a punctuation mark. Mel gets away with that because it betrays his profound desire to make us laugh, by any means, not wasting any frame, any minute without a gag, visual or verbal, slapstick, absurd and at some points, so blatantly racist I hesitated to qualify him as desperate for a laugh or irreverent genius. Maybe it takes some irreverent genius to be so desperate for a laugh, or maybe Mel Brooks' comical mechanisms work on a Freudian level in the way they invite our most shameful impulses to laugh at the un-laughable. I more enjoyed \"Blazing Saddles\" for the gags that satirized the Old West myth than those involving racial stereotypes, simply because they were much funnier and all the racist jokes combined together would never beat the part where Mongo (Alex Karras) punches the horse, probably one of the most defining moments of American Comedy's history. It's so unexpected, so perfect in the timing, that the joke works with the same level of perfectionism than the wall falling on Buster Keaton in \"Steamboat Willie Jr.\" and these are moments that lack in \"Blazing Saddles\": moments of comical discipline and precision. I don't mind cheap jokes, but sometimes, they tend to make us forget how the set-up is almost as important as the pay-off.Where would I classify the infamous campfire farting scene? This one reminded me of some of the best Simpsons jokes, when it starts being mildly funny, then it's annoying, but the scenes drag so long that it becomes funny again and almost hilarious. The timing is perfectly handled in the scene but the same can't be said for all the other jokes. I get it that it's funny if a Black man says he's got a Dutch grandma, or if an Indian chief speaks Yiddish, but it's only funny if the film doesn't contain other racial jokes, hell \"Blazing Saddles\" is loaded with them. I reckon that the story is about a black Sheriff and in a way, \"Blazing Saddles\" can be considered as a film dealing with racism and a landmark in political correctness, but all the political incorrectness in the world can't beat the hilarious wagon train moment, I laughed us so much I almost choked up. I appreciate political incorrectness but I hate the way its card is used as an alibi by the hardcore fans to justify why the movie is so great, as if it was impossible to love \"The Producers\" and consider \"Blazing Saddles\" inferior. I loved \"Blazing Saddles\" for its satirical aspect, for the way it extended all the limits of parody. It uses as some point a gag \u00e0 la 'Looney Tunes' with the same music, while I believe Mel Brooks owes more to Tex Avery. The Yiddish-speaking scene reminded me of the Oxford English speaking Indian in \"Big- Wheel Watha\" and the Indians attacks of \"Homesteader Droopy\" or Goofy's unforgettable \"Californy'er Bust\" These are my references in humor, and I felt that they inspired the best of \"Blazing Saddles\". Mongo uttering the famous \"Mongo, only pawn in the game of life\" is pure comical genius, not to mention the song of Lili Von Schtupp (Madeline Kahn perfect as a Marlene Dietrich or the poor) or Gene Wilder proving his shooting skills.The rest is just a bit overused but never unfunny. If I wasn't laughing, I was at least smiling. Mel Brooks signed a film that was begging for laughs and for not to be taken seriously, and it couldn't have had a better ending to illustrate the fact that it's a big joke. I used to dislike the ending, but now I feel it's one of the most surrealistic extents of the limits of meta-referential satire. But while \"Monty Python & the Holy Grail\" did it with a certain level of sophistication, Brooks doesn't embarrass himself with that, he's like a craftsman who builds a beautiful oeuvre d'art and then took a hammer and starts destroying it, and it takes some genius to have the guts to ruin the premise of a film, for jokes. And apparently, it worked since the film was the highest grossing of the year. People laughed and that's that.I like the film but I sometimes dislike the reasons for which it's loved by its fans. \"Blazing Saddles\" delivers what we expect from a comedy, but at some point, it just forgets to be a film, with a story, something that some of the best parodies did \"Naked Gun!\", \"Top Secret!\", \"Airplane!\" and how about Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein\" which is, in my opinion, his best film, precisely because he wasn't overdoing it, each joke has its time, each character a moment to shine, and the film had an atmosphere, a little something that elevated it above the comic genre. \"Young Frankenstein\" is like a delicious pie served in a beautiful plate, while \"Blazing Saddles\" is no less delicious, but is thrown at our face.That's all, folks!",

To get rid of the townspeople he has villains run wild, attacking townspeople.  Black sheriff Bart (Cleavon Little) and the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) fight back.  This was a huge hit in 1974--it was considered daring and uproariously funny.  Seen today it doesn't hold up.  The daring parts are very tame in the wake of comedies we have today and some of these jokes are pretty despearate.  Also I got more than a little tired of hearing a certain word beginning with \"n\" constantly used as a joke.  And there's virtual nonstrop swearing from the rest of the cast.  Most of the movie is pretty dull (when the jokes in this movie bomb they REALLY bomb!)  And the last 10 minutes are just dreadful (and horribly homophobic).I'm giving it a 6 for a few reasons.  Little is very good, handsome and heroic in his role.  Wilder is VERY funny as the washed up Kid.  Some of Korman's snearing and scheeming is funny.  And Madeline Kahn is absolutely hysterical doing a Marlene Dietrich impersonation as Lily von Shtupp (she's terribly underused but got a nomination for Best Supporting Actress).  Also there's a Count Basie cameo and some very good songs throughout.Still, all in all, this isn't that funny.

But it doesn't seem to matter in this case - nearly everybody loves it, I just want to air a definitely minority opinion! Second thing: I give the 1 mark for all the technicians behind the scenes simply doing their jobs and not involved in the \"artistic\" content of the film itself. Or maybe all those people like me who gritted their teeth to sit through this witless horror to the bitter end.A relentlessly crass and unfunny hour and a half, this was billed from the start as a groundbreaking and original riotous comedy Western - it took me 30 years to temporarily disable my moral firewall to anything by Mel Brooks and his cronies (caused by unfortunately watching that \"classic\" The Producers in the early '70's) to watch it and find it wasn't. Any scene in the film that appeared to be moving toward genuine humour was instantly swamped with swamp, a mental floss would be handy. To me, it's a sign of the moral emptiness and gullibility of generations of the hype-makers and hype-followers, and a pointer to the future with slime uttered by slimeballs generally masquerading as comedy nowadays. In these enlightened times it's not funny anymore if it's not utterly crude and pushing back the boundaries of acceptable good taste further than the horizon - but what on Earth for except it's easier than working or having talent. I didn't see Brooks or Monty Python or any other succeeding brave and challenging alternative comedian ever try this kind of thing on with Islam (it's safe to continuously attack Christianity though), because their careers would have probably been very short: it's easy for hypocrites to target people who won't hit back forcibly. Rape is a serious subject but so long as Brooks was never raped himself he thought it funny to rape our minds. Unlike most others I don't kid myself: many black people love this film mainly because if they're already racist it can stoke up their hatred of all white people and not just the rednecks shown here; it should be pretty obvious why it appeals to white racists. Many non-racist white people love it partly because they think it shows only racists, sexists, horse-punchers et al in a totally negative way: I got news for everyone whether they're black, white, rich, poor, straight, gay, racist, non-racist, man, woman or beast: it shows everyone and everything in a negative way but especially film itself as an art form. Kick everyone and everything for the Hell of it and it eventually produces Hell. And in the meantime Brooks laughed all the way to the bank, probably wondering just how insulting to his audience he could get without them getting it or understanding how talentless he was. It's nothing to do with being Politically Correct either: to their credit this grim effort would have probably been banned and burned in ye olde un-PC times and the director and production team jailed. It's purely a question of whether or not you can recognise a set of charlatans bombarding you with filth and gutter-humour and whether or not you like your nose rubbed into the metaphorical mire for 90 minutes. By the end of this relentless laughlessfest we are all taken down yet another notch, demeaned whether recognised as such or not. I trust all of the people who think comedy must be as or more offensive as this aren't offended by my opinions.At least Plan 9 was funny in places - even Dumb And Dumber wasn't as bad as this - that was aimed at 10 year olds after all, this was intentionally aimed at the general public and people in particular who dislike all forms of discipline. The only film ever made anywhere in the world (although Pasolini's Salo comes close) I wouldn't lift a finger to save from decomposition, but would give it a one finger salute if that unlikely day ever came.",

Unfortunately, Richard Pryor had already laid to rest the n-word's ostensible shock value in perhaps the most audacious and brilliant comedy album ever, \"That Nigger's Crazy\" (released the same year, 1974).Pryor's genius also exposes the utter lack of humor and sophistication in what is Mel Brooks' worst film. Like a grade-school child spewing newly-discovered \"bad\" words, Brooks' grandiose exercise in \"look-at-me-being-bad\" schlock arouses nothing so much as scorn.Coming after \"The Producers\" (brilliant) and before \"Young Frankenstein\" (also brilliant), \"Blazing Saddles\" is a cheap melange of adolescent minds trying to get a rise out of the grownups.Neither shocking nor ugly, it's just boring -- except for the one or two moments mentioned.

While any self-respecting filmmaker would be embarrassed by this, thankfully Brooks is not one of them! The cast has a field day, particularly Korman as Hedley \"Not Hedy\" Lamarr.",

It puts together all the elements of great comedy, message & classic comedy sequences, & music. It is the correct length, & it engages the viewer with a plot that just lets an extremely talented cast show off it's talent.Cleavon Little is the Sheriff who conquer fear & hate in his greatest role.I already knew him from television's Temperature Rising when I saw this, but believe me, the saddest thing is he could not achieve this level any other time in his career. What a waste of great talent. Gene Wilder (the Waco Kid) is great in support of Little(Black Bart), but then Wilder has a group of films he was very good in that are excellent films including Young Frankenstein.Slim Pickens to me is in his best form in this supporting cast. He is better in this than he even was in Dr Strangelove. Harvey Korman as Headley Lamar, not Heddy, is great too. The sequences he does with Slim Pickens are just classic movie scenes as they play the sequences as well as Harvey ever worked with anybody. Lets not forget top of career performances for Alex Karras (Mongo), John Hillerman (Howard Johnson), & a whole bunch of others & even a great cameo for Count Basie & his orchestra. This film is loaded with everything you can imagine. Howard Johnson was right, this is a great film to be sure. Even though some tastes might get offended by the use of some terms, & the admission of what baked campfire beans could do for most cowboys, you have to admit that this film does it with style, not crassness that would insult the intelligence of the viewer. This marks brilliant script work by the late Richard Pryor who was one of a team of writers who put together a hilarious script. Dare I say, this one is Mel Brooks best work. Never have terms like \"up yours\" , \"bullshit\" , \"let me whip this out\" ever been funnier how they are used in this movie. Put this film on your must see list.",

Physically I felt a little better when the movie was over, but it left a much bigger impression on me. i learned just how absurd comedy can be.Blazzing Saddles is regarded as the most satirically racist pictures. Set in the VERY wild west, a crooked politician has a plan to snatch an expensive piece of land from the town of Rockridge, where the railroad is about to enter. after the sheriff dies, He thinks he can drive all the townsfolk away, by advising the governor to appoint a black sheriff, which he does. the plan backfires, and the new sheriff ends up becomes a hero, when he leads the town in attempts to save the town from destruction.I don't think I need to give an introduction to director Mel Brooks, everyone knows who he is. For Blazzing Saddles he throws out some of the wackiest ideas I have ever seen in Comedy. A medieval hangman, a Yiddish speaking Sioux tribe, and a bar fight in a movie studio, are just a few of them. As offencive as it may be, Blazzing Saddles will always be one of the great American Comedies.",

            "content": "In the category of satire, no other film has been as aggressive or socially important as this one has been. Rated as one of the 10 funniest movies ever made, the screenplay and plot take every opportunity to make fun of the ignorance, past and present, of white racism in its most ridiculous context. But in addition to covering the issue of racism, the movie also brings to satirical accountability other sensitive social issues that were not only present in 1974, but that were present way in the past and far into the present. At some point in the movie, all of the sensitive hush hush social issues were somewhat abused.The targets of a scathing satirical call to rational accountability by Mel Brooks include a little of everything. \"Dock that chink a days pay for napping on the job\"; \"Can't you see that this man is a ni... !\"; \"Bah-dgesss! We don't need no stinkin' bahd-gesss!\"; \"Ready faggots! 1 and 2 and....\" and \"look girls, they've hit Bunny!\", etc. Many more social nuclear warheads were detonated in the many different scenes in this ground breaking landmark film. All of the characterizations were memorable by all of the main characters. But among them, Madeline Kahn must be mentioned as perhaps the funniest, with her quasi Marlena Deitrich and saloon stage presence rendition of \"I'm Tired\". But, as mentioned before, the main brunt of the satire was the ridiculously stupid white cowboy racial mentality, and the closed mindedness in which he lived in small town western American in the late 1800's. \"Howard Johnson is Right!\".In being taken aback and totally absorbed by the satirical tonality of this monumentally innovative story, we tend to overlook the plot and scenario where the actual premise of the movie is based. From the very beginning, we western fans knew that this was all about the western genre itself, in all of its glory, and the pride of them all, High Noon, from 1954. Even Frankie Laine in the opening musical introduction made the movie hilarious. He sang \"Blazing Saddles\" with the same gusto that he did when he sang High Noon 20 years before. Right from the very beginning, and all the way through to the end, the western genre fanatics were laughing and rolling their eyes with glee. The icon of the American Western, with all of its merciless clich\u00e9s, brought to its knees in 93 minutes.This film deserves only the highest praise on many accounts. Most notably, the courage with which it portrays the social absurdities of today, then and now. In 1974, it was outrageous; and today, it's still a classic. \"You'd do it for Randolph Scott!\".",

Soundbites from this movie are classic, and quoted even today. This is the kind of cult classic which a group of people can run from time to time, everyone reciting their favorite dialogue along with the characters. And there's a hilarious line or sight gag almost every moment. The campfire scene is one of the best-timed jokes ever put on film. The hiring of the assassins is another standout. The concert in the desert. The toll crossing. The false-front town with cardboard cutout \"townsfolk.\" The list goes on.The cast in this movie were nothing short of brilliant. Cleavon Little, as the sheriff, was not known for comedy, but demonstrates exceptional comic smarts. Others are also terrific: Gene Wilder, Madeline Khan, Harvey Korman, Andy Devine to name just a few. The film never lets down, maintaining high levels of chaos and silliness throughout.This Old West lunacy can be viewed again and again, and remains fun each time.

            "review_title": "Highly Amusing Parody",
            "content": "This was the first in Mel Brooks's successful series of film parodies in which he sent up the conventions of a number of established genres. The tone is struck right from the song `He Rode a Blazing Saddle' which accompanies the opening credits- a brilliant, slightly over-the-top pastiche of every song from every Western you've ever seen.The plot is a familiar Western staple- the one about the dedicated lawman or mysterious stranger who helps the inhabitants of a small town rid themselves of a gang of desperados- familiar from films such as `Dodge City', `High Noon', `Gunfight at the OK Corral' and even `High Plains Drifter', made only a couple of years earlier. A corrupt politician named Hedley Lamarr (invariably referred to as `Hedy Lamarr' in one of the film's running jokes) has sent a gang of outlaws to terrorise the people of Rock Ridge (who, in another extended joke, all have the surname Johnson) so that his railway company can acquire their land cheaply. The people petition the state governor, William J. Le Petomane, to send them a sheriff to protect them. Le Petomane, however, is in Lamarr's pocket and is persuaded to appoint a black man as Lamarr believes that the townsfolk will not accept a black sheriff. At first Lamarr is proved right, and Bart, the new appointee, is met with hostility and prejudice, but he soon wins the people over, and the rest of the film details his attempts to bring Lamarr and his bandits to justice.\nThe film has attracted a lot of negative comments because of its use of racial humour, particularly the frequent use of the word `nigger'. In my opinion such comments miss the point of the film. Mel Brooks might not have been interested in political correctness, or whatever the 1970s equivalent was, but he was nevertheless making a serious point about racism. By this I do not simply mean that he was attacking racism by satirising it, although that was part of his aim. I also mean that he was making the point, through humour, that the Old West was a deeply racist society and that many traditional Westerns had unconsciously echoed one of its racist assumptions, namely that America's manifest destiny was to make the continent safe for settlement by white people of European descent, primarily Anglo-Saxons. There had been a few films made from a viewpoint sympathetic to the American Indians (`Broken Arrow' is perhaps the best example), but these were the exception rather than the rule. As for black and Chinese inhabitants of the West (and there were plenty of both), they were largely omitted altogether. (I am talking about what was still the position in the 1970s; things have changed somewhat since).Apart from the fact that it is played for laughs rather than seriously, the presence of a black man is the one thing that distinguishes the film from a traditional Western. Brooks shows the townspeople reacting to Bart in precisely the way in which many whites in the Old West did react to blacks. (This is hardly surprising given that many of them were by origin Southerners who only a few years earlier had been fighting to preserve slavery).Despite its serious overtones, however, the film is best remembered for its humour, which largely arises from its parodying of the standard Western themes and situations. There are a number of excellent performances- from the wisecracking Cleavon Little, who plays Bart as a mixture of Wyatt Earp and Shaft, from Harvey Korman as the camp and exaggeratedly odious Lamarr, from Brooks himself as Le Petomane (the archetype of every bumbling politician who doesn't seem to know what day it is), from Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid, a broken-down alcoholic gunfighter and from Madeline Kahn as Lili von Shtupp, a German prostitute who seems to be modelled on Marlene Dietrich's role in `Destry Rides Again', right down to her Berlin accent. (Lili is supposed to be Bavarian, but the guttural `r' sound she uses is not characteristic of Bavarian German).The one thing I did not like about the film was the ending, which might have been post-modern irony (if such a thing existed in the seventies) but was more likely a way of avoiding thinking about how to bring the film to a worthy conclusion. That apart, however, I found this a highly amusing film. 7/10 (which would have been 8/10 if the ending had been up to the same standard as the rest).",

With two of his films, \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein\" represented in the Box Office top 10, he was America's funniest man. Mel Brooks has his own atypical style, but both pictures differ in their ways of being funny and it's almost an impossible task to agree on which one is the best. So in retrospect I watched his \"Blazing Saddles\", probably the funniest Western ever made. The story line is quite... well, let's call it unstructured. Though we can find a certain plot in this total mess. \"Blazing Saddles\" tells the tale about some untrustworthy land speculators who are constructing a railroad, with only one problem. The railroad needs to run through a town called Rock Ridge and they need to find a way to drive the townsfolk out. They hope to accomplish this by sending a black sheriff so the townspeople will revolt. Then again the film has so many things happening at the same time it's hard to give a good synopsis. Because in the end this film was created for the purpose of being funny, and damn it is! It feels like as if Mel Brooks can literally get away with anything, and people will let him say or do anything because he has earned this privilege since the distinctively funny debut: \"The Producers (1968)\". Brooks does everything to keep us laughing at the screen, and overall he succeeds. To truly understand these kind of films you must understand that this is an \"audience movie\". It is pure entertainment for your jaws and doesn't try to be an over-polished film in any way. And \"Blazing Saddles\" is pure entertainment from beginning to end, sure there are some slow bits though maybe these are a necessity to rest the jaw muscles for a while. \"Blazing Saddles\" is the perfect introduction for those who are not yet familiar with Brooks' work. What makes him stand out from your typical satirist is his ability to willingly embrace the redundancy of everything . His humor is more than just vulgarity and something he will always be remembered for. Brooks has no taste, which makes it in some weird way tasteful, and well, if you don't understand that, stick with your \"Scary Movie\" franchise I'd say.",

            "content": "After watching \"Young Frankenstein\" for the first time last month, it didn't take me very long to get around to seeing \"Blazing Saddles\". Quite a while before watching either film, I knew they were both very popular spoof movies from Mel Brooks, and were released the same year, over a decade before I was born. Brooks' spoof of 1930's Universal horror movies came into theatres in late 1974, and this western spoof of his came into theatres early that year. These were apparently his two most successful films. \"Young Frankenstein\" is an excellent flick, and after watching it, I may have expected to like its direct predecessor more than I did. The 30's Universal horror spoof is the stronger of the two, but this one is still good.In 1874, a new railroad is under construction in the Old West, and it eventually turns out that quicksand is in its way. Because of this, the construction must be taken in a different direction, and an evil state procurer named Hedley Lamarr plans to have it built through an area of land where a town called Rock Ridge currently stands, where everybody's surname is Johnson! First, he will have to find a way to drive all the townspeople out, so he sends in a group of henchmen to raid the town! After the sheriff of Rock Ridge is killed, the residents demand that Governor William J. LePetomane send them a new one. Hedley then gets an idea. He convinces the governor to appoint Bart, a black convict, as the new sheriff of the town, another scheme to try and get all the townspeople (all white) to leave. So, Bart rides into town and is obviously not welcomed by the town's racist residents. With the help of a town alcoholic named Jim (a.k.a. \"the Waco Kid\"), the new sheriff tries to win over the townspeople, while Hedley continues his attempts to bring down Rock Ridge! With a white worker named Lyle on the railroad trying to get the black workers to sing a spiritual song, the quicksand scene, and finally the \"tell them I said 'ow'\" gag, this spoof begins well. Occasionally, there are some pretty lame gags, such as the elderly woman being punched repeatedly by intruders, and cowboys sitting around a fire, eating beans, and farting. I also felt like I should have found a medieval executioner in the Wild West funnier than I did. However, most of the film is pretty funny, sometimes hilarious, and other highlights include the meeting in the church after the raid, Mel Brooks himself as the idiotic sex-crazed Governor William J. LePetomane (with the \"meeting adjourned\" gag and such), Bart's escape from gunpoint, Gene Wilder's first scene as Jim, and Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp. As usual, there are too many to mention. The first scene with Mongo is kind of annoying, and it seems like this character will really hurt the film, but fortunately, this quickly changes, as Mongo has some really funny scenes as well. The movie gets surprising towards the end, but in a good way.This hit 70's comedy from a renowned parody filmmaker may be slightly overrated, and too silly and crude for some viewers, but for the most part, I can understand its wide appeal. It's sometimes too silly and juvenile even for me, and may have been ahead of its time in that regard, but it doesn't get like this often enough to ruin it. I strongly suggest you don't watch \"Blazing Saddles\" if you can't take filth, political incorrectness, irreverence and immaturity in comedy, though far more shocking and raunchy comedies have been made in more recent years. However, if you like lunacy and edginess in your comedy, can take risqu\u00e9 humour, and are in the mood for some good laughs and a clever parody, this could easily be right up your alley. It's not the best spoof movie ever made, but Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have done SO much worse in the past several years, and I shouldn't even be comparing them!",

            "content": "Unfortunately, \"Blazing Saddles\" misses the mark as a good satire. In its supposed effort to spoof the movies over their stereotyping of races, this movie has degrading racist overtones. Making a black sheriff in a Western town might bring a chuckle. But then, racial slurs, innuendos and other portrayals of stereotyped African- Americans soon dispel any spoofing of racism. I didn't think this was very funny when I first saw the film shortly after it came out. And, it's still not funny, decades later. I suspect that this film got a lot of play and ballyhoo in the beginning because of a huge publicity and promo campaign that built it up as a spoof of prejudices. After a while, people will begin to believe the propaganda. Then, when watching some racist portrayals that actually feed such biases, many audiences are made to think that they are only appreciating a putting in place of the bigots. Yet the prejudicial pictures remain in one's mind. The idea of subliminal perception and its use in films to affect audience behaviors goes back a long way. Yet, blatantly derogatory things can be masked or covered over by the propaganda and publicity efforts of promoters who can convince many of the public that something just isn't so \u2013 or that it's something else. Hans Christian Andersen's story comes to mind \u2013 \"The Emperor's New Clothes.\"I don't think that Mel Brooks was a racist, or that he intended to spread racism in the making of this film. I think he is among those folks who look at humor first, and who see humorous aspects in things that may also have very dark sides. Whereas, for most people, the dark aspects take away any perception of humor. So, Brooks and people like him want to be able to laugh at what they see is funny, regardless of the dark side. I think that's what he was doing with this film. He made it for others like him who could see humor in otherwise bad, pathetic or distasteful situations. And, since most people would not be of the same ilk, in order to make his film acceptable to the mainstream public (if not to avoid outright criticism and picketing of the film), Warner Brothers had to make it palatable. So, they publicized and promoted the film as an assault on and spoof of prejudices. Just look at the promo on the DVD cover for the 30th Anniversary Special Edition. The promo calls it a \"spiffy spoof set in an 1874 Old West where 1974 Hollywood is just one sound stage away.\" It's a place \"where nonstop fun blasts prejudices to the high comedy heavens.\" What in the world can that mean? It's nothing, really, but a protestation that covers up the fact that the humor in the film is dark.In the world today, people abscond with words that we associate with good sentiments all the time. Wholesome, good things used to be described in the old phrase as befitting, \"baseball, motherhood, and apple pie.\" But today, people use such words to describe things that in their real direct language are quite distasteful or even horrible. Why shouldn't we expect anything less with the moguls of media \u2013 the experts and creators of mass communication in film, when they want to push a project or a movie? The bottom line of this film is that it's racist in itself. It is prejudiced in some other portrayals as well. It has very little witty or clever dialog. Few of the situations are funny. But it's wrap as being a film under production at the end, with fisticuffs breaking through other Hollywood sets, only smacks more to me of a clincher to deny the very racist and prejudicial nature of the film's portrayal of humor. Ever wonder why this movie wasn't set in the Deep South instead of the Old West?",

            "content": "Rock Ridge stands in the way of Hedley Lamarr's (Harvey Korman) railroad ambitions. In an attempt to drive the locals out he encourages the Governor to appoint Bart (Cleavon Little), an African American railroad labourer who was recently imprisoned for attacking his construction foreman. Lamarrs hopes that the locals will lose faith in the town and leave as they still have prejudice and biases towards African Americans.Barts appointment doesn't fail as expected, so Lamarr tries various other foolhardy schemes to rid the town of the sheriff and ultimately the entire local population. His final plan is to hire every thug, criminal and trigger happy drunkard to remove everyone by force. Once the locals find out LaMarrs intentions, they decide to leave, however Bart and Jim (Gene Wilder) convince them otherwise because of a genius strategy these have devised to foil Lamarr's plan.Gene Wilders acting in this film is quite outstanding. Comedy is rooted in truth, and Gene plays his character with so much vigour and sincerity. The scenes with Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little are hilarious - the entire sequence when they were playing chess is incredibly funny and serious. Their chemistry is fantastic.The sound quality and editing is amazing in this film. The original songs and score are great - added another dimension to the film.The film is labelled as a politically incorrect nightmare. However, whilst I agree with outward racism/sexism/bigotry being disparaged, I only support the condemnation of jokes or films that were done at the expense of these groups or individuals. Jokes and films done in good humour and mutual respect, poking fun at stereotypes or the uneducated in our culture, is entirely different. None of the jokes in Blazing Saddles were done at the expense of African Americans, rather they stood as examples of making American culture in the 1800s the punchline. The American Frontier culture and people were constantly reduced to unsophisticated cattle and portrays the whole enterprise as moronic. Ultimately in doing so, the film takes an indirect jab at modern Americans as they are descendants of these very people.The comedy in this film is much more rooted the chemistry of the actors, the timing, the jibes against the poorly educated, and the constant silly anachronisms.",

Prurient, anything-for-a-laugh western slapstick from Mel Brooks, who also appears as a bosom-mad governor and an Indian chief. It looks tacky and shabby, and some of the jokes completely bomb out, but the picture can get you laughing if you come across it in the requisite silly spirit. The loosely-hinged plot is just thrown away in the last reel, when Brooks apparently loses interest and turns the whole shebang into a spoof of Hollywood. Most of the cast survives the morass: frizzy-haired Gene Wilder nearly goes into his brand of weird mania (though he seems held back), Madeline Kahn is the belle of the ball as a Dietrich-like saloon singer with a Barbara Walters-like speech impediment, Harvey Korman is practically on fire as sniveling Hedley Lamarr (his name used for the basis of many jokes), and Dom DeLuise is, blessedly, brief as a director. Cleavon Little is well-suited for the sheriff, but he isn't given anything funny to say or do, and being the straight man doesn't work either since he's at the center of the action (Brooks turns him into a stationary prop). Despite more and more affection being heaped upon it over the years, \"Blazing Saddles\" is a hit-and-miss affair, though the jokes that 'hit' really do linger in the memory. **1/2 from ****",

The script is loaded with priceless one-liners, the sense of humor tends toward the manic, and the film features Mel Brooks' funniest role as the philandering governor (complete with \"GOV\" painted on his back.

Instead, what is suppose to pass for an audacious comedic plot comes off now in the same exact way it came off to me back then - as nothing but mere pandering: why, the very idea of a hip black sheriff in a bigoted white town! What a hilarious premise! This pandering is reinforced by the fact that Cleavon Little's character is so hip and cool - as if Brooks was afraid to make him the butt of any jokes - that Little, as the sheriff, is consistently and remarkably unfunny.Other aspects of the film, involving Brooks' typical overly broad and obvious style of humor, are also remarkably unfunny. For example, what elementary school grade were you in when you last doubled over in laughter at some kid crossing his eyes? This stupid, sub-adolescent shtick, employed by Brooks himself acting in the role of the governor, is pretty revealing of the extent of Brooks' comedic talent. I mean, if given the chance to be a player in his own movie, if he really and truly is the comedic genius that some claim he is, wouldn't he make more use of the opportunity and show us what he can really do? Or was that the best he could do - the cross-eyed lecher with \"THE GOV\" in bold letters on the back of his coat?Brings tears of laughter to your eyes just thinking about it, doesn't it?Add that kind of pathetic effort to the pandering, toss in an overly-indulgent use of sexual vulgarity as well as redundant bits that aren't funny to begin with, and you've got a film that is far more painful than funny to watch.What also doesn't help is watching talents like Harvey Korman, Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn trying their best to give it the old college try with such overbearing, poor material.On the other hand, if Korman getting off on a statue is your idea of funny, then you will probably love this movie.",

The latter had made the hilarious ( though unappreciated at the time ) 'The Producers' and the little-seen 'The Twelve Chairs'. With two flops to his credit, that should have been the last of him. Fortunately for us, Warner Bros. gave him the finance to make this outrageous Western spoof.Andrew Bergman had written a script called 'Tex X', about a black Sheriff sent to 'clean up' a crime-ridden town in The Wild West, only to find the bigoted locals don't appreciate his efforts. Brooks bought it, and along with other writers such as the brilliant Richard Pryor, made it funnier still.I didn't get to see 'Blazing Saddles' until 1978, when it was shown on a double-bill at my local theatre with 'Monty Python & The Holy Grail'. In those days, there was no Internet to give away the plots of movies, so I came to it not really knowing what to expect. By the time the final credits rolled, my sides ached from laughing too much. I was not alone. Even the usherette could not hold her torch properly.Before the Python movie got underway, we were treated to a trailer for a reissued Lee Van Cleef spaghetti Western, and the audience laughed. Having just sat through 'Blazing Saddles', it was impossible to take Westerns seriously any longer. Indeed the genre went out of fashion shortly after its release, and has yet to make anything resembling a full recovery.It brought a dose of much-needed reality to the cowboy flick by focusing on something the others had ignored - racial prejudice. When railroad workers encounter quicksand, they test its depth by ordering two black men to ride a handcart straight through it.Predictably, it sinks, yet the foreman is more concerned with saving the handcart than the men. Later, a wagon containing a black family is forced to travel in a circle by itself during an Indian attack because the whites don't want it in theirs. The 'N' word is bandied around an awful lot in this movie, I'm afraid, but serves a useful purpose. It reminds us how ignorant prejudiced people are. Only idiots ever use words of that calibre.The movie broke new ground in another respect. The now infamous campfire scene features cowboys eating beans and farting like there's no tomorrow. We are so used to farting in comedies now that it no longer has shock value, but back in those days it was akin to someone stepping on the moon for the first time.Cleavon Little, Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens, Gene Wilder and Brooks himself all contribute marvellous comic performances, ones we will treasure for as long as people love to laugh.Bad taste abounds; in one scene, an old woman is beaten up by thugs, and in another, a retarded man ( 'Mongo' ) blown up. P.C. this sure ain't. The ending in which the cowboy fight spills out of the studio and into an adjacent set where a Busby Berkeley-type musical is being made has proved controversial over the years, with many branding it a cop-out, but I disagree. Brooks knew exactly what he was doing.Funniest moment - it has to be the aforementioned campfire scene. I don't normally laugh at farting in movies, but here it feels so right. Mind you, it put me off beans for life.",

No need to dwell on the obvious.The other, however, only emerges at the end when the movie merges with reality as the battling factions carry their fisticuffs through the Warner Bros. lot onto the street.

But that's okay, because Rock Ridge is lived in by the most bigoted and inbred community in the country. Sheriff Bart is assisted in this task by the reformed drunk gunfighter The Waco Kid, played by Gene Wilder. The genius of BLAZING SADDLES can be seen in Brooks and his co-writers taking the actual history of the settlement of much of the United States, and making everyone laugh at some of the stupidities that have governed us for most of our existence as a country. No one is spared by this group of satirists (Richard Pryor contributed to the screenplay), the ax swings every direction. And thirty years after its release, the work remains screamingly funny.

It has the polish of a golden age Simpsons episode: i.e. there is no fat, just joke after joke after joke.I've scrolled through the reviews and quite rightly almost all are 8-10/10. This truly is one of the funniest films ever made. Like all the best parodies (the first Austin Powers film is a good example) it has a deep affection for what it is satirising.Then there is the odd 1-3 star review, most thankfully 20 years old. The common thread seems to be \"OMG the baddies said the bad words!\". Are some people so thin skinned that they can't cope with people in a movie who are either evil or at the start of an upward character path not being squeaky clean? I must go and read the reviews of Downfall, to see if the same kind of people are complaining the central character has opinions that just aren't acceptable in the modern world.And racist? I guess if I was a white supremacist I might have cause for complaint as most of the white folk are depicted as utterly dumb, but to try and say that it depicts scenes of black railroad workers being mistreated and is therefore condoning that treatment... I give up.Finally I'm baffled at the odd review claiming this is Mel Brooks' one stinker; this is the only film of his I like! It's like all the stars aligned for him this one time.",

            "content": "The funniest comedy film of all-time? While that might be stretching the praise a little far, Blazing Saddles is certainly a hugely enjoyable hour-and-a-half of inspired lunacy. Fast, rude, radical and so-racist-that-it-isn't-racist, it is a film that needs watching over and over just to pick up on the sheer number of verbal and visual jokes thrown at the audience. Mel Brooks, who co-wrote and directed this film, has probably never made anything better during his up-and-down career. Likewise, you'll have to look long and hard to find Gene Wilder in better form, giving a performance of comic genius as The Waco Kid. I only have to hear the deliriously silly title tune, with its over-the-top whip-cracks and wacky lyrics, to burst into fits of uncontrollable laughter.A railroad company fronted by the villainous Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman \u0096 wickedly funny) runs into a patch of quicksand whilst building a track across the Wild West. Their only option is to re-route the rail-line through the nearby town of Rock Ridge. Lamarr instructs his heavies to empty the town, scaring the townfolk away by killing their sheriff and intimidating them with violence. But when the townspeople refuse to budge, Lamarr has to come up with a more radical plot. He spares the life of a condemned black railroad slave Bart (Cleavon Little), and sends him to Rock Ridge as the replacement sheriff. Lamarr figures that the locals will be so disgruntled at having a black sheriff that they'll give up the ghost and skip town. It seems the scheme is going to plan as the citizens give Bart a less than glowing reception. But soon, the black sheriff proves himself to be quite good at his job, especially when he ingeniously disposes of a psychotic, gigantic bad guy named Mongo (Alex Karras) who comes to flatten the town. Bart teams up with an alcoholic ex-gunfighter named The Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) \u0096 renowned for having the fastest hands in the West - and together they try to wipe out the army of outlaws and gunslingers allied against them.Blazing Saddles has moments of sheer hilarity that get funnier every time you watch. Madeline Kahn's deliberately out-of-tune rendition of \"I'm Tired\" for a bar-room full of rowdy cowpokes is utterly fabulous; then there's the brilliant opening sequence in which a bunch of cowboys try to hold a singing contest against the black slaves; Wilder has a priceless moment where he seizes a chess piece so fast that his opponent doesn't even see him move; and who can forget the insane climax in which a brawl in a Wild West street spills over into the Hollywood studio next door, where Dom DeLuise's camp director is trying to shoot a musical number?!? Cleavon Little is rather limited as the black sheriff Bart (perhaps Richard Pryor might have been better for this role?) but he is surrounded by such proved comic talent that he just about gets away with it. The dialogue is marvellous throughout, with verbal witticisms coming so thick and fast you'll probably miss half of them on the first viewing. Few films can match Blazing Saddles for sheer belly laughs \u0096 terrific fun!",

Most projectionists (like critics) are a difficult lot to please, simply through the amount of product you got to view. No film in that 30 year period 'hit' all our crew like this film did. A roaring Frankie Laine song over the opening credits falsely lead you into thinking this was going to be 'another cowboy movie', how wrong could you be? It hit us like nothing before and whilst films like Airplane & Life of Brian rose to challenge it was, and still is, the best comedy (and my favourite film) ever. You need to watch this film at least half a dozen times to get all the gags, both visual & oral (those that saw the noose around the horses neck fell out of their seat laughing - those that missed it were bemused). I must have watched it 200 times or more. The jokes are great, many stand up to this day and whilst some people simply don't get the irony or the change in scenario (e.g. Lily Von Stupp leading a Nazi singalong or the end sequence), at the time this was (and still is) hilariously brilliant. The casting was perfect, Little, Wilder, Korman, Khan, Brooks, Pickens, Deluise and a wonderful supporting cast ran with a gem of a script. As someone correctly stated, this is a film made when we were all allowed to laugh at & with each other rather than the political correctness of today. In the UK this film was a 'sleeper' which meant it started off to average audiences but once word of mouth got around the cinema was full for weeks. It returned for several other runs and when it was doubled with Airplane it took a boat load of money once again. If you can get the DVD with Mel being interviewed it's worth the effort.

Just about every racial stereotype you can think of is here, including Mel Brooks as a very Jewish native American chief, as well as plenty of slurs and insults that grate on the nerves and numerous sequences that drag their heels and wind up absolutely nowhere. After such a promising start with The Producers - where Brooks made his intentions clear from the get-go, filling the screen with parallel universe grotesques, broadly drawn caricatures and bad taste madness that effectively defused criticisms in the manner of the most florid twenties slapstick - Mel Brooks seemed to fall into the trap of thinking everything he did was comic gold, and there weren't enough people willing to tell him it wasn't.

But unlike \"The Producers\", which worked because the bad taste was ridiculous, the bad taste in \"Blazing Saddles\" is just plain bad taste.We start with a mixed racial group of laborers working in the hot sun on a railroad track being visited by several supervisors. One worker faints from the heat and the supervisor says, \"Dock this Chink a day's pay for sleeping on the job.\" Ha, ha, cruelty is funny. Then we hear the supervisor asking why the black workers aren't singing like they did as slaves. They sing a song the supervisor doesn't expect, and pretend not to know \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\". Two workers fall into quicksand, but the supervisors are very casual about rescuing them (though they do). Next, the supervisor goes to the big boss to tell them the rail line must be rerouted, and to do so requires them to destroy a town in the way. The supervisor brags about how they want to cruelly slaughter the town's residents, but spare the women for raping. After twenty minutes of this sidesplitting hilarity, I had enough and turned it off.Yes, even bad taste can be funny, but not so with this movie. We're supposed to laugh at people making cheap racial insults and plotting to do terrible things to innocent people. If you think rape is funny, this should be the movie for you.Some reviewers make the case that the movie is supposed to be an attack on racism because the white people who spew racial insults are supposed to be idiots and the blacks look good in comparison.

There are many memorable moments with hilarious characters, most of them are just fools so that works perfect. The governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks), definitely my favourite character in the entire film even he only appears in a couple of scenes, leads the authorities and has in Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) is right hand. Lamarr has his own right hand in the chief of the people working in the new railroad. So in these characters we have the classic bastards with power in the Old West. Their future victims are the people in the quiet town of Rock Ridge because is the place where the new railroad is going to pass so they MUST leave their town even if they don't want. But here is when the great and funny things of the film are because the people of Rock Ridge are the classic victims but actually they are just racist morons so the governor and pals send a black man as the new sheriff (Cleavon Little) being sure that the people in town will never accept him and they are going to leave the town. But what those morons don't know is that this new sheriff is going to be the hero in this story and also the one who ends with the ignorance of the people in the town where the only normal man was the drunk of town (Gene Wilder) who was actually a true legend of the old West and he was known as The Waco Kid.Is just great how Mel Brooks makes fun upon the classic politicians but at the same he is making fun upon the people for the town, a town full of ignorance and racism. So the protagonist roles are for two unusual heroes that make that the people learn to work as a team even with simple and absurd plans that works perfect if your enemies are politicians. And the end is just original and very funny leaving a bizarre thought to the tourist of how the people eat in Hollywood and with the protagonist watching his own film. A great end!The Cast: is magnificent. Cleavon and Gene are a funny and a unique couple but my favourite performances are the ones of the politicians. My favourite is Mel Brooks with only three scenes (one as the Indian chief) that are just hilarious. Madeline Kahn is also very good with that famous dance scene but I don't really know if her Oscar nomination for best actress in a supporting role was really deserved.Conclusion: \"Blazing Saddles\" is definitely one of my favourites films of Mel Brooks and a really funny Western. Nothing else to add just that if you haven't seen it, well go and get it. Hail to Mel Brooks! Hail to Mongo for hitting that horse!",

Basically, it is based in the American Old West of 1874 in a town called Rock Ridge, with all but the Governor Lepetomane (Mel Brooks, also playing an Indian chief) with the surname Johnson. A gang of thugs, led by the dastardly Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman), often mistaken for the actress Hedy Lamarr are invading the town, causing the townspeople demanding a new sheriff. When one comes along, they weren't expecting a Ni... (that a quote by the way, \"Ni...\"), African American railroad worker named Bart (BAFTA nominated newcomer Cleavon Little) to be the new sheriff. The only friend that Bart has for a while is alcoholic gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder), once known as 'The Waco Kid' for his fast hands. Anyway, they eventually convince the town to build a fake town to fool the bad guys, they fall for it, and they attack, and doing this happen to crash into a Hollywood studio production. The bad guys and Lamarr are defeated, Bart and Jim get to see the end of their movie, and Bart makes everyone accept coloured people.

His comedy films, a blend of pop culture, Jewish humor, sexual innuendo, satire and funny dialogue, each take after this first hit. Blazing Saddles is a parody of the Western, but in a more in-your-face and unapologetic manner than the more subdued \"Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid\" (1969) a fllm which this film may also be satirizing. Mel Brooks stars as a corrupt sheriff who, to preserve his position in a small Western town in the 19th century, deliberately appoints a black sheriff (Cleavon Little) Bart, which provokes controversy and ignites mayhem. Cleavon Little is not as well known today but he typified the comic black actor of the 70's, the kind you saw on Saturday Night Live. He was never as popular as Eddie Murphy who could have easily taken on this role, but he is hilarious, mannered and the one who steals the show in this film. It's especially enjoyable (and not racist one bit) to see him succeed and outsmart the whites in the town. The powerful comic duo that was Mel Brooks and Madeline Kahn would work together again in various subsequent films including High Anxiety (1977) and History of the World (1980). Brooks is his usual great self but he does seem fresh and had not developed his full comic powers at this point. On the other hand, Madeline Kahn displays the talent she would show audiences in each of the films that followed this one. As a saloon dancer/showgirl, complete with a Marlene Dietrich impersonation, she's hilarious and superb, but never over-the-top. It's interesting to note that this film would have floundered if all the actors had stepped up the comedy. They are clearly comic actors doing a prolonged Western skit but they act as if this is a serious Western and take themselves serious, AND IT WORKS! Gene Wilder had done comedy before and he is doing a fine job here as The Wacko Kid, especially funny because he always looks so sheepish and vulnerable. He is a fine actor. At this time, he had just finished work on a memorable performance as Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1973) only a year earlier. He is clearly better as Willy Wonka because he had more of a chance to act on that film whereas in this film he is almost a secondary actor and more subdued. The look is great, almost too great for a comic film, but this is exactly the kind of \"anti-movie movie\" that Mel Brooks was famous for. It's a movie that makes fun of the movies. And audiences saw the first glimpse of the kind of entertainment Mel Brooks would deliver for years to come.",

But this plays in a time where this word was being used and it was used in a very demeaning way.So be aware that Mel Brooks couldn't care less about your political correctness. He goes places that feel uncomfortable (the joke about Jews/Israel and the first born ... not sure a Hollywood movie would actually go through with having a line like that in their movie). The actors are good though and they are selling everything.

He hires Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged.The \"plot\" kind of thins out from there. I judged Blazing Saddles purely on entertainment value. I really love Gene Wilder, who played the Waco Kid who helps Bart. His sarcastic tone of voice and his love for comedy really shines through. Little was enjoyable as the sheriff. The town of Rock Ridge had it's own jokes (i.e. Johnson, etc.) that were funny throughout.Some jokes didn't have any taste (the campfire scene), while others were perfect for a Disney movie (a laurel and hearty handshake). Brooks' role in the movie, even though it was small, was very humorous, and it's fun to go along with Bart and Jim (aka the Waco Kid).If there was one thing I didn't like, it was that Madeline Kahn didn't have a larger role.

Blazing Saddles, like Revenge Of The Nerds, is a movie that simply can't be made today unless the producers are willing to deal with the complaints from various ethnic groups about the way they portray their people. It has become tiresome to see every ethnic or focus group complain about the stereotypes shown when in fact they are based on truths and that if they made a film based on their ethnic group i.e. My Big, Fat Greek Wedding we'd see the people portrayed the same way others would see them. Back in the 70's, people laughed at themselves and their mannerisms. Blazing Saddles did more to unite the races with laughter and Mel Brooks deserves a lot of credit for this.Blazing Saddles also takes a lot of heat for its \"cop-out ending\" but people need to realize that this is a spoof of the western; nobody should take it seriously as if it was High Noon. Some people whine and say that they could have created a suitable ending to the film but to be honest, the one provided seems feasible to me. Besides, the characters in this film are wacko. You had to know that something crazy would happen in the end.The film still stands at the top of the great comedies. The performances from Harvey Korman, Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens, and Alex Karras, among others, still are top-notch.

LePetomaine mocking Harvey Korman's Hedley Lamarr by calling him Hedy Lamarr (and stating that \"She isn't born yet, you could sue her.\") to the classic \"Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!\" to Madeline Kahn's Lili Von Shtupp saying for the second time that \"I want to slip into something more comfortable\" or Gene Wilder's Waco Kid delivering his hilarious stories, it never loses it zing.Still, the story is entertaining and intriguing and the characters make this movie work. Whether we will see people return to the laid-back 70's beliefs in public is debatable but we will always have these films that shows us that we could laugh at ourselves over our ethnicity. Maybe someone like Al Sharpton will look at these classic films and realize that the way it used to be wasn't so bad...ah, probably not. He would no longer have anything to offer news-wise.",

This takes place in 1874 during Western times in small town, Rockridge. Korman (The Carol Burnett Show) plays Hedley Lamarr (Not Hedy Lamarr), a corrupt politician who tries to make Rockridge unlivable and decides to appoint black slave, Bart (Little) as it's new sheriff thinking he won't be able to bring order to it. Bart gets off to a tough start, but eventually succeeds and wins the town's support. Wilder (Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory) plays Jim, aka The Waco Kid, a former gunslinger who befriends Bart, the late, Kahn (Young Frankenstein) plays German singer, Lili Von Schtupp and Brooks appears as the Governor, William Lepetomane and as an Indian Chief.

Maybe it's because I haven't seen enough Westerns to fully appreciate all the references. Maybe it's because I have seen so many films of this ilk that the formula has become tiresome (even though many would argue that this movie was one of the trailblazers of the genre). Or maybe it's because I just don't really like Mel Brooks' work in general. Like a lot of Brooks' movies, Blazing Saddles feels more like a stage production than a film, with some pantomime acting and overly self-aware gags.I can certainly understand why it's so popular and wouldn't question all the acclaim it gets. The lead characters are pretty good, particularly Cleavon Little and the stunning Madeline Kahn. The jokes come thick and fast and, while they do become a bit predictable and tiresome as the film progresses, there are a few gems in there. The racism stuff becomes a little weary and I feel like Brooks is desperately showing us how progressive and open-minded he is by tackling the subject so bluntly. Blazing Saddles is one of the more celebrated comedies of the 20th century, but it is starting to feel increasingly dated.",

In it a man is named sheriff for a small out-of-the-way town for political reasons and to cause controversy. You see, the man, played by Cleavon Little, happens to be of African origins. Oh the outrage!I actually haven't seen all that many Mel Brooks films, but I do recognize this style. Leslie Nielsen went on to make whole career out of movies such as these. Movies where everything can happen, the action is never too intense to stop for a quick quip and where everything is played for laughs.It's a very random sort of comedy. The governor might be a punch drunk boxer. There might be a band playing in the middle of a desert for no reason. A toll booth might suddenly appear out of nowhere. No rhyme, no reason. It's very \"and the kitchen sink too\" approach to comedy. Seeing what will stick and what will not.And, admittedly, when the film works, it works really well. But the reason it works is more thanks to its clever writing and good dialogue. This movie has some of the best lines ever seen in a comedy. Proven by the fact that people are still quoting this film. People that have not even seen it.Alas, the kitchen sink approach means that not all of the jokes will land. There are moments that will leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. And I think the reason why some movies, like the Monty Python ones, can get away with such pure randomness, is the fact that even though they're random, it's still internally consistent. The world of the Holy Grail is an odd one, but it never treats itself as such. It never winks at its audience. Blazing Saddles winks at you so much that you'd think it was suffering from a stroke.All in all, Blazing Saddles is an enjoyable hour and a half of pure goofing off.

The visuals, sets, music, landscapes, and even the camerawork/editing evokes the feel of 50s/60s American westerns almost perfectly, just as well as Young Frankenstein evokes old 30s/40s horror movies.Also, Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder have genuinely great chemistry, and provide a little heart to the film, buried under the huge mountain of jokes on display here.

            "content": "Mel Brooks is generally regarded as one of the greatest comedy directors, but a lot of people overlook that most of his movies have really bad endings and only about one out of every four jokes works. This is a movie that I have tried to find funny on multiple occasions, but very consistently I get bored at around the thirty minute mark or so. At this point, I think I've compiled a bunch of issues the movie has and can thoroughly explain as to why I don't think it is really funny or even worth watching.I know this seems like an odd thing to critique in a comedy, but plot and character investment are actually super important for any comedy to be funny and to keep the audience's attention for long periods of time. It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Hot Fuzz, Rat Race, Groundhog's Day, or even Life of Brian all have a relatively good balance of plot versus comedy. Just throwing in jokes won't hook an audience. Blazing Saddles starts off with a funny premise and there is some investment in the new African American Sheriff being able to save the town from the generic bad guy, but it very quickly becomes in incoherent mess where it feels like the film got edited by a blender. Certain scenes like Bart having to fight off Mongo are important for the character's growth, the town's appreciation of him, and for Mongo's character growth a couple of scene later on. However, the fight with Mongo ends in about 5 seconds with a Looney Tunes gag and is entirely unsatisfying. The whole point of the scene is supposed to be that Mongo is nearly indestructible and that Bart has to be intelligent and use his wits to both beat Mongo and win over the town. However, none of this is really seen and it makes all of the build up of Mongo seem utterly pointless.Another person we run into is a prostitute who is hired to seduce Bart (I don't think we ever really learn how this would help the villain's plan) but then she ends up falling in love with him. Later on, she is tied up by the bad guy as a damsel in distress, but then we see her walking around with everyone in the next scene. If this were made into a joke about how horrible the movie's continuity is then that might be clever, but there are multiple instances of stuff like that happening in this film that are never really mentioned or explained and the only excuse people really have for it is, \"Well, it doesn't need continuity because it's a satire\" which really isn't an excuse nor does it make the movie any more entertaining.Unfortunately, just like all the other Mel Brooks films, there are extensive meta jokes and fourth wall jokes that completely kill the pacing of the film. The finale of the film has the main characters running through different L.A. movie sets and studios, but the focus is more on the other movies that are being shot rather than the one we were currently in. This premise had the potential to at least be a tiny bit funny if it were focused on our main characters and were recreating Western tropes but in a non-western setting, yet it is almost entirely wasted. It just feels like Mel Brooks gave up trying to make a funny comedy somewhere around the 50 minute mark and just started throwing in random jokes and hoped some of them would stick (there are still a couple of funny moments here and there).All in all, Blazing Saddles is a comedy that starts off with a lot of strong moments, but quickly fizzles out as it isn't quite sure what to do with the content that it has. It could have been a masterpiece, but as is I would say it's pretty dull.",

They obviously resist this, so Korman sends Cleavon Little to the town to replace their sheriff who had been killed by Korman's cronies. Cleavon Little, being black does not go over so well at first, but after a while everyone comes together to defeat Korman and the idiot Mayer played by Mel Brooks.

            "content": "I'm not alone in considering \"Blazing Saddles\" among the trifecta of Mel Brooks's best comedies, along with two of his other early efforts, \"The Producers\" (1967) and \"Young Frankenstein\" (1974). Each one is well conceived beyond the jokes themselves, which have always tended to be hit and miss and often immature. I guess you either find flatulence funny or you don't. Regardless, the humor is rapid fire, so a miss here and there isn't much of a problem when they're quickly replaced with gags that do work. \"The Producers\" has the play-within-the-play and the Jewish mockery of Hitler, following in the footsteps of Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" (1940) and the also-Jewish Ernst Lubitsch's \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942), which Brooks as producer remade. \"Young Frankenstein,\" which I also recently reviewed, doesn't have the satirical punch of the other two, but I think, with co-writer Gene Wilder, it's their most-organized and best-looking parody--largely because they adopt the episodes and style from the classic Universal Frankenstein films, which makes it more of an homage than is \"Blazing Saddles,\" which savagely ridicules the prevalent racism of that staple genre of classic Hollywood cinema, the Western, and by extension, American history.It's the politically-incorrect jokes and the profane use of racial slurs that gets this point across, from inserting a black sheriff in a Reconstruction-era Western settlement. Less attention is given to the Chinese and Irish railroad workers and Indians, but they're in the same boat. Plus, the Yiddish-speaking impersonation of a Native American by Brooks is an ingenious mockery of the tradition of white actors playing racist Indian stereotypes in Hollywood Westerns. I'm not so fond of the gay jokes, including the musical routine of a director and an entire cast of effeminate male stereotypes, as they seem to come off more at the expense of homosexuals, but this was 1974, and I'm not about to feign offense when the film's object is to expose offenses by being itself offensive, and, in the spirit of the Western, there are generally casualties along the route.The parody of Western tropes is quite effective, too. The romanticism of the railroad, that frontier spirit of Manifest Destiny and those supposed great white men leading the way are pillaged. Hangings, inexplicable quicksand traps, the giant oaf, who ridiculously knocks out a horse here, the gibberish-speaking townsman, the bible-thumping priest and, of course, an absurd brawl that consumes entire groups until there are no bystanders--all movie conventions hilariously made fun of here. There's also Wilder playing the hackneyed drunken gunslinger, as though he were impersonating Dean Martin in \"Rio Bravo\" (1959), or countless other characters from the genre. Madeline Kahn, in an Oscar-nominated performance, is fabulous in her lisping burlesque of Marlene Dietrich, such as her role in \"Destry Rides Again\" (1939).To top off its parody and satirical deconstruction of the Reconstruction-era Western, the town and its populace are literally reconstructed as a ruse for the baddies and, consequently, exposing the film's very own artifice. The ensuing brawl, then, escalates, reductio ad absurdum, to the self-reflexive deconstruction of this very film itself. First, it does so by spilling over its own boundaries into the set of another movie of a different genre, the musical, and, second, to other parts of the studio, including a pie fight in its cafeteria. Then, it becomes the ultimate mise-en-abyme, as the characters attend a screening of this very film at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. This is one of the all-time great endings.",

The movie's story is what you'd expect of a traditional western film only with elements of satire and slapstick in the way only a person like Mel Brooks can make it happen. The story of the movie has to do with a plan to build a railroad track that leads into a town called rock ridge which would anger the residents and drive them out. The plan is orchestrated by a corrupt politician who happens to be the Attorney General named Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) who wants to make that town as empty as possible and convinces the Governor (Mel Brooks) to appoint a black Sherriff named Bart (Cleavon Little) to maintain order in the town (which is the last thing that Lamarr wants) but also to anger all of the townsfolk and drive them away even faster. On his first day on the job the citizens of Rock Ridge are shocked to find that they have a black Sherriff which he takes with a calm attitude and thick skin, then he meets a drunken man in a prison cell named Jim (Gene Wilder) who used to be known as \"The Waco Kid\" back in the day and spends his time drinking. then Bart meets a German woman named Lili Von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) who is hired by Lamarr to seduce him which she succeeds but then she becomes his friend and ally afterwards, which that happens ater an illiterate juggernaut called Mongo (Alex Karras) rides into town on an ox with orders to kill the sherriff and that plan failed while also becoming fond of the sherriff for single handedly defeating him. After all those plans fail Lamarr has no choice but to hire all kinds of criminals to get the people to leave town. The movie is laugh out loud hilarious from start to finish which is typical of Brooks films especially his directorial debut with \"The Producers\" (1967) which was also hilarious.

The film was dull and the humor was extremely offensive, and since I saw it in a first-run theater I'm not talking about it not \"aging well\" or being offensive by today's standards: I'm talking about forty years ago, being a teenager and realizing how offensive and un-funny it was. If I'd realized that walking out was an option, I might have... but I would have had to walk home since I was too young to drive.So many of the performers were capable of so much better... the \"waste of talent\" factor was very high. The great Harvey Korman, for example, never failed to get a laugh from us on \"The Carol Burnett Show\". Here, we just felt sorry for him. Poor Harvey, trapped in this boring and tasteless movie.I'd just like to mention that I'm not now nor have I ever been much of a prude. Give me crude humor that's actually funny, I'll go for it. My taste is pretty broad and includes such movies as \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". It's entertaining. That's all I ever ask of a film. I'll never understand all the great reviews, or how it got such good reviews from \"professional\" critics at the time of its release.",

            "content": "RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Mel Brooks, \"Blazing Saddles\" is a Western parody starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder as the newly appointed black sheriff of Rock Ridge and his deputy, the Waco Kid. Rather than chasing away the inhabitants they corral them against the corrupt politicians who threaten their town. Mel Brooks plays the Governor (as well as an Indian Chief) and Harvey Korman the conniving State Attorney General. Slim Pickens and a gazillion others guest star. Little got the lead role of Sheriff Bart over Richard Pryor, who co-wrote the screenplay and was intended for the part himself. Producers, however, were reluctant due to Pryor's racy repute and so opted for the safer choice of Little, who's great in the role.Pansy, over-sensitive liberals rail against the movie due to its political incorrectness, but that's like complaining that water is wet. The humor is intentionally offensive, stupid, juvenile, crude, vulgar and silly. Some of it's funny while some of it falls flat or is too dumb or dated for modern viewers; it just depends on the person watching. I laughed enough and enjoyed the classic cast to give the flick a marginal 'thumbs up.' Some say a movie like this would never be made by Hollywood today. Really? I guess they've never seen \"Django Unchained\" (2012) or \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015). On the female front, ravishing honey-voiced Robyn Hilton has a too-brief part as the governor's \"secretary\" and Madeline Kahn, in her prime at 31, has a more significant role as a Marlene Dietrich-like saloon entertainer. More shoulda been done with both of 'em. THE FILM RUNS 93 minutes and was shot at Burbank Studios, Santa Clarita & Vasquez Rocks, California. GRADE: B-",

More impressively, it's able to make those wild leaps from pointed, hilarious dialog to silly sight gags to dense, dark satire without disrupting the flow of the story and becoming an undisciplined series of loosely-related skits (though it does come awfully close once or twice).

And of course, there's the whole town full of rather-inbred people named Johnson, and Harvey Korman's character, whose name is a reference to Hedy Lamarr.Many have labeled the humor racist.

It's interesting to watch now, because while the film is one that I, along with pretty much everyone else whose seen it, really liked, it shows traces of the side of Mel Brooks that likes gravitating towards cheap and crude humor that would take over the rest of Mel Brooks' career.Blazing Saddles, a parody of the Wild West, centers around a railroad magnate who plans to clear a town he needs for his rail line by using his influence with the governor (Mel Brooks, in the best part of the movie) to convince him to appoint a black sheriff (Cleavon Little) for the new town. He figures that the town will run the sheriff out of town rendering them defenseless when the railroad strongarms them out of their homes.Blazing Saddles still had the relatively intelligent humor that one could see in his other parody released in 1974 \"Young Frankenstein.\" A film academic could appreciate its clever metacinematic ending in which a brawl in a Western town spills over onto a studio lot and a movie villain tries to escape his own fate by going into a movie theater. It was also just plain hilarious and jam-packed with laughs that left audiences and critics defenseless. At the same time, the movie repeatedly dipped into crude humor and had the potential to be offensive in the way that his later films would soon follow the pattern of. It's possible for a movie to both deliver intelligent humor and be really stupid at the same time and I would give a good review to Blazing Saddles for its intelligent humor but I would be doing so because its pros outweigh the cons and I think (and most would agree) Brooks has unfortunately gone downhill since then.

            "content": "\"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), the title leaves the appropriate abbreviation to describe this \"film\"; B.S. (I'm sure that most of you understand what I'm referring to. But, I'm trying to keep my written film reviews PG). I know what most of you are thinking: \"what?! You don't like this movie?\" Okay, to be fair, I actually did like this \"film\" the first couple of times I watched it. But, the more I watched it, the more I noticed the flaws. Now that I'm in my career of film and animation, I see movies and shows differently and know how to critique them properly. Unlike \"professional\" critics, I'm not afraid to be honest with my reviews. The reality is, \"Blazing Saddles\" is one of the unfunniest movies I've ever seen. Stupid and cliched story, overall horrible acting and a very dull generic soundtrack. The story is essentially about racism. I don't mind racism, it doesn't offend me. If it's done properly in movies, including comedies, it can actually be effective, or funny, when telling the story. However, in the case of this \"film\", most people that are sensitive to racial stereotypes will most likely hate it. This is the basic outline of the story; a black sheriff takes over in an all-white town. How is that supposed to be funny? There is a running gag where one of the townspeople tries to stereotype the sheriff, but a loud noise always interrupts the word itself. That was funny the first couple of times, but after that, it just becomes repetitious and therefore is not funny anymore. To do comedy properly, you have to follow a fine line between stupid and over the top. \"Blazing Saddles\" is in peaks and valleys on that chart! There's a huge difference between comedy and stupidity. \"Blazing Saddles\" is the epitome of stupidity, while being way too over the top. As for the acting, it ranges from okay, to just horrible. The only somewhat tolerable performances in this \"movie\" are from; Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks. They seem to be the only ones who actually look like they're putting forth some sort of effort. But, sadly a poor script and bad direction kept them from shining in this \"film\". All of the other actors and actresses range from mediocre to just horrible. It's a shame, because all of the actors and actresses are very talented in other movies and shows! What happened to them here? Mel Brooks in particular is a brilliant writer and director. However, this has to be one of his worst films he's written and directed. Finally, the soundtrack is dull, boring and not memorable whatsoever. It's all over the place, just like the plot line of this \"movie\"! Now for the positives, yes, there are a couple of positives in this \"film\". The sets/locations are nice and give a decent atmosphere. All of the special effects were very well-done and still hold up today. Sadly, good sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for a bad story and horrible acting. \"Blazing Saddles\" is a lousy \"movie\" and it always will be. Glad I got this review over with! I give this \"movie\" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. If any of you are planning to write comedy movies or TV shows, always remember my personal chart. Walk the fine line between stupid or over the top. Do not exceed either side of the line! Otherwise, you'll get a \"movie\" like \"Blazing Saddles\". It makes me cringe just thinking about it. There is no laughter to be found in this \"film\", it is simply nothing but a boring and dull cringe-fest!",

The plot is weak but that can be forgiven as this is suppose to be a silly comedy. But the use of the racial slur joke is overworked and just about any other joke offered up in this film is sophomoric at best, stupid at worst. And while there are a couple of scenes that may bring a smile or a laugh to the viewer, I think most would be better off watching this film for what it is: A bad film that is a showcase for the various supporting Hollywood actors and actresses from about 30 years ago.

Then there is Blazing Saddles, a film that not only pushes the envelope, but also eats it, digests it, and disposes of it. Decades later there still isn't a movie quite like this, and could not be released in the sensitive time period of today. Whether it's the extreme racism, the humorous abuse towards animals, or total lack of remorse towards any minority whatsoever, Blazing Saddles bends, breaks, and eats the rules of courtesy. Becoming the highest-grossing picture of 1974, and emerging into one of the greatest comedies of all-time, this is one of those movies that everyone has to see at least once. Here we see Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor at their prime.In this western satire and criticism, we find a black man being appointed sheriff, must to the disdain of the white citizens of Rock Ridge. What none of them know is that the reason for the hiring is that Rock Ridge holds some very valuable land and a greedy political figure by the name of Hedy Lamarr (oops\u0085Hedley) is doing whatever it takes to obtain it after wiping out the citizens. Unfortunately for Lamarr, the new sheriff Bart, armed with a drunken partner the Waco Kid, is winning the hearts of the folks in the town. Throughout the movie it's a constant struggle to run out the citizens of the town and end Bart's reign as the top cop of the area.There are very few spoofs that carry a good plot as well as an abundance of comedic material. Written by Brooks and Pryor, they were determined to hold no punches back as they weave a slew of unheard of humor into the film. They range from modern physical humor involving body parts, to racist wisecracks, to animal abuse that would make PETA go psycho, to below-the-radar analysis of the mythology of the Wild West. Blazing Saddles went out to prove that the West wasn't as simple as heroes against villains; we have corrupt politicians, Manifest Destiny ideals that desecrated Natives, Blacks, and Asians, and we have gullible people left and right accepting all the wrongdoing going on. Besides all the racy material, Brooks and company were daring in terms of challenging an entire genre and its portrayal of a beloved time period.The one-liners, gags, and subtle moments are thrown at you from the beginning to the very end. Thankfully and luckily for Brooks, there was a very talented staff to hold it all together. Standing out amongst the actors was Cleavon Little as Bart, and Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid. The two have excellent chemistry together and play their parts with such ease. Everyone else delivers in once scene or another, most notably the brute Alex Karras as the dumb yet physically overpowering Mongo. His first interaction with a horse stands as one of the funniest moments in cinema history\u0097and certainly one of the most shocking. Madeline Kahn was decent in her Oscar-nominated portrayal of Lili Von Shtupp, as she gives a musical number worthy of yawning over.Not for the easily offended, Blazing Saddles makes Borat look like Sesame Street. Packing a heavy punch of vulgar language, no religion or minority is safe, as we see insults towards the Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Irish, Germans, French, Indians, and folks from Kansas. We see Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, renegade Mexicans, cowboys that violate animals, and worst of all flamboyant musical dancers. Not all jokes hit, but when they do miss, it usually is ricocheted by an even better joke. For example, contrary to popular opinion, the low point of the movie is when it slows down to make way for the major musical number; but afterwards we get a funny sequence involving breakfast and sausages.The fourth wall isn't broken here either; it's pulverized. At first it is lightly cracked, but when the third act and the main climax approaches, you'll feel like the actors and actresses are parading across the screen and into your world. Adding to the mayhem is one of the longest yet most ridiculous and satisfying fights in history. Starting out in a small setting, it expands into places so unpredictable; it can wind up confusing the viewer. Blazing Saddles has something for everybody, as long as you are willing to laugh at offensive material that exists merely to prove a point.Bottom Line: One of the funniest movies of all-time, Blazing Saddles holds up well even after all these years. The writing is what excels here, but great acting and good directing also helps. The pacing is a bit slow like the average Western, but with so much humor flying at the screen you won't care. By the time the movie is over you'll see it all; from exploding horses to farting cowboys. See it once for the humor; see it again for the commentary. This is Brooks at his creative peak, and Pryor in one of his few successful cinema stints.\"Someone's gotta go back and get a ****-load of dimes!\"",

That's how life is anyway.So here Brooks uses his usual gags from sex to bodily functions, spanning the first- through eighth-grade level.  These are superficial laughs, nothing else.

'Beetlejuice' and 'Death Becomes Her' have the advantage of taking a human issue (death), but 'Saddles doesn't have anything.He hasn't changed, his method of deriving humor from the work of others has, unfortunately, helped spawn the garbage of the Zucker brothers.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",

            "content": "My introduction to the wacky world of Mel Brooks came from the admittedly mediocre medieval parody Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993). Its funny for the most part, but those in my generation who are adamant supporters of the merry romp probably haven't seen it since they were knee high. Today the movie is as aged as a pair of hand-me-down gym socks. Though I suppose for children of the 70's Up in Smoke (1978) probably existed before there was \"bad taste\".Blazing Saddles (1974) lives beyond the realm of bad taste and mediocrity. While aiming to please a mass audience and appeal to baser senses, Mel Brooks created a timeless classic that is masterful in its execution of politically incorrect irreverence. A western parody of epic proportions. A wondrous side splitting comedy\u0085I may be getting ahead of myself.For those who are not familiar with Mel Brooks and his perilous mix of high-brow and low- brow comedy, Blazing Saddles concerns the troubles of the western town of Rockridge. The people are being forced out by a politically connected bad guy (Harvey Korman), looking to cash in on the railroad craze. Requesting a new sheriff from the corrupt governor, the townspeople are surprised and angered by the appearance of Bart (Cleavon Little), a black man willing to take the job.In addition to being famous as the mainstream introduction to the fart joke, Blazing Saddles is also noted or its frank and often hilarious treatment of racism. The N-word is uttered over thirty times over the course of a 90 minute movie, and the attitude towards African- Americans, Chinese-Americans, Native-Americans and the Irish is over-the-top bigotry on the part of the townspeople.Cleavon Little plays Bart as a bright, savvy and appealing young man who is constantly at odds with the narrow-minded townsfolk and greedy villains. His only friend is a former gunslinger turned career alcoholic, The Waco Kid (Gene Wilder). Working together they devise several schemes to foil plans for a monopolized take-over of the local economy, all while slowly gaining trust with the people.The fourth wall is broken several times over the course of the movie, one time near the end as been recorded in the annals of film history as the most outrageous Hollywood spoof of the seventies. It reminds me of an interview with John Cleese of Monty Python fame who divulged that the troupe could never find a good way to end their skits so they just smash-cut to the next scene. Mel Brooks obviously didn't want to end his movie in a clich\u00e9 way so he ended it with a similar tact only with much more mayhem.As I have grown to love and appreciate westerns I have grown to appreciate Blazing Saddles more and more. There are subtle references to Shane (1953), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Stagecoach (1939) and of course Destry Rides Again (1939) all of which are syncopated and propped up against references to Count Basie and Cole Porter. John Wayne was even approached to play a small role in the film but he refused saying it was too vulgar; he then told Brooks \"...but I'll be the first to see it.\"Those of the younger fold were probably introduced to Mel Brooks through Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995); that's if they have been introduced to his genius at all. I try not to be a golden age thinker but I can't help but feel sad for those likely to miss out. From The Producers (1967) to Broadway's The Producers, Mel Brooks is no doubt one of the funniest, most original writers, directors and performers to ever exist. If you have not been introduced to his works check them out before its too late.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Mel Brooks has made so many great movies and a few misses. \"Young Frankenstein\" is his best, but \"Space Balls\" is downright boring in spots! My personal underrated favorite is \"Men in Tights.\" Also \"To Be or Not to Be\" is a brilliant remake and I love both versions of \"The Producers\". So many classics I haven't even mentioned. Originally written by and for Richard Pryor, Cleavon Little plays Sheriff \"Black Bart\" to the hilt. Gene Wilder is surprisingly likable as \"The Waco Kid\". Madeline Kahn's performance almost won her an Oscar! Look for David Huddleston (best known as \"Santa Claus\") and Harvey Korman as Heddley Lemarr. Alex Karas is Mongo! Superb. Slim Pickens plays the stereotypical cowboy parody-of-himself to new comical heights. Ever notice how stupid the \"White People\" are in this film? It satirizes every cliche ever filmed. The townspeople are all inbred and all named \"Johnson\". Hilarious! Several thoughts as I watch this for the 60th time (or more): What's with the cows running through every scene? Far too much use of the \"N Word\" for my taste. I never liked the ending that much but the pie fight in the WB Commissary is still a riot. I wish they had stayed in the Old West instead of the modern ending, which breaks through \"the 4th wall,\" driving off the set in a 1974 Cadillac. One of the funniest, irrelevant, and most ridiculous movies of all time. Not for the easily offended, as it insults everybody, regardless of race or religion! Rated \"X\" in 1974 for it's salty language. Probably could not be made today for tons of reasons. Madelyn Kahn and Alex Karas both should have won Oscars for their hilarious performances! Does anyone notice how pretty Madelyn Kahn actually is? She has great legs! (I actually wore out the (ancient) VHS tape and had to buy a disc!)",

I saw it some thirty years ago and then again last night and I laughed more or less in the same places and shrugged and sighed in more or less the same places. Brooks is similar to the early Woody Allen in that his movies are a string of one-liners a la Neil Simon also but the difference is that both Brooks and Simon are using one-liners to punctuate a plot (Simon) or plot-of-sorts (Brooks) whilst in Allen's case the early movies were a string of one-liners in search of a plot. In this case Brooks has taken every clich\u00e9 in the 'western' canon and then p****d all over it and added the odd surreal touch. For example Madelein Kahn's brilliant send-up of Marlene Dietrich is authentic in all but the 'adult' lyric; it's set in a saloon, much like the one in Destry Rides Again, saloons employed singers so what's the beef. Nothing serious it's just that the sequence has little or nothing to do with what's going on. On the other hand the brilliant scene of the Count Basie orchestra playing one of their signature hits, April In Paris in the middle of East Jesus with no audience is pure surreal.It's let down a tad by the Pirandello-type ending but then how else could you end something like this. Still highly watchable.",

I mean the film has been set in 1875 or something and then goes onto the Warner Brothers studios backlot.

            "content": "Blazing Saddles is a movie which, if you have never seen it, definitely has a reputation that precedes it. That reputation indicates that this is one of the funniest movies of all time. When you finally get around to watching the movie you find the movie's reputation unfortunately exceeds its actual content. This movie is purported to be a lot funnier than it really is. So watching the movie can be a bit of a letdown. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie though. It may not be one of the funniest movies ever but it's funny enough. Mel Brooks tosses anything and everything into the comedy mix in this one. Some of it doesn't work, much of it is just passable. But there are those moments of comic genius sprinkled throughout. It is a movie of comedic bits and pieces with the scattered pieces that work brilliantly enough to make the movie a success.In a movie like this the plot is almost besides the point but the story revolves around an Old West town in 1874 which gets a new sheriff. The new sheriff is black. The townspeople are horrified. Comedy ensues. That comedy is largely hit and miss, the movie never really manages to sustain the laughs for any great length of time. All the performers do admirable jobs with what they're asked to do. But a lot of what they're asked to do just doesn't end up being as funny as you would hope. Madeline Kahn is a prime example. Her character of singing seductress Lili von Shtupp has great potential and Kahn performs beautifully. But her big song falls well short of Springtime for Hitler-style genius. Kahn gives it her all but it's just not funny enough. If you're waiting for the big laughs you'll be waiting a while but they finally do come in an ending in which Brooks sends his movie careening wildly off the rails. The ending is bizarre and outrageous and preposterous and pretty much perfect. With this ending Brooks went for broke and it worked. There are a whole lot of laughs crammed into those final few minutes. The movie may have been just a touch disappointing most of the way but Blazing Saddles definitely leaves you laughing in the end. Maybe the movie doesn't match its reputation but there's enough good stuff here to keep you satisfied.",

            "content": "Blazing Saddles (1974) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline is a classic western spoof where a corrupt politician looks to appoint a new sheriff after his long time friend who was sheriff dies. The politician wishes to continue to have free reign over his town without pushback from the new sheriff so he hires a black sheriff who he thinks will just be happy to have the job. Unfortunately for the politician the new sheriff takes his job seriously and becomes a worthy adversary.This movie is directed by and stars Mel Brooks (Spaceballs) and also stars Cleavon Little (Vanishing Point), Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), Slim Pickens (1941), Madeline Kahn (Paper Moon), George Furth (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and David Huddleston (The Big Lebowski).This is a film that I believe would be pretty hard to make and release today. The stereotypes depicted are pretty intense, both of African Americans and how mentally incompetent the South is. It was entertaining and Little and Wilder are excellent. Mongo was a great character and I enjoyed Brooks random behaviors. The final shootout was a perfect climax and fun sequence and the soundtrack is also perfectly selected.While this isn't Brooks best movie, it is worthwhile and an absolute must see. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",

            "content": "While Mel Brooks's western spoof, \"Blazing Saddles,\" retains some hilarious moments and delicious performances, the stereotypes and racial epithets are badly outdated. Westerns produced since 1974 have illustrated the place that African-Americans played in the old west. Thus, the over-the-top reactions of an all-white town facing the appointment of a black sheriff will strike many as quaint and others as ridiculous. The repetitive use of the \"N\" word is difficult for modern audiences to hear, and many viewers will flinch in embarrassment each time it is uttered. The sight of an elderly woman meeting up with the sheriff and spitting out \"Up Yours N*****\" is patently offensive. While Brooks does not stereotype the film's African-Americans, he has no qualms about deriding Gay Americans. Besides a bevy of Gay insults thrown around during the film, the ending features a bevy of dancing queens who mince and answer to \"Let's Go Girls!\" Perhaps that was funny in 1974, but that attitude is way out of date in the era of \"Brokeback Mountain.\"Does \"Blazing Saddles\" have any redeeming values left? Yes, there are enough bright spots to outshine the bad. Madeline Kahn as the Marlene-Dietrich-like saloon singer, who is brought in to seduce the sheriff, provides a jewel of a performance. Harvey Korman is nearly as good as Hedley Lamarr, who strives to be the Boris Badanov of the film. The famous campfire bean-eating scene is classic, the cowboys singing \"De Camptown Ladies\" is a hoot, and Kahn's seduction of the sheriff in the dark is hilarious. While the title song was intended as a parody, as sung by Frankie Laine it ranks with some of the best western themes, many of which Laine also crooned.Unfortunately, the film begins as a fine western spoof and ends in a surreal mess. When \"Blazing Saddles\" concentrates on being an affectionate send-up of the western genre, the film is on solid ground. If he had remained focused, Brooks and company might have turned in a parody as fine as the subsequent \"Young Frankenstein,\" arguably the best movie genre spoof ever. Unfortunately, the writers seem to have run out of ideas, and a surreal aspect sets in towards the end that destroys the internal logic of the film and breaks through the barrier between 1874 and the present. However, if viewers can get beyond the epithets and stereotyping, there is enough hilarity to sustain at least two viewings, the minimum needed to catch all of the throwaway lines and visual jokes.",

            "content": "It's amazing how many more laughs are to be found in an old five-minute SNL sketch than in this 93-minute piece of sludge. Yes, that's right, it's only 93 minutes long, but if you make the mistake of checking this one out, you'll feel like it's a 3 hour yawnfest. In fact, the early scene with the characters caught in quicksand will sum up your viewing experience: an imprisonment in a slimy, stolid muck and the struggle to pull your way through it.Of course, a big part of the problem is that most of the would-be jokes simply aren't funny. I'm amazed that a movie like this received the critical praise that it has. Comedy can be so much more than what \"Blazing Saddles\" throws on the screen. I think that some of the critics and award-peddlers might have been tricked into applauding the film because, unlike many comedies, it makes an attempt to examine --- or rather, to incorporate the issue of racism into its humor. Thus, some may be convinced that the movie exhibits intelligence by trying to deal with a \"serious\" theme, but any social statement it musters is neither solid nor accurate. Much of the movie's humor is based on the unrealistic supposition that all white inhabitants of the southwest were crass, easily-duped white supremacist WASPs who used racial slurs out of habit and detested blacks. Racism is a difficult subject to form comedy from, and here the concept is beaten over the viewer's head. The jokes are shouted out with no subtlety or wit, as if heavy-handedness makes them clever or socially perceptive. And as a source of humor, it wears out quickly, for that matter. The director Mel Brooks thinks it's funny to give all the white racists the generic name of \"Johnson.\" Har har. Never mind the fact that the US president who fought for black civil rights and appointed the first black Supreme Court justice was a white Texan named Johnson.It's true that some of the jokes could have worked, but the movie has such a poor sense of pacing that it fails to build anything resembling comic mood or momentum. You could call it dull, unappealing, even unimaginative. And it seems like Brooks was very determined to mug for the camera and bore the viewer during his lengthy on-screen appearances. His face kind of resembles Don Adams from \"Get Smart,\" but when it comes to being funny, make no mistake, Don Adams he ain't.While trying to stay awake around the 40-minute mark, I said to myself, \"OK, well, Gene Wilder should be showing up soon. He can be funny sometimes.\" But his presence is barely memorable at best. After Wilder delivers a slurred speech or two, the film introduces the quick-handedness of Wilder's gun-slinging character, which proves to be the film's only gag that is remotely funny and interesting. Alas, this provides but a minute or two of material. The writers seemed to have trouble finding a purpose for him, and so Wilder inexplicably spends most of the movie hanging around Cleavon Little's office. Instead of doing comedy, he is left to recite long stretches of forgettable dialogue.Let's see, what other \"comedy\" does the movie offer? There are the ho-hum attempts to recreate Monty Python-style absurd humor, especially at the end. Simply flat compared to what those British boys have done, and not enough to lift this picture out of the mud. And no discussion of the movie can ignore the bulk of the material, the continuous vein of low-brow, puerile rubbish not worth anyone's time. Another IMDb reviewer or two have labeled it \"seventh grade\" stuff. Well, I even bet there are a number of 7th Graders who would feel that this humor is beneath them. (That is, if they managed to sit through all the other boring scenes.) I am perplexed that such dreck is being held up by some critics as high cinema.Unless you feel it is absolutely essential for you to hear Slim Pickens spouting the S-word, skip this one.",

            "content": "It's been 20 years since I last watched this. Though I can't say I recall why, I do recall that I didn't care for this at all the first time through; I just didn't think it was funny. After two decades it was high time to give it another try, and you know what? It's better than I remembered! With age comes wisdom, and whatever my misgivings were in the past, I have a much better appreciation, now, of this classic. I still think 'Blazing saddles' is far from perfect, and I'm in no rush to watch it again - I'm of the mind that among Mel Brooks' many classics, this is a rather mixed bag. If nothing else, though, I at least am at last able to acknowledge its worth.In the most fundamental elements of film-making, it's pretty strong. The costume design looks fantastic, as does the set design and decoration. I like the stunts, and the scene writing that balances enjoyable western action with considerable silliness. The narrative itself is overall quite solid, capably honoring the storytelling traditions of the genre it parodies. And the cast is a true joy, clearly reveling in the outlandish roles and scenarios. Above all star Cleavon Little is a gem, bringing swell self-aware levity to atypical western hero Bart, yet also gratifying poise and strength of personality. There's a great slew of accomplished players and character actors among his co-stars, all of whom add so much to the fun here - but more so than others, I must give high commendations to Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn, both heartily embracing the nonsense as antagonist Hedley Lamarr and sultry Lili Von Sht\u00fcpp, respectively.Of course, 'Blazing saddles' bears all the hallmarks of a Brooks feature. We're treated to sight gags, wordplay and one-liners, exaggerated characters and situations, sex jokes and innuendo, upended expectations, sundering of the fourth wall, references and anachronisms, and physical comedy. At its best the picture is wonderfully entertaining, earning strong laughs - and don't get me wrong: I must emphasize, this is a good time! However, for all that which is done well, and all the amusement it provides, it's also inconsistent. Some bits linger too long, including even the opening scene, while others are plainly overdone - and the latter quality describes the climactic sequence in particular. The ending makes a hard turn from satire to a farce so wild as to be distinctly cartoonish, rather reminding me of the ludicrous finale of 1967's 'Casino Royale.' Sure, so it is with more than a few comedies generally, and Brooks films specifically, but here it's altogether a tad too over the top. Even at that, in my opinion the first and last 20 minutes of the movie carry the bulk of the value in the viewing experience; while there's some dependable cleverness, the middle portion drags significantly. Lackadaisical pacing is somewhat a problem throughout, but most so in the soft midsection, where the humor simply isn't sufficient to compensate.It's also important to note prominent themes in the writing, and the dialogue in particular. This is a feature bursting with substantial racism forefront in the narrative, with additional classism and sexism. True, these are all plainly mocked in the course of events, but all the same, the notions are so heavily accentuated as to nonetheless be distasteful. Still, it's the ups and downs of the comedy that does the most to weaken the picture at large. This is a title that struggles with balance: at times a bit dull, at times excessive; at times trotting along steadily, at others mired in quicksand. A tighter screenplay, and possibly a shorter one, would have gone a long way.Regardless, this is adequately entertaining, and satisfying. My opinion has improved from what it once was, and I'm genuinely glad to have revisited the classic after so long. Fair enough - there's an admiring audience for the picture, and I'm just not it. But with that, though I'd decline to suggest 'Blazing saddles' is an essential slice of cinema, it's deserving enough if one comes across it, and naturally most recommendable for Brooks fans.",

If you watch it as a cartoon, the weirdness of the film will thus be received much better.Blazing Saddles is a Western comedy about a black sheriff. It is set in the Wild West but treats its time an place setting very loosely. One of the characters introduced early on is an executioner that is clad in chain mail in a cowl, with a big axe behind him. It tends to break the 4th wall as well...once literally.It is quite funny, and also really not funny. It has a lot of weird childish and dumb jokes that really miss as well as a lot of nonsensical slapstick, but it also has a lot of cute and sometimes outright brilliant stuff. It throws enough of them and a fast enough pace to let you pick and choose. Overall the movie is witty and enjoyable enough. Also, it is SUCH A WELCOME CHANGE from the modern comedies that use blunt gross extremes or dumb spoofs instead of actual comedy. The comedy is direct and a bit dark, racism and rape jokes included of course. I am glad someone had the guts in 1974. I know I just earlier mentioned that it was different from the modern gross comedies, and I maintain that. This humour works. It has effort put into it and does not go overboard.Frankly, this may not seem a favorable comparison to some, but Blazing Saddles is like a good episode of Family Guy. Unlike Family Guy, this film has a really good story to it. It is competently shot and has a smooth progression in scenes.Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder have really good chemistry as the two main characters. Gene Wilder is \u0085Gene Wilder.This movie does not deserve as much praise for all the stupidity it brings to the table, but it is really cute and has a lot of heart.

But Cleavon Little was obviously quite happy to appear in it and hopefully accepted the humour for what it was.

For me, one of the best lines in the movie has to be: \"We'll give some land to the niggers and the chinks - but we don't want the Irish!\" but by far and away the funniest has to be the old lady who replies to Sheriff Bart's friendly greeting with \"Up your's nigger.\" I think people have to take on trust that the film's primary aim was to amuse, to gently ridicule, but certainly not to offend.

After many means of violence as intimidation don't work,they opt to go with planting a black sheriff from one of their cheap labor,believing the townies will refuse to obey the new sheriff and proceed to kill him and themselves,if not flat out abandon the town. What they don't count on is the man they pick for the job,a sly,wisecracking dude named BArt(Cleavon Little,who uses an almost Bugs Bunny-like ease in playing the part),is a lot more clever and willing to turn the situation to his own advantage. With the help of a boozy yet still sharp gunman named Jim(Gene Wilder,slow talking' and dry as a bone but just fine here),and Bart's ability to convince the town folk that their real enemy is LaMarr,they are able to steadily turn the tables on their corrupt overlords.With great turns by Alex KArras(still fresh off his football career,playing a mentally-challenged thug named Mongo who's as strong as he is stupid),John Hillerman(as one of the town elders,HOward Johnson,one of the many Johnsons that inhabit the village),Mel Brooks himself(as both the absent-minded and easily-rooked governor AND a wise Indian chief) and Madeline Kahn(a Brooks favorite as Lily Von Schtupp,the enticing,Marlena Dietrich-like chanteuse)and even a well-placed cameo by Dom DeLuise,this movie stands up pretty well over the test of time. Co-scripted by Richard Pryor and meant to add plenty of themes of parodying racism in movies,as well as the whole OAter genre itself,this film may seem a little less eyebrow-raising as it might've in 1974,it STILL is able to illicit raw laughs and keep to its message. Mr.Brooks has directed,starred,co-written and produced many television shows and movies in his day. This,along with Young Frankenstein,represent perhaps the most fertile and lasting parts to his legacy. A must-watch for the lover of the crass comedy that doesn't mind breaking all sorts of dimensions and standards.",

I saw this film in a theater at the age of 9,but don't worry, I was not influenced at all by the foul language.Mel Brooks is an absolute master of taking a particular genre,studying how films within that genre are made,and using that to poke a little fun at it.He used typical cinematography from the western genre to pull off this parody,with terrific results.I would not recommend children be allowed to view this,because, as I said,the language does get very raw,and I know children can be very easily influenced,even though I was not.There is very bold use of the \"N\" word throughout this film,which may offend some,but I truly feel that the movie makes fun of the people using the word,which should make it tolerable if you keep this in mind.All in all,this movie is a fun ride from start to finish.",

Best remembered today for its infamous \"farting scene,\" the film also boasts many other humorous sequences - such as Madeline Kahn's dance and just about any scene with Brooks or Gene Wilder.Cleavon Little, Wilder, Brooks, Kahn and Slim Pickens head an all-star cast about a corrupt town sheriff who appoints a black man to be sheriff in order to ruin the reputation of the area. The black sheriff actually winds up becoming far more respected than anyone would have imagined and becomes the politician's enemy.This is not as laugh-out-loud funny as Brooks' \"Spaceballs\" but, like \"Young Frankenstein,\" is better structured. It is a classic comedy, one of Brooks' finest. Apart from satirizing racism and western movies, it takes a stab at just about everything in sight.\"Blazing Saddles\" may disappoint some people who are under the impression that it is regarded as the \"best\" comedy of all-time, but if you approach it level-headed you'll find it a rewarding and unique comedic experience.",

It satirizes American western films and racism.The plot is wild and has many (intentional) holes. The comedy takes priority over the plot, which isn't a bad thing. A frontier town is raided by bandits and the sheriff is slain in a hilarious sequence with custom vocal music. The government appoints a replacement, the black sheriff Bart. Bart believes that he was sent to protect the town, but in reality the government chose him (being black) to scare away the townspeople to clear the area for a railroad. The town hesitantly accepts him. Bart and his assistant Jim (the Waco Kid) then protect the town from the government's ploys. It culminates in an epic brawl.The acting is good, although most of the characters are simply caricatures. Gene Wilder (as Jim) and Harvey Korman (as the government official Hedley Lamarr, mastermind behind the railroad plans) give the best performances. The small roles by Mel Brooks himself are much appreciated as well.Blazing Saddles is one of the best comedies of its decade. I enjoyed Young Frankenstein a little more, but together they make a brilliant combo from Mel Brooks. If you like comedies, don't miss this classic.",

One memory is one New Years Eve when I was about ten where I stayed up late, intentionally so that i could set a video recorder to tape \"Young Frankenstein\". With both that film, \"Silent Movie\" and \"Blazing Saddles\" I was hooked on Mel Brooks. Whilst I would later fall in love with his original version of \"The Producers\", it was \"Blazing Saddles\" which originally caught my attention.In this film, Brooks has the brilliant Harvey Korman as Hedley Lamarr, state procurer and assistant to the General who decides that some land where the town of Rock Ridge is placed is going to be worth a lot and worthy of his attentions. As a way of attempting to scare the owners off the land, Lamarr sends Cleavon Little's Bart to the town as Sheriff. As America's first black Sheriff, Bart faces the challenge of winning the towns folk over and thwarting Hedley's evil plans.In this film, Brooks has created a masterpiece of comedic genius. Whilst times have changed since 1974, in particular the attitudes towards racism, \"Blazing Saddles\" remains fresh and funny. In characters like The Waco Kid and Lili Von Shtupp, Brooks gives Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and company a gift.It's hard to know what to say about this film really. Simply put, it's hilarious and amazing. The characters are brilliant, the lines are great, and ultimately nothing can really be criticised. Watch this film and enjoy it, I know I have.",

            "content": "*Very minor spoilers*A black railroad worker and a alcoholic gunfighter team up to rid a Western town of corruption.Hard to know where to start with a Mel Brooks satire of, not only everything western, but everything about film making and movies. It's sense of school yard fun and nothing-is-sacred shocked and titillated the 1970's audience - but today the crude lines and the farts come as standard.Many of the joke are re-workings of clich\u00e9s and Brooks (like a desperate prize fighter) is prepared to walk through anything to get in a blow. Despite his success a lot of his gags are like 1950's TV, only here there is no innuendo, they are merely thrown in your face as the camera closes in.Racism and clich\u00e9s about black men are naturally not left out - because Brooks, when has thought of a joke, cannot leave it out. In interviews he even seems to suggest that some are left in \"because they are bad.\"Brooks isn't a great comedian or a great film maker because all he can do is copy. In copying he actually takes aboard a lot of the tricks and devices that make the original work: Here, the bad guys get routed, the townsfolk realise that the black guy isn't so bad after all, that the washed up gunfighter is not washed-up after all, etc., etc.Madeline Kahn as a kind of Marlene Dietrich character is the real winner with Cleavon Little (standing in for an \"ill\" Richard Prior) not being able to do anything with his role other than keep a straight face. Brooks repertory company of glad-to-have-a-jobs come on to do their bits with the one-note Slim Pickens, perhaps, getting the best of it.The thing that strikes you is that Brooks is like a session musician, in that he can play anything that people ask of him, but ask him to come up with something of his own he falls down. There is enough gags that are funny - and enough of a plot to keep it going (just) - but you have to do more than steal little bit of other people's films to make a good product, even if it is a satire. However if you accept his limitations, then he is more than able to make movies that play well on late night television; especially after a hard day at the office.",

            "content": "I should first of say that I've never been a particularly big fan of Mel Brook's films, namely because they aren't funny, they are just silly, and this movie is a case in point. The thing is that most of the humour deals with anachronism, and there just really doesn't seem to be anything all that funny with the anachronisms that are in this film. Actually, a lot of the jokes just seem to be quite stupid - such as the scene where they are hanging a guy sitting on his horse.Mind you, this film is a little uncomfortable namely because on the face of it it comes across as being incredibly racist, particularly with the use of the N-word, but it does raise the question as to whether it actually is racist, or is it just highlighting the racist underpinnings of Hollywood. Personally, I suspect it is actually the second because the sheriff is not only the hero of the film, but he actually has to confront the fact that he lives in a racist world, and Brooks does a great job of exposing us to this through the use of comedy.I guess the fact that this film is so silly allows Brooks to get away with a lot of the things that he does - for instance having the Indian Chief speaking Yiddish, which is a criticism of the fact that Hollywood, in the past, has basically white washed the Indians. In fact, he is bringing up an issue that has tainted Indian culture for hundreds of years, particularly since many of the western films portrayed them as being the bad guys. The fact that they don't attack the stragglers because they are black is a subtle (or even not so subtle) suggestion, that it was the whites that are the problem.In fact, we also notice that the people who treat the African-Americans badly are the bad guys, and the townsfolk, and Brooks pretty clearly paints the image of the townsfolk as being stupid right from the getgo. However, when he manages to defeat Mungo, they all begin to change their tune. Further, when they manage to defeat the bad guys, it is with the help of the minorities working on the railway.The two things that stand out from this film though is the scene where Mungo punches out a horse with one punch, and the fact that at the end of the film, the fight spills out from the set of the Western and into other studios, as well as to the Chinese Theatre that makes an appearance in a lot of other films.Sure, it is a classic film, and it is also a cult film, but to be honest, I still didn't find it all that funny. However, what I do appreciate is how Brooks does address racism in the film industry in a way that people can appreciate.",

The film is jam-packed with racially insensitive humor (I think it might be impossible to count how many times the 'n' word is used in the film), but it is freakin' hysterical. Written by Richard Pryor and Mel Brooks (among others), 'Blazing Saddles' boasts an ingenious script filled with lots of laughs. Mel Brooks plays both the cross-eyed mayor and an Indian chief, while Oscar nominee Madeline Kahn is great as Lily, who finds out that the myth about slave folk is true. I recommend this to anyone willing to excuse the out-dated humor. Definitely a comedic classic! Grade: B+",

Let me put it this way, even in a very broad parody like this, the story remains important.  Not nearly as important as it would be in a real (i.e., \"straight\") Western, but not utterly disposable either.  The story is a loose (very loose) framework of characters, motivations, and events, within which the comedy can occur.  In a comedy of this type, there is a lot of room to stretch the story (anachronisms, for instance).  But it can't be stretched forever.  The ending goes too far, and falls flat as a result.  But, watch it at least that far, anyway, and then turn it off.  I do the same thing with \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\".",

No matter how many times I watch it, it will always get a hearty laugh out of me. Even the liberal use of the \"N\" word makes me chuckle, not because racism is funny, but because it is a word that is taboo nowadays and just not used very often.I'd like to comment a bit on the racial slurs herein. It is obviously done tongue-in-cheek and never comes across as mean spirited, being more of a satire highlighting the stupidity of racism. Ironically, the only truly likable characters in the movie are black, with the exception of the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder). The epithets are certainly not reserved for one racial group, but are liberally dispersed amongst Asians, Latinos, American Indians, and Irish, not to mention homosexuals. It should be also noted that stereotypes such as the stupid cowboy and greedy railroad men are ever present as well.In the end, Blazing Saddles is a very silly, yet clever comedy/musical that has stood the test of time. Even the soundtrack is original and great. Many of the actors involved have either passed away or are now in the twilight of their lives, and this is a glimpse into many of them at the peaks of their careers. I will admit that this movie is not for everyone, and it is not without some flaws. But the whole really shines through and will forever remain one of my favorite comedies.",

If that isn't true, he could have just asked hadn't they ever seen Blazing Saddles when journalists kept probing him on the use of the word N****r! There are many classics that I love from this era (late sixties and early to mid-seventies) and comedies especially. Today, if you want to be cutting edge, you have to attack what makes people uncomfortable. Back then if you wanted to be cutting edge, you made fun of the worst, most despicable and ignorant that people could be. But you did it with immense observational humour to lampoon the worst of human nature.I love M*A*S*H, Catch-22 and especially Blazing Saddles. These are three films that really get under your skin as comedies, all for different reasons, but they share the same quick wit and jaw dropping slapstick comedy that have more a theatrical charm that cinema doesn't often have the privilege of witnessing.To think that before the comedy partnership of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor there was Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little. This is a partnership made in comedy heaven and yet Blazing Saddles is made of comedy partnerships all around with an excellent cast.Getting down to brass tacks, Blazing Saddles is an outlandish western comedy from Mel Brooks (which says it all) and possibly his best. Centered around the introduction of slave Bart (Little) as the new Sheriff of a western town, at the suggestion of the very man trying to destroy it, he teams up with Jim aka Waco Kid (Wilder) to stand up for that very town, which is very big on despicably out and proud racism.What makes that okay? It's not okay. It's quite dismaying the first few times and those that said the same about Django should have seen this first, came out of their protective shell and realised that it was nothing new.Blazing Saddles pokes insurmountable fun at the calibre of racist folk and Cleavon Little is both hugely charismatic and hilarious as Sheriff Bart, in comparison. Not surprisingly, he goes on to win the people's hearts and minds, despite the fact it doesn't stop them being big dumb and very possibly inbred racists.That's the charm of this movie. It doesn't preach that you have to change. It gives up on the possibility of change and settles for knowing that morons will never change. That's the truth and we should accept it, because nothing's worse than a moron pretending to be anything but a moron, right?

I can't really complain since I do enjoy the results.One of the early interesting things about this film to me is that, as a genre parody, it functions as a Western pretty straight forwardly. The elements range from typical Western to completely zany, but the story underlying it all is pretty straight forward small people against land grabber stuff that's been present since John Ford made Straight Shooting in 1917. A nefarious Attorney General of an unnamed western state wants to scoop up soon to be valuable land because of a railroad at minimal cost by driving out the populace of the small town of Rock Ridge and buying the land from under them. The difference is that the Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) is a loquacious ham who needs his green ducky in the bath, his chief henchman Taggart (Slim Pickens) is an amusing idiot, the governor Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) is a cross-eyed moron, and the plan involves sending a black sheriff, Bart (Cleavon Little) to help drive the people out purely because he's black.The comedy comes from a wide mixture of sources, feeling more like what one might expect from the writer of a sketch comedy show than what Brooks had previously delivered in his first two films. There are plays on genre convention, like everyone in the town being named Johnson, mixed with anachronistic flare like the local executioner being dressed as a medieval executioner (complete with outrageous arm movements back and forth). It's mostly a combination of heightened western elements with crazy out of left field additions that combine in unexpected ways, always for laughs as the intentions.I have a small issue, though, and that's for the first two-thirds of the film its mostly just amusing. Maybe this is familiarity breeding some level of numbness to the comedic antics since I've seen the film so many times, but I mostly grin through the comedy as presented through most of the film instead of laugh. What's left after that? The story of a black man coming to a racist little town and winning them over. Because Brooks and his cowriters are smart enough to understand that story comes first, that story works first and foremost (though a joke that amounts to a story beat, Bart taking himself hostage, has always felt like an odd workaround that never quite worked). It's not saying anything too deep beyond \"racism is bad\" (with perhaps a bit of \"the powerful try to pit people against each other\" thrown in for good measure), but it's solidly built.Bart gains a sidekick in the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), a former gunslinger who turned in his guns for a whiskey bottle when something tragic happened to him a couple of years before, and I think the scene where the Kid tells his story is one of the best examples of turning genre convention upside down in the film. The story he tells, being the fastest gun in the world and attracting every thrill seeker to fight him, feels straight from a Randolph Scott western, but it's capped by an outrageous ending (getting shot in the butt by a six-year-old kid) that provides the punch line on what we think we know.Another source of comedy is the music. From the opening title song, written by Brooks and sung by Frankie Laine, to \"The Ballad of Rock Ridge\" that amusingly becomes a sung hymn by the characters in church (complete with expletive to end it) and \"I'm Tired,\" performed by Madeleine Kahn as the Marlene Dietrich inspired Lili Von Shtupp (probably the funniest thing in the movie up until the big finale), Brooks used music to help both ground the film in the conventions and feel of the genre while also finding more examples for comedy along the way.Now, the ending. In Brooks' two previous films, he could have gone for increased insanity to close out his pictures, but he chose some kind of sweet and sad catharsis. Here, he goes the One, Two, Three route of increasing insanity until its ending. There's no attempt at any kind of emotional denouement. He knows exactly what kind of anarchic ending he wants, and he delivers in spades with a big showdown on the streets of Rock Ridge between the good guys and the bad guys spilling over into the Warner Brothers lot, the commissary (where an actor playing Hitler in another movie just salutes on top of a counter while everyone fights below), and eventually to a theater down the street where Hedy (sorry, Hedley) watches the end of the movie he's in where Bart rides up to the theater on his horse for the final showdown. This is pure insanity, and I love it.I'm willing to believe that I've simply become too close to the film for the comedy to have that kind of shock value a lot of it needs for the humor to work. I'm still amused by large portions of the first 2/3 of the film, consistently smiling, but the film doesn't really become hilarious to me until its finale. And hilarious I do find that ending.The movie is anchored by Cleavon Little's performance as Bart, playing the cool, urban Richard Pryor stand-in as a counterpoint to the rustic surroundings he's in. Wilder is largely quiet as the Waco Kid, playing a man of few words, especially once he decides to take up his guns again, a markedly different performance from the neurotic Leo Bloom in The Producers. The supporting cast is responsible for a lot of laughs on their own, from Slim Pickens just generally being himself to the denizens of Rock Ridge who end up playing up their stereotypes very well, and even Alex Karras as Mongo, the surprisingly thoughtful brute sent to destroy Bart who ends up on his side.Funny, backed by solid, basic storytelling, and ending with a riotous conclusion that just embraces comedic anarchy, Blazing Saddles is still a very fun trip into the Old West.",

Comedy genius Mel Brooks was at work in 1974 creating a classic that has more than withstood the test of time. Starring Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, and Harvey Korman, Blazing Saddles brought an all-star cast together with some of the greatest comedic writing to result in a film that is still shared over 40 years after its release. Gene Wilder had a brilliant year in 1974, and Blazing Saddles was part of that.The year is 1874, the rules of the Old West still rule the country, and Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) needs to find a way to get a whole town out of his way in order to build a new railroad track. After his first attempt to evacuate the town fails, when he sends in henchmen to rid them, he must come up with a plan B. The town then demands a new sheriff to help keep them safe. Lamarr decides to send the town a black man to act as sheriff, an idea they are sure to disdain. Once the newly appointed sheriff, Bart (Cleavon Little) arrives, the town revolts just as expected. With the help of prisoner turned only friend, Jim (Gene Wilder) Bart's sophisticated ways and effective law keeping eventually win over the townsfolk as they see they are safe under Bart's reign. Becoming quite displeased that none of his plans are working, Lamarr then goes, with guns blazing towards sheriff Bart with his political muscle behind him. Blazing Saddles goes the distance to show how the west was really won in the 1870's. Mel Brooks, even at his zaniest is king of the spoof. This time spoofing a western, Brooks found his home at Rock Ridge. This movie was the best of Brooks and Wilder and an absolute gift to audiences everywhere that they shared their peaks with us. Another film that will make you wish they had collaborated more together, Blazing Saddles is one to watch again and again. The comedic writing was exceptional in this film. So many subtleties exist that there is bound to be something you missed the first time you saw it to pick up the next time you see it. That is the true beauty of this film that so much of its comedy is subtle. Any comedic writers/directors/actors of today should be required to watch Blazing Saddles; perhaps then, this generation would not be devoid of great comedy.",

Previously I had only seen this movie on network or syndicated television with a lot of edits and missing scenes. I'm glad I finally decided to watch it on DVD.The story isn't really important (about an old western town that finds itself in the path of a railroad development and in the way of some despicable politicos who try to destroy it) it just gives the brilliant Mel Brooks a long clothesline on which he can hang hundreds of old jokes, then-current jokes and timeless jokes. Mel Brooks is one of the best directors when it comes to tackling racism. He is so even handed that he can deliver a message when you don't even realize you are receiving one. It's the openness of overall acceptance that sits with you afterwards that is the final reward.When I watched this I wondered what had happened to a lot of the actors and actresses who appeared in it. I think only Gene Wilder is really still very active in making movies these days (or as of 2005). The cast was a tremendous collection of great comic and dramatic actors and actresses who all turned in wonderful performances, combining to turn a complicated storyline into an apparently seamless comic farce. I particularly liked seeing David Huddleston as Olson Johnson. He's a long time favorite supporting actor and, he too, is still playing some small roles (see the new \"The Producers\").My only complaints about \"Blazing Saddles\" are that some of the \"current\" references don't hold up too well after all this time and the ending gets a little complicated. I wish Mel Brooks could have kept the story in the same time line instead of resorting to \"return to reality\" ending he used.And it goes without saying, \"Blazing Saddles\" has the all time greatest farting scene in movie history.",

Dom DeLuise is also very funny as a prominent figure in the film's off-the-wall finale.

Surprisingly, it holds up because the quality of the writing is a cut above (the writers include Brooks, Richard Pryor and Andrew Bergman) and because it has something to say about racism in a very liberating, yet gentle, way--it's never offensive but still has a bite.

Brooks would later begin to take his film parodies far too seriously and, with the exception of his follow-up, `Young Frankenstein', delivered labored and flat comedies such as `Silent Movie' and `High Anxiety'. Here, however, his inspiration and passion for movies seem fresh, smart and fearless.

This also means that the aforementioned plot outline is not at focus nor does it boast of a very solid template story; rather, it takes a backseat to numerous detours and diversions. A hurricane of howlers, puns, in-jokes, deadpan deliveries, references and parodies substitute for the lack of story, and often brilliantly so.

He wields his supporting character aptly and well complements Cleavon Little.Yet for every token dynamic sing-and-dance number \u00e0 la Mel Brooks, the story tips over into fart-jokes territory. It is consistently shaky and uneven and that is just the level of humour \u0096 don't even get me started on the plot.

Moving away from the comedy side, it touches upon some highly salient issues like identity and racism but without becoming too serious in doing so (in fact, probably the opposite).

However, the great thing about Mel Brookes' comedies is that that any offensive suggestion is subtly implied and directed most pointedly back  at the offender rather than the victim in question.But I greatly suspect that if Mel tried to make this movie in today's politically correct climate the studios would take exception to the majority of its content and as a consequence would end up with a dull, lifeless, sanitized movie.As it is Blazing Saddles is a classic comedy, not just for Brookes but for comedy in general. Not only is it very witty with the rapid-fire one-liners, but there's also huge amounts of visual slap-stick and relatively subtle sexual innuendo that has a certain innocent but amusing charm about it. These days of course script writers would just use explicit language or even a sex act itself to get the point over which only goes to show how poor comedy writing has become.The ending is probably the film's weak spot. Brookes always seems to have problems with conclusions and BS is no exception. For even though the movie becomes more & more surreal the joke soon wears off and we're left unsatisfied as the two stars drive off into the sunset.But I suppose we can forgive Mel for such weaknesses. The other 95% of the movie is pure comic genius and will have you in pain with laughter, unless of course you take the jokes too seriously in which case you will be instantly offended and switch off.Mel hasn't really reproduced that kind of magic since, although I did like Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie & High Anxiety.

            "content": "I'm ashamed to say I only just saw BLAZING SADDLES for the first time last year. Until then, the only Mel Brooks I'd seen had been SPACEBALLS and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS (and even that one I hadn't watched since high school). I'd heard all the praise and I always knew I should have made time for it, but I was always so adverse to westerns that even the promise of Brooks' antics couldn't get me to give the movie a chance. Now I've got a new tolerance for the western genre and the Mel Brooks boxed set in my collection, so I've finally watched it. And, of course, I loved it. Of course I did. I was stupid to have put off watching it for as long as I did, and now I see that all the love heaped on the film is well earned. I don't know what I was expecting. The only scene I'd ever been familiar with prior was the infamous campfire scene so I'd always kind of assumed the movie was just 90 minutes of unrelenting toilet humor. I mean, sure, it's got that too but it's so much more. BLAZING SADDLES is part spoof, part social commentary with a heavy dose of Looney Tunes thrown in for good measure. It's the sort of movie that'll comment on how minorities were handled in the nineteenth century frontier and punctuate it with a full-blown pie fight. With YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, it's one of Brooks' best films.Long before Quentin Tarantino made us shift uncomfortably in our seats with his films' casual use of racial epithets, Brooks called attention to our country's squeaky-clean depiction of the frontier in movies with BLAZING SADDLES. His movie opens right up with an opening scene featuring African-American and Asian slaves building a railroad through the American west under the watchful eye of their white masters. We're hit right out of the gate with the first \"N-bomb\" and it's a little shocking at first, especially when the white cowpokes start mocking them with calls for Negro spirituals. The discomforting situation is immediately defused when it's made apparent Brooks intends that the racists themselves are going to be the fools and laughingstocks. We're shown that, yes, the movie is going to have some racial content but we're not to be concerned because those hurling the insults are either evil (Taggart and his posse) or ignorant (the townsfolk of Rock Ridge). And it all culminates in people of all colors and creeds coming together under the leadership of their new (black) sheriff Bart (Cleavon Little) to dispatch the evil horde of \"rustlers, cut throats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, halfwits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, conmen, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswogglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, a**-kickers, s***-kickers and Methodists\" who've come to run them out of their peaceful town. See, Brooks has ingrained his film with a positive, progressive commentary and seasoned it with fart jokes.Well, one fart joke anyway. The rest is Brooks' usual brand of cartoonish gags and zaniness. He's assembled a knockout comedy cast including Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, and of course Little as our hero Bart. There are more memorable moments (Bart's arrival in Rock Ridge), lines of dialogue (Bart to KKK thugs: \"Where the white women at?\"), and character quirks (Kahn's Lili Von Shtupp) in this movie than most other comedies I've seen. There isn't a whole lot to say in regards to a movie like BLAZING SADDLES without going into a fan rant about how much I enjoyed this gag or that. Brooks films are pretty simple in that, if you've enjoyed his other films, you're bound to enjoy this one because it's one of his best. I might even consider it his top piece of work but YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has lodged itself in my mind deeper and deeper with every time I've watched it. I guess I would say BLAZING SADDLES is Brooks' funniest film whereas YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is his best-constructed film. It's also from an era where movies, especially comedies, didn't overstay their welcomes; it's a quick ninety-minute runtime. You're in and out and laughing your head off in no time at all. Plus, as with most of Brooks' work, the more you watch it, the more funny stuff you're bound to notice in the background that you might've missed in the last viewing because you were still laughing at some other bit.",

This may be his best (it's a toss-up between this and \"Young Frankenstein\")! Cleavon Little stars as \"Black Bart\" a black ex-slave who becomes the sheriff of a small western town... and has to combat their prejudices... as well as the evil Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) who wants to take over the town... after he drives all the people out. This movie is a send-up of every western movie ever made... hundreds of clich\u00e9s are mercilessly made fun of. Very, very rude and crude at times... the movie is nonetheless hysterically funny at times. It may seem less shocking today than it did 30 years ago... but the famed \"campfire scene\" still packs a wallop. The extremely un-PC humour would probably never be allowed in a mainstream movie nowadays (numerous uses of the infamous N-word)... but it's important to note that it's use is not *condoned*... in fact, the movie is a pointed attack against the ignorant and the bigoted who use it so casually. An amazing cast keeps the jokes and slapstick coming non-stop... Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickins, Mel Brooks, Alex Karass, Dom DeLuise and the incomparable Gene Wilder (who did his best work under Mel Brooks' direction.) I could rattle off a half dozen classic funny lines but why deprive those who have not yet seen the movie from discovering them on their own?",

            "content": "That is my favorite line from this movie by the way. Blazing Saddles is ridicules, over the top, satirical comedy at its finest. I've grown to appreciate it more as time has gone on for me. Mel Brooks could be the greatest comedy director of all time and his resume speaks for itself. While I feel that Young Frankenstein is a better film, Blazing Saddles is probably a close second. The western genre was ripe for a good parody. All of the classic western tropes and promptly skewered here.Like most great satires, it pokes fun at everyone. But of course its main target is the absurdity of racism and prejudice. How Hollywood has used stereotypes over the years. Of course the film makes fun of these stereotypes by increasing them to the highest power. By doing this we see how stupid and outrageous these stereotypes truly are. Never thought you'd get a thought provoking message in a Mel Brooks film did you? Of course, the primary focus of the movie is to make you laugh.Black Bart must conquer fear and hate to save his small town from greedy land owners. Yes, there's a lot of nasty and outdated words here, but they are used to make a point and not for the sake of it. Some might be offended and that's okay. Everyone has different sensitivities and I won't mock them like some people do. Just know that it's not meant to be offensive. It's meant to be provocative and start discussion, while also being hilarious.\nThe film is full of great comic moments that hold up very well today. To be fair not every joke is a hit, but when it's a hit, it's a damn good one. Clevon Little sadly didn't do to much outside of this movie. Can you imagine anyone else in this part? He's brilliant. Great combo of funny, with enough seriousness to be a believable protagonist. Brooks also has a memorable part. And of course there's the late great Gene Wilder. Such a gifted comedian. Madeline Khan is also fantastic. Loved every moment she was on screen. Yet another great talent lost far to early.I could say the usual talking point of \"this movie couldn't be made today because of \"blah blah blah*insert generic PC reference* something irrelevant blah blah\". But that's overdone, boring and almost insulting to this great film. Let me leave you with this. If you want an edgier comedy that has something to say to it's audience, but never forgets its primary mission to makes its audience laugh, then Blazing Saddles is the comedy for you. Also, you'll be singing that theme song all day long!",

He is best behind the camera. As I said before most of the jokes fall flat and some of the actors deserved better. Young Frankenstien also came out the same year and was better and funnier. Even Airplane was a million times better and I laughed more at that one than Blazing Saddles. Airplane ages better. I couldn't believe Blazing Saddles ranked higher than Airplane.

Gene Wilder and CLeavon Little are also great in the movie.But all this being said, I do think the movie feels uneven, some parts made me really laugh but most of it just didn't quite do it for me but nevertheless I will still say Blazing Saddles is a good comedy, but it doesn't deserve the status it has.",

While this is a spoof of the western genre, it as a subtle and satirical critique as well (of the genre, and of the American west - as it truly was). For example, in the western the hero is typically the sheriff. And true to form, the sheriff is the hero except with one twist : he's black. This is juxtaposed right next to sights gags (aka - telegraph for Mongo) and physical comedy (aka - campfire beans farting joke). This is a must see for any Brooks/Wilder fan.

His lifetime scope of work, the characters created, and the view of the world he has lives on in his two greatest motion picture parodies, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. Many younger people today are well aware of Brooks' smash Broadway play, The Producers, and it would serve them well to see the above two movies as a further testimonial to his artistry.I won't even go player by player, including Brooks himself, other than to say the characters played by this all-star cast will live on in movie history. Everything from the writing, to the concept, to the homage paid to the westerns of past movie generations, and to poking fun at our own view of history is wrapped up in this thoroughly enjoyable film.

But they will lack substance, since this kind of humour is the easiest one to make. Now, try making a parody with a sense of respect for the original, which is funny and sweet. That's though.Although Young Frankenstein is my favourite Brooks' parody, Blazing Saddles rates quite highly on many fronts. First, it is a very clean comedy. The jokes are funny, but never insulting. Witness Brooks previews in History of the World; those are cheap laughs.

Like most of my favorite comedies (\"A Night at the Opera\" or \"Tootsie\"), the laughs build until they explode into a few explosively funny scenes at the end. The stupidity of the characters in general brings many of the laughs, though I mostly laugh at the ridiculous and absurd situations, such as building a phony replica of the town, the singing of a bogus hymn in church, or the gathering of all the great warriors for battle toward the end. The scenes on the various movie sets, which I won't give away by describing in detail, are some of the funniest ten minutes I've ever seen on film. Cleavon Little is perfectly cast as the sheriff, and Gene Wilder is nearly as good as he was in \"Young Frankenstein.\" Madeline Kahn, in her Oscar-nominated role, is very funny as usual. Although there are a ton of big laughs in this film, I object to the general crude and sexual-related humor in the film. The constant \"N\" words are also a downside to this film. The film could be controversial for these reasons. Don't get me wrong. You're guaranteed to get some great laughs from this movie.

            "content": "Blazing Saddles is such a network favorite on TV that it is refreshing to view the film in its unexpurgated form. Mel Brooks says that he hates the TV network version and I can see why. In fact, clips of the TV version are shown on the DVD in the extras sections, particularly the campfire/farting scene.The extras are interesting as far as they go but they are also rather repetitious. The Mel Brooks comments section where the film is replayed so that Mel can comment on it is not what it purports to be, since his comments are in general and not pertaining to the specific section of the film being played. In fact, most of the film is played in this section with no comments at all in the later scenes. This could have been handled just as well in an interview format and I suppose it was done this way to deliberately take up more space.The transfers and Dolby sound are fine but I wasn't impressed with the extras. I'd give the DVD itself a 5 or 6 only.The original film is something else. Certainly, it has to be one of the granddaddies of outrageous comedy and, as has been pointed out often enough in the comments, the film could not be made today. The N word especially would make it quite politically incorrect but the import of the film is not to put down the black; quite the opposite. And apparently Richard Pryor wrote most of these remarks.But I always thought the final scenes were rather a stretch with Mel not knowing how to end the film. Mel's putdown of gays in general may not be simple homophobia but it certainly seems to come close in this film. (The comments make sure that Dom DeLuise's wife is mentioned though she is also in the film.) Yes, it's funny but I'm not sure what the scene is doing here.And, yes, Madeline's song as the Dietrich character Lili Von Shtupp (\"Schtupp\" is a Yiddish word for the sex act.), the Teutonic Titwillow is hilarious and, indeed, very \"dirty\" as Mel describes it and the \"German\" chorus boys who back her up are straight out of \"Springtime for Hitler\" in \"The Producers\" despite the 19th century costumes. \"Hitler's\" appearance in the commissary is probably a reference to the 40s actor, Robert \"Bobby\" Watson who played Hitler quite often in films of that time and even up to the early 60s. The character names are generally references to other characters or real persons such as Mel's Gov. William J. LePetomaine who references a popular early 20th-century French performer who could play tunes by turning around and breaking wind (No, I'm not making this up!). Carol Arthur (DeLuise) is Harriett Johnson, but I'm not sure who she was based on. Perhaps Harriet Van Horne a prolific newspaper critic and writer, Gabby Johnson was George \"Gabby\" Hayes, a famous western \"sidekick\" of the 40s, and Boris the Hangman was Boris Karloff who played a similar part (\"Mord\") in \"Tower of London\" (1939).Mel's Yiddish Indian, of course, is pure Mel and variations on this character seem to occur in many of his other films such as Yoda/Yogurt in Spaceballs and Friar Tuck/Rabbi Tuckman in Robin Hood: Men in Tights. (Neither of these films is nearly as good as Blazing Saddles IMHO.) In short hilarious and a real classic, but don't expect any real discipline from Mel!",

The wordplay and sight gags are packed so tightly that it takes several viewings before a viewer can catch them all. I must admit that, when it first came out, \"Blazing Saddles\" made me slightly uncomfortable, but I finally rationalized my laughing at it by figuring that Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor had the right to make fun of Jews and Blacks if they wanted -- and stupid Honkies while they were at it -- so why not join the fun? I don't give this movie a 10 because I don't feel that it's consistent all the way through. In my opinion the laughs peak at the fireside flatulence scene, and after that the film wanders off in some directions which aren't as funny as the first part. It's still worth seeing, as long as you aren't offended by scatological and racist references delivered with great enthusiasm and hilarity.

            "content": "First and foremost, for those of you who don't know, the previous film I've watched was Airplane! And by all means, I should've found that film funnier. Yet I laughed more watching this one. I still didn't laugh that much; it's not like I was laughing throughout its entirety. But I still laughed out loud more times while watching this film than I did with Airplane!As a whole, I thought this film, along with its narrative, was more coherent than Airplane! Was; whereas, in the latter, it felt like a whole lot of things put together to where specific ones are good and funny, better than others, but the film itself is lackluster. This film seemed better, altogether, with some of the things themselves not \"landing right,\" so to speak. I hope that makes sense.I don't know the \"status\" of this film; whether it's considered an iconic one. I would assume that it is, to an extent. And I'd imagine that it's similar to Airplane! And that's in the sense that most people like it a lot and think it's one of the best comedy films of all time. I wouldn't go that far; maybe watching it for the first time now instead of back when it was released or somewhere around there plays a part in that. Who knows.I thought this film had a fantastic ensemble of characters. The ones that stood out the most to me; and whose existences elevated the film as a whole: Hedley Lamarr, Taggart, Bart, Jim, Lyle, and Lili Von Shtupp. And I know that's pretty much every significant character, but I did say this film had a fantastic ensemble of characters. Those characters did a lot for this film and my enjoyment watching it.Speaking of things that did a lot for the film, I thought the soundtrack elevated this film, too. I thought it did a good job when it came to evoking certain feelings and emotions. More specifically, the song at the start of the film was fantastic, and so was the song at the end. Both of them were my favorites, or it; it could've been a single song. But the entire soundtrack was good. The soundtrack is one of the aspects that did a lot for this film, at least for me.Here are some of my particular thoughts:The beginning was the funniest (and best) part of the entire film for me. That whole song segment was gold, and the way Cleavon Little started getting into it or as the character was gold, too. Lyle's dialogue, reaction, and expressions were gold as well. Props to Burton Gilliam.Most people probably won't get this reference, but there's a Youtube channel by the name of, YaBoyRockLee. And the guy on the right side of their videos (from our perspective) sounds a lot like Charlie, played by Charles McGregor. I thought that was very interesting.I knew Howard Johnson looked familiar; John Hillerman, of course. He played Higgins in the original Magnum, P. I. For some reason, the actor who I thought of was Christian McKay; he played Mayor Samuel Blake in Cinemax's but now HBO Max's Warrior. But I knew it couldn't have been him since he was born one year before this film was released.The improvised line (\"You know, morons.\") by Gene Wilder was a good moment, as was Cleavon Little's subsequent breaking of character by laughing: and then, going back into character for continuing the scene. That happened to add a lot to that scene, making it more impactful; no wonder it's in the film despite that.Lili von Shtupp's song performance was a little awkward to watch. The dance sequence in Airplane! Was better. But after watching it a second time, it didn't seem that awkward. If both that performance and the dance sequence in Airplane! Were to be compared, I'd prefer the latter.The fourth-wall break at the end was lame. Some people possibly think it was the best part/their favorite part, but I thought it was lame. Once it reached the theater part, that's when it wasn't as lame.I know some people believe that Bart and Jim were in love with each other, to a certain extent, I suppose: and to be honest: I can see it. Either way, I thought their companionship and camaraderie were one of the best aspects of this film.All-in-all, I was entertained watching this film, although I don't think my perspective towards it is similar to most people's perspective, in that it's one of the best comedy films for them or maybe objectively as well. As far as my opinion is concerned, I think this film is somewhat 'up there' when it comes to objectively, but not that high up: and while it may stick out more and seem like one of the best comedy films I've watched after I've seen a lot more comedy films, right now, I wouldn't say it is. At most, I was entertained, and sometimes, that's enough; sometimes, that has to be enough.",

And not to downplay the crude humor--if it is done well, it's funny, not stupid or silly, and Brooks does it well.This film has it all in spades (haha), with a black sheriff (Bart, played by Cleavon Little) in an all-white western town), accompanied by his phenomenal gunslinging sidekick (Gene Wilder).  They are surrounded by an amalgam of characters, many in racial or role-playing categories (e.g., Mexican bandits, Mexican bikers), and many anachronistic, like Madeline Kahn in a Marlene Dietrich take-off.  Most of all, we have Mongo, more of a \"what\" than a \"who,\" played by ex-pro football star Alex Karras.  Brooks himself makes it in too, as a nonvirtuous but somewhat detached governor, manipulated by chief villain Hedley Lamarr, pun intended (Harvey Korman), and as an Indian Chief.  Slim Pickens (define perfectly cast) is Lamarr's sidekick and chief instrument.The crude stuff is great, but racial and religious elements -- indeed all elements -- are subject to both the crude and the very witty.  Cliches and one liners are satirized, and there are evocations of previous films. Brooks' mockery of the white townsfolk (all named Johnson, and all ignorant, except for one educated history expert who uses possessives when modifying gerunds with noun adjectives) produces some of the best lines:  \"Randolph Scott\"  and the Irish line (if you have seen it, you know it, I won't give it away).  But my favorite (Waco Kid to Bart, re the townspeople):  \"These are people of the land, you know, morons.\"A wild time and never a dull moment.",

Mel Brooks has taken the typical \"classical\" western story and turned it upside down.  The basic story is still followed but the hero is a black man with a 1970 attitude, the villain is misnamed after Hedy Lamar and the love interest is a thinly veiled parody of Marlene Dietrich's Frenchy from \"Destry Rides Again\".  The ending is truly inventive and memorable but somehow stays true to western theme.  With this film, \"The Producers\" and \"Young Frankenstein\", it appeared that in the mid-70's Brooks could do no wrong.  Sadly, nothing he has made since that heady period has come close.

Yes, it had railroad construction, saloon brawls, hanging parties, some gun play, but those staples were mere parts of the major spoof the film was eager to place on western cinema. And, it succeeded on all counts.The story opens at the railroad construction site, where two of the crewmen, two Africans, are made to go look for a possible quicksand sighting. They find it, also fall victims to the site, but manage to rescue themselves, then Bart, the hero, slams a shovel against the head of Taggart, the rail boss that had put them in jeopardy, to begin with. From there, the film goes to the political scene, where Hedley Lamarr is attempting to pull a land grab scheme which will enable him to sell land to the railroad and make lots of money for himself. Only problem is that there is a small town, Rock Ridge, on that land, and the townspeople are very reluctant to give up their land to the railroad. Bart is named the new sheriff of Rock Ridge, it is hoped that the people will leave in disgust, but they rally behind Bart and his new deputy, the Waco Kid, played by Gene Wilder. The ultimate showdown between Hedley Lamarr's pack of villains, and Bart's good guys takes place in a hilarious, free-for-all brawl that erupts everywhere.Besides Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, and Harvey Korman, the cast is ably supported by Slim Pickens, Alex Karras, David Huddleston, Liam Dunn as the town's preacher, and Madelaine Kahn, delivering a spoof of another western classic, Marlena Dietrich in \"Destry Rides Again.\"",

Cast: Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn, Mel Brooks.Where do I begin with this movie? It is rude, crude, tasteless, not politically correct--- this is why it is so dam good! Blazing saddles has all the requisites for a great comedy. This is one movie where the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts(did I say that right!) Every actor is good in their own right but together-- wow! It is non stop laughter. For example, the scene at the beginning when the two black guys are on the cart and they end up in quick sand and the white guys come to rescue not them but the hand cart. And of course the famous farting scene. Also, the skit with Madeline Kahn in the bar still makes me roar with laughter. The scene with Mel brooks as 'the gov', it goes on and on. It seems as if everyone has seen this movie but if you haven't, go out today and either rent it or preferably buy it.As far as the cast goes, they are all great. Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman are hilarious. Gene Wilder and Cleavon Litte are great together. Richard Pryor was originally chosen for the part that was eventually given to Cleavon Little but was unable to do so. He did help write the screenplay however. I thought Cleavon Little was great in this part.And of course there's Mel Brooks who not only acted in but also directed, co-wrote and did the music for(I love the theme song!) This movie has been accused of being racist but it is not at all. In interviews Mel Brooks has stated that most black people that he talked to were not offended and thought that the movie was funny. It was white people that thought it was racist. My only real complaint about this move is perhaps the end when the cast goes running around Warner Brothers studios and Hollywood. I'm not so sure that was necessary. Anyhow, it does have some funny moments and it features Dom Deluise. This along with Young Frankenstein(also by Mel Brooks)are among the all time funniest.

            "content": "...\"Blazing Saddles\" is mostly a parody of the cheesy westerns of the fifties and sixties, about a crooked railroad boss (Harvey Korman) who appoints a black sheriff, Bart (Cleavon Little) to a town where he wants the land to put a railroad through. Bart gets help from the Wacko Kid (Gene Wilder) in his fight against the raving, moronic bandits assaulting the town (led by Slim Pickens). This is directed by Mel Brooks, and along with 'Young Frankenstein' and 'The Producers', makes the trio of his most popular films. Compared to the other two, 'Blazing Saddles' is swimming in a pool of mediocrity.Aside from Little's overacting \u0096 even for parody \u0096 the actors are the best part of the film. Gene Wilder wipes the floor with the rest of the cast in his quiet, wise, hilarious parody of the quick drawing characters of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. Korman and Pickens are funny, and Madeline Kahn is fantastic in an early role (and Oscar nominated too) as the 'tired' Bulgarian lounge singer Lili Von Shtupp.The actors are mostly great, but what they're saying isn't. It's all just too over the top. In 'Dr. Strangelove', 'The Holy Grail' and 'Airplane!' the characters didn't know that they were in a satire. In 'Blazing Saddles' they do. A good example of this is when a drunken man shouts in clich\u00e9 western terms, and then David Huddleston stands up and says 'I'm glad he said it in good, clear western jargon'. It's just too forced.Mel Brooks is definitely one of Hollywood's biggest egos. He has a short, funny scene as the governor, which worked fine for a short cameo, but then we see him again as this character, and then again as a different one, and he stops being funny \u0096 fast. I'd go as far as to say he ruins potentially good scenes.The script, well\u0085Brooks and Wilder had to make cuts on the 'Young Frankenstein' script because for every one joke that worked there were three that didn't. Should've done the same for this one, 6.5/10.",

This movie takes issues such as racism just when we were leaving that period behind and makes a joke out of it. PURE GENIUS! It also parodies the western genre.Plot: The story is about an evil man named Hedley Lamarr back in 1874 who wants to drive people out of a town. He decides to send someone to scare them off. Therefore, he simply sends a black man to be the sheriff of Rock Ridge and the laughs never let up.Acting: One of the strong points in this movie is the acting. This is one of the few comedies to have someone nominated in acting for an Oscar. That someone is Madeline Kahn who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress with barely 15 minutes of screen time. Cleavon Little gives a great performance as Bart The Black Sheriff. Gene Wilder also gives a great performance as The Waco Kid or Jim. Even Mel Brooks and Alex Karras the football player have roles. Mel Brooks plays a dimwitted governor and Karras plays the large but dimwitted Mongo.Genre/Quality: This is undoubtedly a comedy and one of the funniest movies ever made. This movie takes racism and westerns and makes a joke on them. For anyone who thinks this movie is racist, get a life and a sense of humor. You'd have to watch the movie without paying attention. Bart the Sheriff is the hero. The music in this movie is great nabbing an Oscar nomination. The script is good which was if I'm not mistaken was co-written by Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor.In conclusion, this is one of the funniest movies ever made. This movie is one of the major examples of Mel Brooks' comedic genius.10/10",

They really need to get a grasp of satire, because every idiot in this movie is white. The WHITE people are the stupid/racist ones! I saw that at the age of 10!

The two main characters, in a western set back when railroads were still being built as the main mode of long distance travel, ride off in a limousine at the end! But it's hilarious!

While there seem to be some lulls, Brooks overall succeeds at depicting outrageous racism, often without much humor to shield the audience or the protagonist from its blunt impact, and then succeeds in depicting an almost cartoonish comedic effort to squash it. It's a \"deconstruction\" of the western in that it fills in the blanks, rather than, say, the thoughtless revisionism that leads to casting Will Smith as the lead in Wild, Wild West and hoping we'll accept that no white character in the film notices.It is, then, interesting to see how positive and forceful the political message of this film is, considering that the most one gets out of Producers is that gays and Germans are allegedly funny.

Not that prejudice is funny but the movie shows how stupid these bigots are so it makes you laugh. Actor Clevon Little excellently portrays Bart, the sheriff put in place by Heldey Lamarr in the hopes that the residents will leave town so Lamarr can build a railroad through it. Lamarr's plan backfires because Sheriff Bart wins over the townspeople with his willingness to put his life on the line to save the town from demolition. Mel Brooks often uses clich\u00e9s and jokes about the customs and traditions of particular groups. He often pokes fun at the Jewish and he himself is Jewish.Actors Harvey Korman (Heldey Lamarr) and Gene Wilder (the Waco Kid) are also excellent and perfectly casted. When you find out Richard Pryor co-wrote the screenplay, it all makes sense that such an original and fresh movie came out in 1974. Pryor is arguably one of the greatest comedians of the 20th century. The ending of the movie is over the top chaotic fun, but it's hard to picture the movie ending any other way.If you haven't seen \"Blazing Saddles\", you're truly missing out on a comedic gem.",

            "content": "Mel Brooks and his usual cast of characters (Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, et al) are at it again in \"Blazing Saddles.\"  Korman plays Hedley Lamarr, a corrupt politician who is determined to acquire a tract of land occupied by a western town.  To ease his plot, he dispatches a black sheriff named Bart (Cleavon Little) to oversee the rule of law in 'the village of the Johnsons.'  To find out what happens from there, see the movie.  Some of the gags in the movie are so funny, you might almost forget about the plot. These include the Camptown Ladies scene, Mel Brooks as a Yiddish Indian, and, of course the part where they're eating beans around a campfire.  Songs are always an integral part of Brooks comedies, and this one is no different; included in the film are \"The Theme From Blazing Saddles,\" \"The Ballad of Lili von Schtupp,\" and \"The French Mistake.\"  For the record, Schtupp is a western seductress played by Madeline Kahn.  Also take note of ex-Detroit Lion Alex Karras' performance as Mongo.  Rent \"Blazing Saddles\" when you get the chance, or \"...you'll be surprised YOU'RE doing the French mistake.  Voila!\"",

Visual jokes are more funny when you actually see them, obviously; also, a generous amount of verbal and running jokes (\"What in the wide, wide world of sports...\", \"...these are people of the land. you know...morons!...\", \"It's Hedley, not Headdy!\", everyone in Rock Ridge having the last name \"Johnson\" etc.); Not to mention all the deliberate anachronisms with Broadway songs, the WWII German soldiers etc. cropping up throughout - which in the context of the movie being a parody of your archetypal Western, enhances the film's satirical nature; many of the jokes also draw attention to the racist attitudes of those in \"the Ole West\" and criticizes them for that through humour, and/or by making them look dumb, foolish or otherwise, silly.(P) Chemistry between Bart the Sheriff (Cleavon Little) and Jim, the Waco Kid, (Gene Wilder) was strong, bouncing off of each other well i.e. their quickly founded friendship was instantly believable; in addition, the acting as a whole was also very well done.(?)

            "content": "\"Blazing Saddles\" is an all out parody of the Hollywood western, and a satire of the old west itself, and all of the racism and unnecessary violence that comes along without. Don't get me wrong though, this isn't a dark film. In fact, this is a monumentally ridiculous film, filled to the brim with meta jokes and insanely over exaggerated stereotypes. It is a subversion of the classic western tale of a sheriff taking on a group of bandits, because it is a tale about a politician working for a governor who devises a plan to appoint the first black sheriff for a town in danger, hoping that the sheriff will fail and the town will be destroyed, making it possible to build the railroad through that town and giving the governor a chance at becoming president since he made history by appointing the first black sheriff. Of course, his plan goes terribly wrong when Bart, the black sheriff, is actually competent, and manages to turn the town's opinion of him around. It often laughs in the face of racism and the barbaric nature of the wild west, with the racist whites often being the butt of many jokes. The irony is that this addresses the real injustices of that time more directly than any of those real classic Westerns.It is a fun movie with some hilarious moments, most notably the wild, unpredictable, self-referential ending which takes a sharp left turn and goes way farther in that direction than I expected it would. There are plenty more very clever jokes, and it uses everything at its disposal to create punchline after punchline, whether it be physical, visual, verbal, or in a song. However, some jokes did fall flat for me, such as the frog in the bathtub, the beans dinner scene, and most of the \"I'm Tired\" song, which goes on for far too long, clocking in at 5 minutes and 30 seconds worth of a joke that wasn't very funny to begin with.Regardless, it has some hilarious writing and performances throughout, with Mel Brooks himself even making an appearance as the idiotic and inept governor. There is humor that is in your face, there is more subtle humor, and there are plenty of obscure references used to craft jokes that you would need to research to understand. It can get a laugh out of a cut, a line, or an action.",

            "review_title": "The Old West, with a satirical twist.",
            "content": "Mel Brooks is known for his unique brand of comedy, typically blending the best of low brow humor, old school Hollywood musical numbers, and parodying of genre films and Hollywood as a whole. His films walk the line between tasteless raunchiness and comedy gold, which is why we love him so much. Being co-written by the one and only Richard Pryor, his 1974 film Blazing Saddles could be described as walking the line backwards while blindfolded and juggling plates. It takes the audience on a wild ride of laughs that pokes fun at the racial climate of America in the early 1970s and the absurdity of Hollywood under the guise of a traditional western.Blazing Saddles follows the story of Bart, a simple black man who wastes his days building railroads and being oppressed for his skin color, who unseemingly becomes the sheriff of the town of Rock Ridge. The villainous Hedley Lamarr uses his political influence to appoint Bart as sheriff, hoping it will drive the citizens of Rock Ridge out of town so they could build the railroad right down its main street. But once Bart becomes sheriff, he and his new partner Jim, prove to the townsfolk that his skin color does not dictate his character and ends up saving the town for Lamarr and his baddies. The film is shot beautifully with camera work that calls back to Golden Age westerns, with wide shots capturing the beauty of the landscape and closeups showing the focus of the cowboy's faces during a shootout. The cinematic charm of this film bleeds through further with the extravagant costumes and sets, and old west personality that each actor brings to the characters. Cleavon Little transforms the tired old west sheriff into a cool, easy going urbanite. His role seems to be making a more figurative statement to the literal saying \"there's a new sheriff in town,\" in the broader metaphor for race in Hollywood that Brooks is trying to make. Post civil rights, many African American actors were getting their time in the spotlight, which obviously rustled some feathers in the industry. Brooks is known for rustling feathers even more, and his main character does that quite well, using tired race jokes and sarcasm to say to the prejudiced, \"I'm here now and I'm not going anywhere.\" The film makes a very general statement on the absurdity of race throughout, pointing out the bigger racial and ethnic conflicts of the 20th century; Native Americans vs. White settlers, Blacks and Asians vs. Whites, Jews vs. Germans. The famous line \"We'll take the blacks and the chincs, but not the Irish,\" is a good example of how ridiculous Brooks sees the idea of racism. Blazing Saddles is one of those films that will be quoted for decades thanks Brooks' knack for saying the wrong thing at the right time and the incomparable chemistry felt between the cast, thanks to it being a typical Mel Brooks ensemble cast. Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, and Dom Deluise are Mel Brooks regulars, and people are used to seeing them together in the wild romps. Wilder's stoic sarcasm, Kahn's firecracker personality, Korman's sinister dimwittedness, and Deluise's explosive voice and movements are all commonplace in Brooks films and this one is no different. A lovely pseudo-satire that brings golden age charm with pretty racy comedy, Blazing Saddles is one of the best examples of Mel Brooks' filmography. Poking fun at Hollywood and racism while still delivering a musical number that many adoring fans know the words to is something only Mel Brooks can do. This is a very good entry into his brand of comedy and should only lead you to dive into his collection completely.",

The next best thing is the acting, Gene Wilder, Cleaveland Little, Slim Pickins, and many more give much enthusiam to the lines, and really tell you that these western folk don't give a hoot, and they just do what there told. A fun blast, and anyone who has respect for comedy, and Mel Brooks will enjoy this movie. Ten out of ten stars, see it right away if you haven't.",

            "content": "Sometimes the best way to get a message across is through comedy. Mel Brooks, however unintentionally, achieved this with \"Blazing Saddles\", which through off-color humor shows how truly idiotic racism is. That's not to say the movie is preachy or maudlin; on the contrary, it's easily Brooks's most outrageous film. \"Blazing Saddles\" is filled with shameless ribaldry and constant use of the n-word. The fact that Richard Pryor assisted in the scriptwriting must have compounded the shocking humor (he was originally going to play Black Bart, but was considered too controversial). It also contains the now legendary campfire scene with its symphonic chorus of flatulence. It's the American west in 1874, and the verbose and dastardly Hedy, er, Headley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) has an evil scheme: to drive out the citizens of Rock Ridge in order to build a railroad through the town. He devises a way to scare off each and every one of them: send a new sheriff who is so shocking, so offensive, that they leave in fear and disgust. Who is chosen to drive away the inbred (all the citizens' last names are Johnson), racist, citizens? Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker, who immediately earns the hatred of Rock Ridge's rednecks. Yet the ever cool and unflappable Bart refuses to be cowed by a little bit of prejudice, so he sets out to earn some respect from the townsfolk. He first achieves this by taming wanted menace Mongo (Alex Karras, who would later play George on \"Webster\"), a monosyllabic brute who rides an ox and can lean his who body into a fire to light a cigar without getting burned (even fire's scared of him!). Once everyone gets wind of Headley Lamarr's scheme, Bart unites everyone to win back Rock Ridge in the longest, funniest drag-down fight ever. The plot is tissue thin and the ending is utterly absurd, but \"Blazing Saddles\" is such shocking fun and full of hilarious characters, you won't mind. There plenty of appearances by Brooks's staple actors including a laid-back Gene Wilder, taking a break from his usual neurotic shtick, as the Waco Kid, a washed-up gunslinger who becomes Bart's loyal sidekick. Then there's the ever-reliable Madeleine Kahn as Lili Von Schtupp, a sexy, lisping Marlene Dietrich-style saloon singer who tries to ensnare Bart. Brooks himself plays incompetent horndog Governor LePetomane, a cross-eyed fool whom Headley Lamarr easily manipulates. All the actors seem to enjoy tweaking the familiar formulas of westerns. Prissy-faced Korman is uproarious as an effete and utterly ineffective villain, and has some of the best lines (\"You will be risking your lives, whilst I will be risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for the Best Supporting Actor!\"). Cowboy star Slim Pickens is also a hoot as Lamarr's sidekick Mr.Taggart, who's long on ethnic slurs but short on intellect. Little is slick and hilarious as Bart, even though he sometimes comes off as Richard Pryor Lite. It's a shame he never became a bigger star... he truly had a charismatic screen presence. There is a sort of potential star-making scene when the newly appointed Sheriff Bart rides to town in his color-coordinated cowboy suit, horse, and Gucci bag. As always, Brooks uses his patented formula of combining edgy humor with tried and true vaudevillian buffoonery and cartoon slapstick. For instance, Bart pulls a Bugs Bunny by trapping Mongo with an explosive candy box (they even use the familiar Looney Tunes theme at the end of the scene). And when Bart and a colleague take a railroad cart and sink into quicksand, an overseer rides up and lassos\u0085 the railroad cart, leaving Bart and his friend to suffer. Yeah, this movie may have all but killed the Western, but, when it's Mel Brooks, who cares?",

In order to run the town's residents away, he decides to make black convict Bart (Little) to be sheriff.Lamarr's plan works and the very racist people don't like the idea of an African American sheriff.

            "content": "Great comedy is born, forged, fashioned and bred in a crucible of sensitivity, learning and icon-worship/iconoclasm. Mel Brooks, a man who I believe could have made his career as a historian, a film-critic, a political columnist, has opened up his vault of talents to create a comedy that will persist for generations. Why? Why does Mr. Brooks have the keys to the kingdom?Well, for starters, someone once said that genius stands on the shoulders of giants. Mr. Brooks is well versed in American movie history and has viewed and sublimated the cannon adroitly and with considerable flare and facility. From Cole Porter references to \"Gabby Johnson,\" Brooks unfurls a flag of American film history and a quick hand at the card table of American comedy. He knows when to drop the right line, the correct reference, he understands how films and human knowledge build upon the advances made by their predecessors. Brooks could be a historian because he knows what films work together properly, how they are connected and why if you cross certain themes the result is unmitigated hysteria and gut splitting laughter. Who else would have paired Cole Porter's \"I Get A Kick Out of You\" with an inter-racial western complete with Yiddish Indians? Who else would have the sense to know how to properly assault the genre of the American Western with just the right dose of absurdity? Brooks is a sensitive man. Comedy is the result of those who must laugh at themselves, their short comings, their myopia. Comedy is born out of the humility imposed by suffering, therefore if suffering is to be remedied and good fortune and mirth restored, whose suffering is safe from the razor-blade of satire, self-reflection and parody? To laugh is to forfeit the sanctity of the human mind in order to reap a whirlwind of instant gratification, a luminiscent gratification that can only come when one makes a joke or becomes the butt of someone else's joke. We remember folly and foolishness much more readily than morality and the lessons of profound wisdom. Why? Because we are all, deep down inside, confronted with our own appalling inequities and a horrific sense of timing. A comedian knows this and unlike a psychologist or psychiatrist who takes these coups seriously, the comedian knows that truly great art, born of suffering, is still more irridescent when it evokes a laugh, at least for him bent on instant gratification.Brooks knows his stuff. He understands how to cross genres and he has been blessed with an immutable gift for irony. Everything is ironic! Watch this movie! And learn a little about the mythic and cosmological past of your entertainment industry as well as find out what it could have been like on the range with all of those fools who thought they were doing God's work in settling our wild frontier.",

            "content": "\"Blazing Saddles\" was a time when he was at his best. And that year he went from a writer/director with two failed (financially speaking) comedies (\"The Producers\", \"The Twelve Chairs\") to one of the biggest comedy writer/directors of that time. As this film, and \"Young Frankenstein\" did both big box office, but were hits with critics and audiences alike. Brooks was a lucky man though, as this story wasn't his idea, and it came along to him as he was looking for change in gutters of New York. Brooks picked up the project, hired on the original writer (Andrew Bergman) as well as a few others (Including Richard Pryor) and along came \"Blazing Saddles\". It is the greatest spoof of western films and will continue to be that forever. The racism jokes may get a little old, and there are some cheap jokes (as there are in all of Brooks' film), but all in all, you laugh quite a bit at this film. There are a couple of hilarious and outragous moments (including the camp fire scene, and the wacky ending that could only be a part of a Mel Brooks film) and there are a few funny moments and jokes, as well as a truck load of small, cheap, so-so, and failed jokes. This was the time when Brooks was the master of complete lunacy, and he continued to do so up until just after \"History of the World\", he toned down a bit. In his later comedies such as \"Spaceballs\", you still find some hilarious and crazy moments, but you can tell that Brooks lost his edge some. Not that I don't recommend that film, as I pretty much recommend any Mel Brooks film, for the fact you will always find something funny. Overall, this is a 8 out of 10, or **** out of *****. Ranks up there with \"Young Frankenstein\" and \"History of the World Part I\" as Brooks' best films.",

As Mel Brooks recently stated - the film could not be made now, thanks to an over PC aware censure board (the word 'nigger' is considered offensive - hence it is stressed throughout; not to mention 'methodist' and 'irish' - creeds which also are the butt of comedy at various points but would not pass in todays' climate. [Hey, if you are so credible, how come you can't take ridicule in a comedy vehicle?])I feel the film still works on many levels apart from the basic plot. It manages to both salute the classic western whilst ripping the hell out of it. This film, along with The Producers, is surely Mel Brooks finest hour and still makes one laugh, both with and at its surreal take on 'the western'. If your only impression is one of a low grade cornball comedy and the 'fart scene' is the only one you recall, then you have really missed the point.",

He saw what politically correct can do, so he made this whilst combining blaxploitation and Western genres to make this parody.Cleavon Little stars as Black Bart, a railroad worker destined to be hung because he hit his boss in the head with a shovel, is appointed mayor of Rock Ridge, which is to be destroyed, by greedy Attorney General Hedley \"Hedy\" Lamarr.

I am white and I know that the N word is offensive but in the context of this movie I believe it to be funny, because with humor it shows the stupidity of prejudice people. I fully understand times have changed, but I believe they should not edit movies. The TV stations should issue parental discretion advisory and air the program in a suitable time not for prime time family viewing. I would like to get the opinion of a African American person, so yes I would like to hear from anyone who is willing to voice an opinion.Thanks,Kino Mann",

            "content": "I have been a fan of Mel Brooks all of my life, and growing up, I enjoyed watching \"Blazing Saddles,\" \"Young Frankenstein,\" \"Silent Movie,\" and \"High Anxiety.\"  Of these 4 movies only \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein\" are on DVD.  I thoroughly enjoyed the extensive special edition DVD treatment of \"Young Frankenstein\" and I own it as part of my DVD collection, but as for \"Blazing Saddles,\" it just doesn't have the DVD touch. The movie itself is one of those special comedies such as \"Young Frankenstein,\" \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" \"Airplane!,\" and \"Caddyshack\".  \"Blazing Saddles\" is a timeless spoof of the western genre and time gets kinder to it as the years pass.  This movie stars Brooks and his usual gang of cronies - Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, Dom DeLuise, and Harvey Korman.  Everyone in this is memorable.  We will always remember Cleavon Little as the black sheriff who is subject to the N-word by the prejudiced denizens of Rock Ridge, Harvey Korman as the crafty attorney general Hedley Lamarr who upsets the town with the sheriff and a railroad running through it, Dom DeLuise in a cameo as a Hollywood movie director who gets coldcocked by the hero Slim Pickens as Taggart, Mel Brooks in dual roles as a Yiddish speaking Indian Chief and the corrupt, womanizing Governor William LePetomane, and Madeline Kahn, in her best role, as the sexy Lilli Von Shtupp, the German saloon chanteuse who seduces the sheriff, uttering one of the most imitated lines among viewers of Brooks films, \"It's Twue! It's Twue!\"  The humor may be too crude or too Jewish, but that is what makes Brooks films great.  Oh, and let's not forget hulky Alex Karras as the horse-punching Mongo who gets blown up by the sheriff into smithereens. As for the DVD itself, I found it to be a major disappointment.  This is one of the first DVDs to come out, and ever since DVDs have taken special treatment with more and more extras.  Other than cast and crew bios and production notes, there is a rambling 55-minute interview with Mel Brooks. We do not see his face, we only hear him whisper like a golf game announcer through footage of the first half of the movie, and I know that Brooks did a better job in his interview in a subsequent DVD of \"The Producers.\" Likewise, Gene Wilder did a great job in his interview in the DVD of \"Young Frankenstein\" where he talks about \"Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein.\"  The worst part of the DVD is the setup of the movie.  Most widescreen DVDs have thin boxes, but this movie has such thick boxes it makes the movie look too small to watch, as if we were looking at the movie through a telescope. Next year, \"Blazing Saddles\" will be a venerable 30 years old.  I would save my money to buy a 30th Anniversary re-release of \"Blazing Saddles\" with a better setup of the movie and more extras that would make the DVD worthwhile, if Mel Brooks and/or Warner Brothers bothers to re-release the DVD into a special edition, as so many earlier DVDs of classic movies are being made into right now.",

With the fight between the Hedley Lamar's 'Badmen' and the Rock Ridge citizens spilling out onto the other film sets things turn strange, as things tend to in a Mel Brooks Film. Having the Lead two actors go to the Cinema to see the end of the Film that they are in is a touch of class, the kind of class that can only be found in a film by this master of the Parody.Blazing Saddles is a romp through the West, destroying every tradition that Western films have built over film history. Whilst destroying the reputation of the Western - a genre that has no place in 21st century society - it still manages to be amazingly funny.But, its no Spaceballs. Blazing Saddles is a great film, but for anyone who wants a good Laugh, Spaceballs is the answer.",

Mel Brooks is an amazing director and took the risk about making a racist movie just after the civil rights movement. The reason why I am writing a review about Blazing Saddles is due to the laughter that it brought me.Summary: So there is this town in the middle of the American West called Rock Ridge. Looks like the stereotypical west in the late 1800's. However the town is threatened by a railroad company who are trying to build the track through their city. However, there are loopholes keeping the town intact. So the owner of the railroad company orders for the citizens to be scared off by hired mercenaries.After attacks on the town, the citizens request a new sheriff to run off the bandits. the sheriff turns out to be a black guy whom everyone is scared of. (the movie uses the word \"Nigger\" at least 100+ times). So after gaining a little bit of trust, the sheriff finds out that one of the current prisoners is \"The Waco Kid\". The sheriff befriends the Waco Kid and he and the town band together and stop the railroad company.It is hilarious, racial slurs, parodies, crossovers, and historical gangs, this movie will leave you in stitches. It is hard to explain in such a review, but I recommend you watch it.",

Cleavon Little is excellent in his role (as are Alex Karras and Gene Wilder) but Madline Kahn misses in her send up of Marlene Dietrich.  The humor especially works in the final scenes as Brooks completely breaks the four wall in a very effective manner.

This movie should be shown to all students in school to show just how idiotic \"Political Correctness\" is.  Remember, \"Sticks and Stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me\"?  This movie didn't let anyone go untouched. I saw this movie at the drive-in when it was released and have watched it at least 60 times since on tape, laserdisc, DVD and TV versions.",

It is simply put, a funny movie. From the opening scene with the cowboys dancing and singing to the limos at the end, I laughed all the way thru it and still do. The humour is extremely racist at times and not everyone appreciates it. If you can look past it and realize it's just a movie and LAUGH at all the parodies and witty dialog.

It's a shame that such a film would not be made nowadays; by sending-up racism it does more to condemn it that by pussyfooting around.Anyway, rants over - it's a very funny film, with some great one-liners and of course there's the famous bean-eating scene. It's funny the first time you see it - because of the way the unexpected happens - but also because of things going on that you recognise on the umpteenth viewing.Highly recommended from me.",

The story is paper thin. All characters behave like they are complete idiots. And the movie breaks the 4th wall so much that you have the feeling this is not really a movie, but a sketch from SNL (or one done by some highschoolers).\nAlso, this comedy is not funny, like, at all. It tries to be a parody of western movies, but here the thing - a good parody resembles quite close the original, so the joke is understood and funny. BS is so outrageous the supposed jokes fall flat. In the entire movie I laughed exactly once - when Hedly is listing people he's \"hiring\".\nBut the worst offence is the fact that BS is boring. Like, really boring. Nothing interesting, or funny, or at least mildy amusing ever happens.

Pickens said: \"Someone go back and get a shitload of dimes\".Then when Hadley tried to pass himself off as a student at the ticket booth of the movie theater. Then he bought Raisinettes.",

            "content": "I hate Mel Brooks movies, but my friend told me he'd seen Blazing Saddles 15 times, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Expect the usual lame Mel Brooks humor: bad jokes about Jews (greedy and money-loving), blacks (they dress snazzy and are well hung), and women (they love well hung black men!); and just overall backwards, old-fashioned sensibilities. There are a few funny scenes like when a man on a horse gets hanged (and the horse too!), how Bart tricks the townspeople when he first meets them, and the hilarious ending saves the movie from being a total wash. However, if you grew up watching comedy in today's time, I think you'll find that 75% of the humor in this movie falls pretty flat.Worth seeing once, but I wouldn't pay money for it.",

Obvious gag jokes coupled with sly humor about race, sex, and stereotypes make for, not just a fun movie, but a movie to watch again and again.  Every time I've seen it I've heard a new joke or caught a another sight gag.  It's just plain entertaining, whether it's a first viewing or a fifteenth.",

In my social circle, someone will quote a part of the movie and the next 5-10 minutes is spent with the rest of us filling in the lines. Truly one of the best comedic efforts ever put to the screen. I first saw this movie in a theater in 1974 with my father. I had never seen him laugh as hard as he did watching Blazing Saddles. We sat through the next showing and laughed even harder at all the bits we missed the first time through. Even now when I watch this movie, I catch a hilarious gag that I missed previously.",

The cast never takes the movie, or themselves, too seriously, which is very refreshing in the age of strained comedy and temperamental stars.",

Brooks takes shots at everyone, every race, creed, color and ethnic background is a punch line here.The cast (Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Mel Brooks, and Madeline Kahn among others) plays off each other and the silliness with practiced ease. They really seemed to be having fun with the movie and the gags, it seemed more like a group of friends goofing around than actors in a movie.Throughout the movie, stereotypes and bigotry are attacked, but attacked by making the viewer laugh at the nonsensical nature of the imagery.See this movie ... and laugh rather than cry.",
