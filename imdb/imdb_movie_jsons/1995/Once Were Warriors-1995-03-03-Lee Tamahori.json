            "content": "One of the best films of the 1990's, a brutal, brilliant & compelling film from New Zealand.  Brilliant performances from Morrison, Owen & Kerr-Bell as Gracie.  Morrison as Jake is one of film's most fearsome characters, full of true anger & hate but by no means a one-dimensional character.  As see the characteristics that made Beth fall in love with him in the first place, the passion, the charisma. A great script based on the novel of the same name. A must see 10/10",

            "content": "I don't know where to start. When I'm asked of my favorite movie ever, this is ALWAYS the first to come to mind. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen too many to count. Once Were Warriors is, at its most stripped, about a woman named Beth and her struggle to just do what's best for her family. She is of Maori heritage, New Zealand's sort of Native Americans. Culture is a proud and powerful aspect of the movie, as Beth's strengths lie in her devotion to her family and her heritage. But that is little comfort, as her daughter is struggling to accept adulthood, her youngest son is heading towards juvenile detention, and her oldest son is fast on his way to joining a brutal gang. Worst of all, her husband Jake is a heavy drinker.The film excels at painting everybody in full 3 dimensions. Each of her kids are troubled, but they all have fierce love and respect for their mother. The gang is cruel to the oldest son, but at the same time embraces him. The juvenile detention center separates the youngest son from his only home, but instills in him a pride in his ancestry. And Jake himself is a beast, a man built like a tank who will destroy you with anything available should you spill his beer...but somehow he also comes across as loving Beth. Sometimes.The film follows Beth as she does her best to hold the family together even while the various problems tear them apart. At the center is Jake's drinking and further carelessness of his family's dissipation. While Beth's answer is to nurture and aid her children, Jake insists it's best to drink away the problems and quit being so \"soft\" on the kids. And we watch, through it all, as the family spirals further apart. Near the end, after seeing both happy and horrible things happen to each of the characters, we are jarred by a terrible tragedy. Beth and Jake both deal with it uniquely, as she draws once again on the tremendous power of family and human spirit, while Jake deals with it his own way. The last 15 minutes of the film keep us in suspense as we wonder whether a certain horrible injustice will be confronted, and if so, how. This scenario involves and encapsulates everyone in the family, and who they are inside.The last few moments of the movie made me want to jump to my feet and applaud. I won't reveal what happens, but in the last 5 minutes, every person shows so much inner strength that I glow with admiration for their actions. Especially those of Beth and her oldest son, whose interaction with Jake results in my favorite scene in the movie. But don't think you know what's going to happen based on this description -it's a complicated scenario. I felt satisfied with the conclusion on all fronts, and thought that each character showed exactly where their strength lies. Be forewarned that this movie is very heartbreaking. Its overall tone is one of futility, of better lives not received, of wanting the best but never quite getting it. It is very raw and intense in its portrayal of physical and domestic violence, and the easily upset may have a hard time waiting to see if it ends happily enough for their tastes. But no matter what your opinion is, it will definitely be a film that stays with you for a long, long time. My highest recommendation.",

            "content": "There are films where you can see extensive carnage and it doesn't move you. This is a film where you see a man hit his wife and it hits you in the gut like you're being hit yourself.  An excellent depiction of the impact of anger and violence on the members of a poor family.  In this case, they happen to be Maoris living in New Zealand. The father dominates the family because he is so powerless in the other facets of his life.  He's addicted to boozing and carousing and the only way he can really express himself is with his fists.  The wife fights back, but can be beaten into submission. But she's also allowed herself to be seduced by the boozy lifestyle and fears responsibility.  The center of the family is the oldest daughter (13), who is really the only one who can communicate with all the other members. The boys are either lost in life or lost in their own rage.  The youngest daughter is simply too small and clings to her sister. It takes a tragedy to allow some of these individuals to reach out for each other and try to re-create a form of family life.  A very powerful film, not for the faint of heart.",

            "review_title": "Portrait of the self-destructive family",
            "content": "Twenty minutes into this movie, Jake Heke hits his wife in the face. It's not a slap, but the full power of a clenched fist delivered into her jaw. She smashes backwards into a wall and collapses, cursing at him. Jake then picks her up and beats her some more, dragging her bloodied form all across the house and utterly mauling her, destroying lots of the furniture, trashing the living room and breaking glass over the poor woman's frail body. Their friends quickly scatter and retreat out the front, while upstairs the children huddle together in tears, 13 year old Grace Heke more than likely thinking of her earlier remark that \"people show their true feelings while drunk.\" In terms of grabbing the viewer's attention, this entire sequence has more effect than being punched in the gut.Set in an un-named New Zealand city, Once Were Warriors tells the story of the Heke family. Jake (Temeura Morrison) is a handsome, muscular powerhouse who exudes natural charisma, while his wife Beth (Rena Owen) is descended from a Maori tribe. And while on the surface Jake seems like a loving father and husband, he is a man racked with paranoia and insecurity who is prone to terrifying outbursts of violence, to which he rarely shows any regret. And his behaviour is having an adverse effect on the rest of the family to say the least.With one son taken away and sent to a Maori reform school and another joining a violent street gang, Beth struggles to keep her family together and the end result is very grim, but nothing less than satisfying. In fact, you'll be hard pressed to turn away from the screen as you get sucked into the characters lives, despite the rather depressing nature of the subject matter.For while Jake is an absolute monster of a human being, he is still very clearly human. Temeura Morrison's performance is nothing short of exemplary, as he manages to turn Jake into a highly complex character. One moment he seems like the perfect friend, singing a duet alongside Beth at a party with smiles plastered across their faces, the next he is pounding his fist into her face with such ferocity it is almost like he has been replaced with somebody else. It is testament to Morrison's acting skills that while everyone is urging Beth to leave with the children, we can see why she doesn't.This is a dark film and not especially pleasant viewing. However, it is also a riveting experience and far from a portrait of one man's self-destruction, as the rest of the family also have their own characters fleshed out and fully realised. One brief review like this cannot adequately portray what a terrific film this is, highly recommended.",

            "content": "I've been reading the comments that people have made on this brilliant piece of film making that makes me proud to be a kiwi. Although I'm not Maori, I have somewhat of an understanding of, and a very deep appreciation for Maori culture. It is after all a major contributor to the uniqueness of New Zealand, and it's what a lot of the tourists come here to see/experience.Some people have commented that the character of Beth is \"descended from Maori royalty\" and that the character of Jake is \"descended from slaves\". That's not quite correct. Although there is a Maori monarch; (Dame Te Atairangikaahu, the current Maori queen lives at the Turangawaewae Marae in Ngaruawahia, her official residence.) the Maori monarchy only goes back to the 19th century, and its not really representative of all Maori as it only really affects Waikato iwi/hapu, (tribe/sub tribe) It is more likely that Beth would be descended from chiefly linage, and hence she and her whanau, (extended family) would be very much aware of and in tune with their whakapapa or ancestry. Beth's line near the end of the movie that her people \"once were warriors\" is an indicator of this.(The facial and body tattoos, or Moko that one sometimes sees Maori wearing are in fact representative of their whakapapa. Also, the carvings that feature on Marae and other carved Maori buildings/gates etc are representative of tribal ancestors, much like Indian Totem poles.)Jake on the other hand is obviously urbanized. He would most probably know little or nothing about his whakapapa, and in addition he probably would not even be able to identify with an iwi or hapu. This would explain why he makes several references to \"Maori bulls***\". He is disenfranchised from his culture, and probably doesn't even speak Maori that well. (Although Temurera Morrison himself speaks fluent Maori.) His family have obviously been living in Auckland for so long, and there has been such tribal intermingling, that he doesn't know whether he's Arthur or Martha. And what's more, he doesn't care either.(For those of you who are interested, the motorway shown at the start of the movie is the Southern Motorway which runs right through South Auckland, which is where *a lot* of Maoris and Pacific Islanders live.)As other people have said, this kind of thing is sadly not unique to Maori, as American/Canadian Indians and Australian Aborigines can testify. Likewise domestic violence itself is not only limited to minority ethnic groups.This is easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen. So if you haven't had the privilege of seeing it yet, then I highly recommend that you do so. George Henare's stirring Taiaha scene alone is well worth the cost of getting the movie out.(A Taiaha is a Maori spear. To use one of these, one must have immense mana, or importance. As Henare's character said, the British *feared* the highly skilled Taiaha warriors.)",

            "content": "As a Pacific Islander (Samoan), I could relate to the characters in this film, especially the father Jake The Muss.  As a warrior people, Islander life is hard, and it comes with the damage that was introduced to our people from European intervention back when Island people first had contact with the expeditious Europeans.The Pacific Island people of Maori, Tonga, Hawaii, Fiji, Tokelau, Easter Island, Tahiti, and Samoa to name a few, have all felt the results of European and American intervention.  This film epitomizes the lifestyle of people who were once chiefs, warriors, and royalty, and the results of the alcohol and western ways that produced characters like Jake and many Islanders like him.Our people were a race of proud warriors, and this film is powerful in it's depiction of a family torn apart due to the effect of substance abuse on the warrior and his family.  It is sad, but I can relate because I was that way with my first wife.  I drank, and confided in the comfort of my Samoan brothers placing them first before my family.  I beat my wife constantly and with little or no provocation, and was able to hold a reputation as a gang elder and fighter within my hood in Los Angeles, CA.  This ripped my family apart, as the Heke family in the story.  The guilt of my past life appeared before me when I saw the film, and even now I cringe from the life I lead 12 years ago.The depiction of Maori lifestyle is on point, as a large number of my people live in those conditions.  Among Samoans, there are more of us on mainland USA than back home.  Many Samoans (like the Maori's in the film)live in urban areas, infected with substance abuse, and gangs.  Violence is an everyday thing, and the movie depicted all of these points.  NOT FAR FROM FACT.",

            "content": "If you can find this film (we got it from Netflix) and have the stomach to watch a wife being physically abused -- and an even more grueling episode later in the film, this is a must. It is set in an urban New Zealand slum and centered on the deterioration in the marriage between a Maori princess and a handsome brute of a man who is prone to drinking for entertainment and who resorts to unbelievably brutal violence whenever he gets angry, which is often. I never heard of the actors, the director or the novel on which the movie is based. But it's gut-wrenching and extremely well done. The director is Lee Tamahori and the principal actors are Rena Owen, a beautiful woman presumably in her early 40's, as the wife, Temuera Morrison as the husband, and Manaengaroa Kerr-Bell as their 13 year-old daughter, the middle child of five. The story is taken from a novel that was a bestseller in New Zealand, and it is easy to understand why. The clash between the wife's Maori culture which rejected her brute of a husband forms the backdrop as the two eldest children, both boys and both extremely troubled, find themselves becoming immersed in their mother's historic culture. I won't say much more about the plot so as not to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but each of the key actors is utterly convincing. Violence -- not just between husband and wife -- pervades the film. No guns the way violence is mostly depicted in American films, but fists, heads, knees, feet and any bottle, wall, appliance or piece of furniture that's handy. Morrison is no one you'd want to tangle with, believe me, though he exudes a certainly manly charm as well as physical attractiveness, making Owen's sexually charged desire for him totally explicable. Kerr-Bell is splendid as a sensitive teenager who does all she can to hold the family together and is ultimately defeated by her efforts. Tamahori, a first time director, convincingly exploits the squalor of the urban setting, the beauty of the New Zealand countryside and the simplicity and dignity of the Maori \"once were warriors\" village life.",

            "content": "It's interesting watching Once Were Warriors as someone who has grown up in New Zealand and lived in a suburb where many aspects of the movie, reflected much of what I saw going on around me. Crime, poverty, substance abuse, violence including domestic violence - all were staple components of where I grew up that relate well to the themes within OWW.Ironically, seeing it on the screen seemed to me, far more real than it had ever been before - despite knowing men like Jake Heke and women like Beth. Despite being friends with people like Grace and like Nig, it never seemed as real as what it did on-screen.That is a testament to the way this film was pulled together, but also to the many talented people involved - most especially the cast. Temuera's portrayal of Jake is stunning. You will laugh with him and at him, you will swear it him and you will curse him with every ounce of your body, wanting to walk across the room and reach out for Jake and stop him from striking out at Beth ... that is, if you aren't scared of him. Temuera's portrayal somehow manages to engage you with Jake's human side, seeing the love that he has for Beth whilst also showing you the absolutely monstrous and dark side of Jake the Muss.Rena Owen meanwhile does an equally astounding performance.This movie will grab your emotions by the fistful and throw them around the room, leaving them as battered and bruised as the fragile souls of Beth and Grace Heke.This movie is highly recommended, but it is also highly recommended that you watch this when you are in a space to do so.",

            "content": "The Hekes, an urban family of New Zealand descended from Maori warriors. Beth Heke (Rena Owen) is the mother of 5 children and is the principal descendant from Maori warriors. Her husband, Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) is an alcoholic and a very violent person who likes to get drunk in his house and to beat his wife and also he has a resentment against Maori warriors because they doesn't accept him as Beth's husband. Their eldest son, Nig (julian Arahanga) is now in a gang with Maori influence; the second son, Boggie (Taungaroa Emile) is taken from his family due to some criminal offences and Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), the 13 years old daughter who suffers the most in consequence of the crisis in her family and she have to protect her younger brothers. The film follows those hard days in the life of this family and how the love of a mother can be more powerful than anything.That is the main plot of this terrific film that for me is one of the most powerful and realistic films in the 90's. The story is great and very touching and in some parts very disturbing. And the way this film is made is very realistic thanks to the superb cast full of young actors in their first role. An honourable mention to Rena Owen who makes one of the best performances in a film of the 90's and the same mention to Temuera Morrison who is just excellent in a very difficult role. The direction is superb too; is the first feature film of the director Lee Tamahori now very famous for his mediocre career in Hollywood (including the 2002 James Bond movie) and for me this is his best work until now.Conclusion: of course I can't judge the life of the descendants from Maori warriors, but their seems to be social outcast. I mean the problem in the film with the family in crisis can happen in every culture of the world but it is a sad fact that the few descendants of our cultures are treated with racism. So for me this a very touching film and one of best of the 90's, with a lot of memorable lines, unforgettable scenes (my favourite is when Beth tell to her husband: \"Our people once were warriors, but unlike you they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit; if my spirit can survive living with you for 18 years, then i can can survive anything\") and with a superb cast. 10 out of 10DVD: i hear a lot of things about this film, including a lot of positive reviews but it was until yesterday that i watch it. I found the DVD in a very low price, about $2.5 so it is a single edition without any extras. Anyway this film deserves to be in my personal collection.",

            "content": "Never, ever have I seen anyone in such a constant and consistent rage as Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) in this movie. The violence he dishes out is perhaps even more intimately visceral than that of Ed Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, in \"American History X\". At one point in the story, his daughter Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell) states - \"People show their true feelings when they're drunk\". If so, Jake's true feelings were not only inspired by his dependence on alcohol, but fueled by it to an astonishing degree. And like all true bullies and cowards, he blames his wife Beth (Rena Owen) for his daily outbursts. That she was a battered wife doesn't even come close to describing her condition as Jake's regular punching bag. Any one of Jake's fearsomely delivered fists would have been enough to end her life and early on, that's where I thought the story might be headed.This is a film that will leave you drained with all of it's violence, and yet it never seems over the top or forced, but the reaction of a man out of control of his own life and that of his family. The scene in which Grace is violated by her own uncle compels the viewer to try and figure out how and when it will become more generally known, and it's with a certain sense of satisfaction that for once, Jake's fearsome energy is directed at one of his own mates. Which is not to say that it leaves the viewer satisfied that Jake may have finally seen the light. As Beth leaves for her former family's safe haven, any sense of remorse or guilt on Jake's part is undeniably lacking. As a person, he will never be fulfilled.This will probably not be an easy watch for a lot of folks. There are more than a handful of cringe worthy scenes, usually with Beth on the receiving end. It is with the utmost relief that the film comes to a close with Beth's commitment to leave Jake forever, her remaining children more supportive than they've ever been. \"We're going home\" never sounded better than at the close of this tragic story.",

            "content": "Once Were Warriors follows the experiences of a Maori family living in poverty in New Zealand. Jake Heke is an abusive husband who regularly gets drunk and hits his wife, Beth, whistle at the same time it is still apparent that he does need his wife and children. Beth is the long suffering abused wife who tries to see the good in Jake even though she knows what he does is wrong. Nig is about to join a violent gang whistle boogie is always getting in trouble with the police and is close to being sent to a children's home. Finally Grace is the one person who has not been affected by Jakes violence, however, Grace suffers an excruciatingly painful ordeal that will change her and her family forever.Lee Tamahori directed Once Were Warriors in 1994, a time in which women were beginning to disperse the male-dominated society. The issue of domestic abuse is candidly approached without portraying Beth as a stereotypically abused wife. Lee Tamahori also expertly manages to ensure that Jake is not viewed as another stereotypical, immoral abusive husband.The film also deals with social and economical circumstances within a working class Maori culture in New Zealand. Although they are both of Maori descent, Jake and Beth had very different backgrounds. Jake was a working class man with no real expectations and Beth was a Maori tribal princess. The viewer is reminded of their differences at many points during the film so we can see how different they are.Once Were Warriors is crammed full of effective cinematic devices that allow the viewer to really enjoy the film. The audience is treated to an abundance of different camera angles to reflect the different attitudes and values presented in the film. Lee Tamahori also uses different kinds of music to reflect the emotions of the characters, E.G when Jake is getting angry, we hear a low humming sound and when the whole family is together and happy, a happy and uplifting song is played.Lee Tamahori has created a groundbreaking masterpiece that has the power to amaze and shock audiences time and time again. However, the real credit must go to the two main actors, Rena Owen and Temeura Morrison. Rena Owen plays Beth with such a convincing performance that the audience actually believes her as Beth and not just a patronising, na\u00efve actor. Temeura Morrison portrays Jake as a complex character that has many other issues and problems besides the drinking and getting angry. Unlike many other actors, Temeura Morrison does not play Jake as a stereotypical abusive husband, which is part of the reason why Once Were Warriors is so powerful and effective. The chemistry between Rena Owen And Temeura Morrison is so compelling, that together, with the amazing screenplay by Alan Duff and direction of Lee Tamahori, successfully render Once Were Warriors one of the most potent and shocking films of the 1990's",

If you have ever been in a relationship that is so violent like this one, you will relive it to the point of near panic when you know that moment that Jake will blow up.This is absolutely one of the best films I've ever seen. This is the first time I have ever written down who the actors were so that I could check them out and see what else they were in. The group that Nig was in were the most frightening men I have ever seen. They make Hells Angels look pretty meek & mild.I felt for the New Zealand natives. This film showed their pride and that the Warrior Spirit is not dead. And unfortunately shows the prejudices that still plague our world and morph into hatred and anger.I was so impressed with the actors and didn't once think of them as acting. There were wonderful things happening and there were tragic things happening. The children's pain was real,the fathers rage was electric. My emotions were so raw that I found myself holding my breath in fear they would know I was watching! Every once in awhile a great movie rolls along, and as usual, it rolls in quietly and unassuming and hits you like a lightening bolt! This is that one movie for me. Everyone should see this film!!!!!",

            "review_title": "The review I did in English",
            "content": "For a movie watched in Year Twelve English, Once Were Warriors, directed by Lee Tamahori, was surprisingly moving. With a top notch cast including Temuera Morrison and Cliff Curtis, the acting is fantastic and goes hand in hand with the tightly scripted pace, which led to an thought-provoking one hundred and two minutes of film.Once Were Warriors tells a story familiar to many New Zealand families. Set in 1994, against the backdrop of Otara, Auckland, it tells the story of Beth and Jake Heke. Jake is an all round under achiever with a nasty temper and a fondness of beer. He likes to be the king of his state-house castle and his local pub, The Royal. Beth is the strong willed runaway who married Jake against her tribe's wishes. She loves Jake enough to forget the price he is having on her family - Nig, Boogie, Grace, Polly and Huata. Nig is the oldest boy, and hates his father for abusing Beth; his hate leads him to join the TOA gang. Boogie is also getting into trouble and Grace has turned to writing as an escape from her lout of a father. This story forces Beth to confront her husband's violence, and decide which is more important; his \"needs\" or her family.The performances in this movie were superb. Temuera Morrison is excellent as Jake Heke. He is convincing as both the \"lovable chap\", when he and Beth sing 'The Nature of Love', and a frightening monster, when he beats Beth. In the final scene, he is incredible! Despite his violent words (he uses one expletive 17 times in less than 30 seconds), Morrison manages to display a kind of brokenness, that made me feel pity for him despite his previous actions, which most viewers would agree were appalling. Rena Owens was also extraordinary as the vibrant and resilient Beth Heke. She is totally believable. She is Beth. Her acting is incredibly varied. Owens shows Beth's vulnerability. After Jake's beating, she is weak and injured which is a total contrast to the last scene where she is strong even the face of Jake's fury, coming back with \"Our people once were warriors. But unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit. If my spirit can survive living with you for eighteen years, then I can survive anything\". The performances of Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell (Grace), Shannon Williams (Toot) and Sonny Arahanga (Nig) were also exceptionally moving. Basically, there were very few performances in this movie unworthy of a standing ovation.Another really positive aspect of Once Were Warriors was the setting. Tamahori's aim was to produce a tough, gritty, urban-based drama, which showed the destructiveness of urban life-style. You don't get much more urban in New Zealand than Otara. The film has amazing contrasts in it with setting. As a New Zealand movie, you expect beautiful mountains, hills, lakes, the clean and the green, and the beautiful first shot sets the scene for such things. When you see it's just a billboard and that the closest the Hekes have to that ideal is the dead-looking tree in their backyard, it reinforces that idea of the country as a nurturing place. Even the lighting and colors of the places help with this. Otara is dark, shabby, and gray. There's no color in their home or in their lives. The Marae, set in the country, by a beautiful lake, is bathed in golden light, symbolic of the joy and color within them at this time.There was a lot of good stuff about this movie but it also had its down points. There was a lot of violence which is important to the story, but was a little too graphic and hard to watch for some of the people in my class. It also tends to present the view that all Maori people are constantly drunk and swearing; that none have jobs or cars; and that all they do is drink, have parties and beat and rape people. The only ones that don't live on Maraes. This movie deals with the huge international issue of domestic violence, and although the Heke family is Maori, these are issues which affect all races and societies. It also shows the power and beauty of the Maori culture, and makes you understand that Jake is not the ideal role- model for any society.This movie IS good, but don't be under the impression it's a \"feel good\" favorite that you'd like to gather your family around for a light evening of entertainment. This movie is basically a tell-all on domestic violence. It shows violence as the ugly thing it is. Once Were Warriors is not for fun, this is a drama that really makes you think, discuss, confront and actually do something about problems in your society. It is a worthwhile watch, if you can approach the film with an open mind.",

            "content": "I picked this film up for my girlfriend who had mentioned that she saw it a few years ago and really liked it. I didn't really think much of it until I sat and watched it - and I'm really glad I did. ONCE WERE WARRIORS is an EXTREMELY powerful and moving film about a poor New Zealand Maori family who is being torn apart by alcoholism, abuse, and the surroundings/environment that they live in.Jake (the father) is a heavy-drinking, working-class, tough-guy - who spends more time at the bar with his mates than at home with his family. When he is home, he is usually either passed out drunk or has all his mates over to party and basically tear sh!t up. Jake also has a violent temper and doesn't mind knockin' the ol' lady around when he's fired up...Beth is a loving but emotionally-damaged mother and wife whose own demons get the best of her and keep her from doing what's right for her family. She is also into the sauce and has long since lost control of her family and her own life...Nig (the oldest son) has just joined a violent gang and has not time nor interest in his family...Grace (the oldest daughter) is a sweet and creative girl with aspirations of being a writer, but her surroundings and constant negative environment make any sort of hope for a better life nearly impossible...The youngest son, Mark (aka Boogie) is in with the wrong crowd and constantly gets into petty trouble, to the point that he gets sent away and becomes a ward of the state...There are two younger children as well, but we only see them in passing and they don't play any huge roles in the film.ONCE WERE WARRIORS centers around this extremely dysfunctional family - and Beth's weak attempts to hold them together despite all the negative influences that constantly surround all of them, and that they allow to remain in their lives. Jake and his drinking, partying, and uncaring attitude towards his wife and family make it impossible for them to dig themselves out of their pitiful situations, and lead to some truly heart-wrenching and sickening consequences - and Beth's lack of protest and refusal to leave this bad situation only makes matters worse - leaving the children stuck in the middle.OWW is a powerful and emotional film that is very realistic in it's depiction of poverty, abuse, addiction, and hopelessness. But this film is not nihilistic or mean-spirited. At the heart of it is a story of hope against all odds, and in this sense is inspiring. OWW is in many ways hauntingly beautiful and strangely funny. Jake for example is as big a dick as they come - but he can also be amusingly charming and witty - when he's not drinking. Although the subject matter is completely different, OWW reminds me of the Brazian films, CARANDIRU and CITY OF GOD (2 other excellent films...) in terms of it's stark and honest portrayal of poverty and it's effects on people. Definitely one of the emotionally strongest films I've seen in quite a while. Highly Recommended - 10/10",

I remember sitting in my chair shaking with fury (anger simply does not describe the emotion) over the injustice of the scene were Grace fetches a glass of water, I almost cried over the scene with the tree and the rope and had difficulty remaining seated to what followed the notebook being glued together.I live in antipode of the set, in a completely different situation and society but the story still touches me deeply.

            "content": "This New Zealand film revolves around unemployed Maori, Jake \"the Muss\" Heke and his neglected family. Jake and crew live in a low income housing area surrounded by stray dogs, wire fences and piles of garbage. Jake is an alcoholic wife beater, and right from the start you are shown just how ugly and mean a man can be.This is a graphic journey into the dangers of living below the poverty line in a bad area and the negative effect it has on a family's life. Jake and wife Beth (an unforgettably strong performance by Rena Owen) have 5 children: Nig, Gracie, Mark and 2 younger children who play a very small role. Nig has joined a vicious gang and disowned his father, Mark is taken into social welfare after a court hearing and Gracie is the shinning beacon in this bleak movie. Grace is an intelligent, thoughtful and caring girl who stands by her mother and helps her siblings as best she can, whilst her father drinks, shouts and beats his way through his miserable life.Jake's family suffer under him, most of all his wife, who seems to be on the receiving end of his short temper throughout the film. There is a brutal and violent scene during a drunken house party, where Jake beats his wife to a pulp for refusing to cook eggs for Jake's friend \"Uncle Bully\", you even see her blood on the walls and doors the next morning!!. Beth still sticks with Jake through the violence and appalling behaviour, a point is made that she still loves him, below the tattoo'd beast there is a man she loves.Things take a further descent when Gracie commits suicide by hanging herself in the back garden. It is at this point that Jake and Beth cut ties over their daughters death, after a tense and upfront confrontation in their kitchen. Gracie is then sent off in a traditional Maori funeral in Beth's home village, Gracie's family are all there, all apart from Jake who is drowning his sorrows over another beer.Things come to a climax when Beth discovers Gracie's reason for suicide whilst reading her scrapbook ( a book which Jake earlier ripped apart after Grace answered him back). Beth goes straight to Jake's bar to put some wrong things right...and I couldn't have wished for a better ending.This isn't a pleasant film to watch, but it is powerful and gripping enough to keep you watching till the last minute.",

            "content": "Once Were Warriors (1994) is a movie from New Zealand, directed by Lee Tamahori.I have no expertise about the race situation in New Zealand. Based on what's shown in the movie, the non-Europeans in New Zealand are in the same marginalized situation as Native Americans in the U.S.Not only that, but there is a division within the non-European community between those that participate fully in the Maori culture, and those that exhibit only passing reference to that culture.In the latter group is Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison). The main pastimes of Jake and his friends are drinking beer and fighting. As it happens, Jake excels at fighting, so he seeks out opportunities to hit people. These people include other men in bars, but also his wife.Rena Owen portrays Beth Heke, who is married to Jake and mother of his five children. Both of the adolescent boys have strayed from the right path. The teenaged daughter, Grace is the child who is loving and caring. (Grace is portrayed by the excellent actor Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell,)This movie is hard to watch because of the many fight scenes, and the social and personal problems that are everywhere. There's a nod to Maori pride, but I found it too little and too late.On the other hand, the film was made by a director with a skilled eye and a sure hand. It's a great movie, but not an easy one.We saw the film on VHS. It's available on DVD and streaming. It worked well on the small screen. Once were Warriors has a high IMDb rating of 7.9.

Both have a similar theme but Once Were Warriors is a much more adult and dark view of modern Maori society. Gone is the love for their heritage as seen in Whale Rider--in its place a direction-less existence filled with violence, crime and substance abuse.Like some American Indians, the characters in this film are clearly alcoholics and extremely violent. It is a sobering thought that when a way of life is lost, so goes all sense of honor and purpose. A particular standout in the film is the actress that played the mother--she really showed a diverse range of emotions and made me truly believe she was a real character.There is very little I didn't like or respect about the movie--it was marvelous. However, it is VERY IMPORTANT to point out that this is NOT a film for children!! Due to its sobering message, the film is jam packed with some of the most extreme domestic violence scenes I have ever found on film and there is a rape scene. All these are necessary for the plot, but were also quite unsettling. I admire the producer and director from not shying away from this, but it simply would not be appropriate to let a child see this film until they are about 16 or 17 at the very youngest.",

            "content": "When the opening credits screamed huge titles in your face, I thought that this was going to be one of those Grindhouse styled pictures with cheesy hilarious dialogues with over the top acting and swear words flying all over. In fact, the first few minutes established all that coupled with a very edgy score, but Grindhouse this is not, instead, it has all the trappings of a solid drama, and deals with very mature adult themes and of family.This is a very different New Zealand that someone from the outside will take to. Gone are the picturesque postcard scenes, and in are the gritty, grimy neighbourhoods where families at the poverty line struggle to make a living. The story, based upon a novel by Alan Duff, centers on the Heke family, who are of Maori descent. And things are rosy at home as Mom Beth (Rena Owen) has 5 kids to take care of, in which Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) is going to be sentenced in juvenile court, and eldest Nig (Julian Arahanga) seeking a home away from home with gangs. The only and possibly sensible one is with Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), who assists her mom in shepherding her youngest siblings from the explosive behavior of father Jake (Temuera Morrison) who has a penchant for violence when he has too much to drink.Sounds like a typical family melodrama all set up, and it is, except that this was delivered with such realism that you'll cringe at the sight of unflinching violence. It's hard to sit through it, leaving you seething with rage as the victims find it difficult to leave and make changes to their lives. Once Were Warriors chronicles this struggle, and your emotions go on a roller coaster as you root for various characters to break out of their zone of discomfort, and to challenge the norms in order to stand up for themselves. The first time Jake rages in the movie undoubtedly sets the tone for the rest of the story, because slivers of hope get evaporated by the time you see how the make up artists work on Beth to bring to you the sheer madness.The character of Jake is peculiarly intriguing, as for someone who got laid off and without a job, he's satisfied to just be on welfare, and what more, to spend those money on drink and gambling, though drawing the line on women. After hours late night parties at his home with his \"pals\" also seem the norm to sooth his ego as being the all round nice guy. And when things don't go his way, the only way he knows how to deal with it, is by his fists, where he takes pride in dispatching trouble makers in bars, unknowing that he too is trouble for his own family. Quite a tragic character really, for his clueless behaviour in not knowing how to take care of his family properly, being constantly disengaged from his wife and children, which naturally awaited for some tragedy to happen. On the other hand, one can only imagine the amount of abuse that wife Beth can put up with, if not only for the sake of the children.It's interesting to see where the leads have gone off to after this 1994 movie. Temuera Morrison looked familiar, and a quick check on IMDb showed that he had portrayed Jango Fett and Commander Cody in the fairly recent Star Wars prequels. In fact, co-lead Rena Owen too had starred in the prequels as well. Director Lee Tamahori doesn't lag behind too, having helmed the James Bond installment Die Another Day, and xXx2.Once Were Warriors had a sequel as well called What Becomes of The Broken Hearted? which was also made into a movie, though was less well received. Personally, this is rated by me as a highly recommended movie, and watching a Haka being performed here, definitely deserved its brownie points.",

Each role is equally as hard to bring too life with the heart and soul needed from a performer but both leads are unforgettable as a couple bound together by love but torn too pieces by a constant barrage of misdemeanours that affect not only themselves but their children too.Final Say -A powerfully performed and uncompromising New Zealand drama, Once Were Warriors deserves its place at the top of the Kiwi film list as it explores and examines a deep seeded issue in the stunning island lands that continues to be prevalent to this day.4 1/2 cooking requests out of 5.",

Once Were Warriors tells a story of alcoholism, domestic abuse and poverty and all the nasty aspects of live, brought about by the patriarch of the family, Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison).The Hekes live in a run down part of town, with their home next to a motorway. Jake lost his job and he spends most of his time drinking and partying with his mates at the local bar and at his home. His wife Beth (Rena Owen) is also an alcoholic, but actually cares about her children, despite living under the constant threat of her husband's violence temper. The children too have their problems. The oldest Nig (Julian Arahanga) has joined a Maori gang whom have rituals of violence. Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) is in trouble with the police after stealing a car stereo and ends up in care. And Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell) has to act as a mother figure to the youngest two children and escape through writing stories. The family slowly disintegrates because of Jake's tyranny and uncaring nature as Beth and the children struggle through their problems bought about by this alcoholic thug.As stated this brutal tale. Director Lee Tamahori does not hold back in his direction: domestic violence is tough to watch and so realistic in nature. The domestic violence was handled with great care showing how complex the relationship between a man and a woman can be, sweet and tender one moment and then a flash of anger then next minute. It really was a pendulum of emotions. The first scene of domestic violence is so shocking and surprising, that it will knock you over. Tamahori and the screenwriter Riwia Brown expertly show the hypocrites of Jake's character when he would beat someone up if insult a woman but obviously has no problem punching his own wife. The film shows that it is a issue of control and in a way love, that is why most women don't leave straight after an attack because they feel they cannot. Jake's character was similar to Harry from Last Exit from Brooklyn (except with the homosexual plot), about a man who abuses his wife and only cares about his own enjoyment and self-interest. He should go down as one of the greatest screen villains because he is so frighteningly real. It is a tragic film because whilst Beth is tough and loves her children regardless, her husband is so domineering she ends up loosing the people she loves the most. The story about Grace having to act as a mother figure and having to grow up faster then she is meant to was well handled, touching and believable. It was easy to feel sorry for both women even though Grace grows resentful of her mother.The boys who are not as involved in the film, but they explore their Maori culture, with Nig joining a gang and having a traditional facial tattoo, whilst Boogie learns about his culture and history when he is in care. There is a whole theme throughout the film of the family looking back at their traditional culture and its fair to say that products like alcohol have destroyed indignant communities, not just in New Zealand, but also Australia and America.There is a talented cast, playing their roles with real conviction. There are all natural. Morrison is truly horrid, with Owen having mix strong and weak at different times of the film. Kerr-Bell too was good, having to balance out her characters innocence and wisdom.Tamahori does have moments of stylist direction with his opening credits, but for the most part the film is hard-hitting. Tamahori does not sugar-coat his film in any way, making the film as hard-hitting as possible. He handles all the themes with great care and allows all the aspects to shine. The film felt very much like a Social Realist British film, shot both in a similar style and tackling the same sort of themes. But as well as hard-hitting issues and violence, the funeral scene is also one of the most saddest scenes, with such a sensitive approach behind it. What is a real shame is that Tamahori could make a brilliant film like this and end up being a Hollywood hack, directing Die Another Day, xXx 2: State of the Union and Next.There should have shown more about Nig's involvement in the gang and starting to enter a world or crime and violence. But that the only real criticism.This is certainly not the New Zealand in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.",

            "content": "This story of domestic violence and abuse in a Maori family in Awkland New Zealand is strong stuff. On the one hand you have to admire it for not holding back on showing gruesome details, on the other hand it turns the stomach. I know little about the Maoris, but, from what is seen here, it looks like many have been marginalized in the same way as the American Indians and have wound up living in poverty and fighting alcoholism. In examining the lives of Jake Heke, his wife Beth, and their five children \"Once were Warriors\" acquaints us with the lives of one such marginalized Maori family, in graphic detail.At the beginning of the film Jake announces to Beth that he has just lost his job, for which Beth roundly belittles him. In a later scene Jake speaks of coming from slaves. This is where a better knowledge of the Maoris would be helpful to the ignorant such as myself. Whatever Maori slaves were it seems clear that they constituted a lower class and this is essential in understanding Jake and his relationship with Beth, who came from more noble ancestors. In one pivotal scene Jake, in front of Beth and his three daughters, says in a disgusted self-negating way, \"You know where I come from kids? A long line of slaves. F****** slaves.\" Given the sources of Jake's humiliations, it is not difficult to understand macho aggressiveness as being his way of getting some respect. Even though he ultimately pays the price for his self-destructive violent behavior, and in some ways could be viewed as a tragic figure, I could never get beyond seeing him simply as a savage animal. His explosive temper hangs over this movie in a way that perhaps gives you a small sense of what it would be like to deal with such a person on a daily basis. Never knowing when he will explode, or what will provoke him, keeps you on edge.The children react to their environment in individual ways. One joins a Maori gang, another winds up involved with learning the ways of his more noble ancestors, and another wants to become a writer. A tragic event involving the oldest daughter precipitates actions that may save the children from being caught in a self-perpetuating downward spiral.I came away from viewing this movie thinking that racism, class differences, and religious distinctions are so universally prevalent and corrosive that it may never be possible to have a truly harmonious multicultural society.",

            "content": "Considering his recent troubles, the media has been sure to hammer home all the sordid details of director Lee Tamahori's problems, and the fact that he directed DIE ANOTHER DAY, while completely overlooking that the man is a brilliant talent in search of another project that measures up to ONCE WERE WARRIORS, his devastating and heart-rending debut.If you need a startling reminder of what a towering talent he possesses, you need look no further than this. The film is twelve years old, and yet hasn't lost one whit of its ability to shock, mesmerize and rip emotions from you unlike any domestic drama that has preceded it. This is no KRAMER VS. KRAMER, no SHOOT THE MOON. It's more like SOPHIE'S CHOICE meets DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES by way of BOYZ 'N' THE HOOD, and even with this incredibly unlikely comparison, you're still not there yet. This movie is virtually in its own unique genre.Rena Owen was nominated for an Oscar, and rightfully so, in the role of Beth Heke. A proud and beautiful woman of Maori heritage, as is her entire family, she's also a woman battling her own proclivities toward weakness as she struggles heroically to hold her fractured family together. She is the matriarchal figure, but she hardly rules the roost. That responsibility falls to her husband, Jake, (Temuera Morrison in an electrifying performance that establishes him as New Zealand's answer to the late Oliver Reed), a brutish hulk of a man with as many contradictions of character as he has muscles in his huge biceps. He is capable of being a strong leader, a great father and a loving, playful, tender, even sexy guy, and it's a side he shows to Beth that also helps the audience understand what the hell it was that made her fall in love with him...and why she stays. But it's also a side he doesn't show enough, especially when he's knocked back a few at the local pub...which usually follows with him knocking Beth around, and anybody else stupid or unfortunate enough to get in his way.But the Hekes' situation is a lot more complicated than just domestic violence on a nearly daily basis. Tamahori and writer Riwia Brown, working from Alan Duff's novel, are careful to make sure that all the characters are three-dimensional, but more than that, they vividly establish the edge-of-impoverished conditions in which the family and many Maori families like them struggle to survive in every day, (not unlike in the reservations for Native Americans here, only without the fences and boundaries), and how the socioeconomic situation affects the decisions made by everyone, and their nearly-fatalistic outlook on life in general.As another reviewer mentioned, boiled down to its basic essence, it it a wrenching story of a mother's hope for her family and how she wants to make a better life for them all with her spouse's help, whenever he's sober and not trying to break her neck.The family dynamic and the escalating cycles of desperation, intoxication and violence set the stage for a much needed but tragic catharsis, when a nearly unspeakable act of assault leads finally to death, and the family, now completely shattered, finally reaches out to one another to help begin to pick up the pieces. That's as much as I can say without going into spoiler details and ruining the whole thing. Make sure you have Kleenex in reserve...this is anything but an easy ride.Besides Owen and Morrison, the casting of actors mostly unknown to American audiences is a revelation; their performances here are all memorable. Julian Arahanga (of the excellent BROKEN English) and Taungaroa Emile are breathtaking as the elder and younger Heke brothers, very much their father's sons--steeped in their proud Maori heritage and equally conflicted by it as they confront the challenges of their hopeless surroundings and an uncertain future at best, and the wonderful and woefully overlooked Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell as younger sister Grace, with whom Beth has entrusted her greatest expectations of hope for the future, and who is the one truly calming influence in a chaotic sea of familial misery.This is NOT, I repeat, NOT a \"date\" movie. It's also not your average domestic drama. If you've seen the difficult NIL BY MOUTH, another excellent yet emotionally draining piece, that may have served as an adequate warm-up for WARRIORS. But be warned: no mere comedy will chase away the after-effects of a film where the director may have very well been channeling some demons of his own, while documenting the destructive effects such an endeavor wreaks on a family that is both noble and needy by turns.This one will haunt you for a while, trust me.",

With that said, what we knew about Maori culture was brought to a realistic light and stripped completely of it's stereotypes. If you're looking for a film about beaches, fruity drinks, torches, and surfing, this is not the film. Once Were Warriors is an explosively moving and utterly devastating portrait of a Maori family squandered by poverty, tormented by a violent and misogynistic monster of a father, and trapped in the armpit of New Zealand; an industrial urban nightmare filled with violent outcasts of Maori tribes. In the midst of the chaos, we're introduced to an array of deep characters, some incredibly evil and others astonishingly beautiful. Without spoiling anything more, it's quite easy to say that Once Were Warriors is one of the most powerful and moving depictions of family, as well as a powerful (yet very sad and even disturbing) parable on conquering the forces of violence and cruelty with love and unity.10/10",

            "content": "\"Once Were Warriors\" is a truly amazing film - one that appears in my 'Favourite' Top 20 films of all time - and I feel somewhat special that I live in the country that made this awesome movie.Family abuse and violence are nothing new, here in New Zealand - there were 8 children beaten to death last year alone because of abusive parents - and this movie shows this without any flaws.Temuera Morrison (most commonly-known to NZ's as Dr. Hone Ropata on 'Shortland Street', or known in the States to have appeared in movie flops like 'Barb Wire' and 'Speed II: Cruise Control') is brilliant as the violent-father Jake The Muss, and Rena Owen's performance as Beth Heke is so moving and powerful, you'd swear she wasn't just an actress.Incredibly moving, and heart-touching, 'Once Were Warriors' deals with very touchy subjects (like rape, violence, drugs, gangs...etc) that a lot of other movies couldn't display well enough.Alan Duff wrote the novel of it. Being Maori himself, he believes that all children (especially in New Zealand, and especially Maori children) should have a loving home (as well as an education) and has written several books about topics such as these.To 'kramer-22', who dubbed 'Once Were Warriors' the \"worst movie ever\" - there is something truly wrong with you. And while you can't sit through these kinds of criminal offences, \"O.W.W\", in no way glorifies them - it shows what can happen to families with these kinds of problems.In closing, I'd like to say 'thanks' to all those who made this truly excellent film. You've taken a very hard subject to write about, brought it to life, and shown a very powerful message. 9.5/10",

            "content": "The chances are a majority of us have never heard of ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Those who have come across this movie will always be able to recall this movie ages down the line. The powerful message of domestic violence and the struggle for survival is something once watched in ONCE WERE WARRIORS cannot be forgotten. I was told of this movie quite by chance whilst in conversation of the \"greatest movies of the 90s\". Curiosity always gets the best of me and I am grateful I was able to find a copy of this title.The relevance of the message discussed in ONCE WERE WARRIORS to me seems more appropriate today than it would have been almost 2 decades ago. The significance of the Maori tribe is irrelevant in the discussion of its message. Director Lee Tamahoris' intention of portraying the powerful Maori descendants is in no way an indication that the theme discusses the Maori way of life. Instead it speaks of the way of life of the poor in the world. In a time where natural disasters are at a record high, man-made weapons of mass destruction have the potential of destroying all earthly life and at a time where poverty is increasing more rapidly than it can be fought; this theme could not be more appropriate.Set in an unnamed city in Southern Auckland, New Zealand, Beth Heke (Rena Owen) and her family struggle to meet their basic necessities. Beth who looks after her 5 children along with her husband Jake lives an ordinary life. Ordinary has a very peculiar subtext in ONCE WERE WARRIORS. Ordinary in the M\u0101orian way of life is a hard day's work, a couple of beers that follow with the whole community carrying the drinking to one particular house until the drinking can go on no more. To some of us viewers this life may seem wrong, however I personally feel it's beautiful to see how people manage to smile through all the hardships of life even with the help of alcohol. The only unbalanced medium in this fine equation of poverty and happiness is the temper that Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) carries along with him. Jake loves his family dearly; however under the influence of alcohol he is an uncontrollable monster that is yearning to be released. Jake has very little tolerance and respect to those around him once he is provoked. May it be wife, child or friend Jake would not hesitate to throw his arms around! He packs a punch meaner than Jason Statham of today!The success in ONCE WERE WARRIORS is most certainly her talented cast. Rena Owen puts up a performance that I personally will remember a life time. An actress who has been called one of the most talented actress of her time indeed is worthy of such praise. None will say otherwise once you have seen her in this. The most touching moment is when Rena Owens holds her deceased daughter in her arms in her own back yard; I broke down into tears when I felt her pain. The mix is perfect with Temuera Morrison who stars by Owens side. How these two performances were not acknowledged at the Oscars during its time is question I could not find an answer to.With over 19 awards to its name ONCE WERE WARRIORS is certainly amongst the top 50 movies of the 90s!

            "content": "This film tells the story of a Maori family in New Zealand that live in a violently chaotic household until a tragic suicide forces them to make some much needed changes. Powerful, ironic, tragic, moving, deep but always well acted and real. Each person has a distinct multi-dimensional personality. In fact the films seems to thrive on the idea of duality. The father, Jake the Muss, is a man's man. He beats up the tough guy trouble makers in the bar, throws parties at his place and sings duets with his wife Beth. But this is only to make the reality all the harsher. Jake beats his wife brutally and without mercy when he gets drunk and she defies him in any way. The long suffering Beth, one of the toughest women in cinema, is made of iron, mentally and physically. She allows her children to suffer in this situation along side her and you wonder why. The answer turns out to be an act of defiance not of submission, making her character even deeper than she was previously thought. And Grace the young, imaginative, sensitive daughter who makes the ultimate sacrifice that in the end helps her family find redemption. There are many parts of the film where you want to scream at the characters. Push them to do something or to deter them from doing something, to change an already plotted course and this is a sign of a great film, one that will neither let you sit on your laurels or remain without an opinion. The film has dual layers. It can be seen as a shallow (but still amazing) film about an abusive husband and the tragic outcome or a deeper more disturbing film about the result of losing cultural identity and your link to the past. In the end you see truly human characters that expose so much humanity it becomes a bit hard to watch. This is a must see film and it will stay with you a long time.",

The story, while dark, is beautiful and uplifting at the end. I guess if you've never really known anyone who's gone through things like this, it might be hard to relate to. Rena Owens deserves an oscar, that woman can wear pain on her face like no other. So bottom line, if alcohol abuse, spousal abuse, rape, poverty, suicide are triggers, not for you.",

ONCE WERE WARRIORS is intense, gripping, powerful, compelling, and is at times difficult to watch. In essence, it is a story of suffering and redemption that simply should not be missed.Rena Owen is effective and flawless as the female lead, and symbolises the latent Maori Warrior Spirit in every scene in which she appears, regardless of the trials and tribulations she goes through. The audience will find themselves rooting almost exclusively for her character as she tries to protect her family from the moral decay that has engulfed so many. Temuera Morrison is also effective as the male lead, a man who has come from a line of slaves, and who still remains \"a slave to the drink, and a slave to his fists\". Kudos must also go to Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell in her debut performance.It is worth mentioning that is one of the few films to showcase the Maori way of life, and it is easy to imagine how some aspects of the culture will be lost upon Western societies. The portrayal of the Maori and New Zealand culture is as accurate as possible, as Lee Tamahori went to great lengths to make sure that these aspects remained untouched. As said earlier, this film is simply a must-see. 3.5 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 150 at 130. Highly recommended.",

The movie is powerful and gritty and has plenty of violence - not the Hollywood \"shoot-em-up\" type but pretty realistic bashings. However, that isn't what the film is about, rather it deals with emotions, aspirations and motivations within a racially defined society, but it is not about racial disharmony and despite appearances the underlying message is positive - \"this is were we're at, but it's not really where we want to be, we can change things so let's try to do so\". The source book by Alan Duff was equally effective and should have universal appeal (it didn't get distributed in America, however).

While Beth was proud of being part of her great past, Jack on the other hand hated it by seeing himself as a slave. I believe there is where all his hate and aggression started.The most adorable character in this family was their 13 years old daughter, where in the beginning of the movie she was under the tree telling her younger siblings a story about a woman who sacrificed herself to safe the society. The last moments of her life were exactly under the same tree where she killed herself. I see her death as a triumph more than anything else. She suffered a lot in her family, first with her unstable parents, and after being raped by her own uncle. She now doesn't see any green light for herself in life, and wants at least to help her family through her death.And that is what really happened. After her death things at home were much different than before.

I was impressed by the powerful story and the entire cast but completely amazed by Morrison, who dominates the screen with his searing performance. He plays a descendant of the once-mighty Maoris of New Zealand, whom modern times have reduced to the squalor of urban poverty. Like his Maori pals, Morrison's character goes on the public dole, idling his time away drinking and carousing at his favorite bar, where he fights with the savage fury of his warrior ancestors. At home he's a \"good-time Charlie,\" who sings and strums his guitar for a house full of friends until provocation turns him into a beast again, raging and becoming physically abusive to his long-suffering wife and children. The sheer energy Morrison brings to his role is awesome, but what makes this performance so special is the huge, tender-to-terrifying range of emotions he commands. He makes you feel the frustration of a powerful man who starts to \"lose it\" when things don't go his way and whose strength and attempts at intimidation only make things worse. Clearly he's a perfect symbol for modern Maoris, whose elaborate tattoos, pumped-up physiques and fierce temperament at once embody the warrior ways and put them at odds with modern times. This is a must-see movie. Sci-fi fans may recognize Morrison as bounty hunter Bobba Fett from the \"Star Wars\" films, tho' he's quite a bit heavier in \"Warriors.\"",

Just like in today's society where they black people are kept down they are done so by poor education. I've always believed that if we better our public education and give needy children the attention they deserve we would spend less time filling our Prisons. It reminds me of the book Utopia in a way.How can people better themselves if they don't know any better? We're just breeding our own criminals by denying them the education they deserve. If you look at Jake and his son Nig, all they know is their body... all they know is violence. Violence begets violence. However the mother, a royal/smart one... who passes more of herself in Grace then all of them. Grace was the light in all the darkness. She helped her brothers and was more a mother than a sister. When Boogie was brought to social care, it was Grace who told Boogie to try and see that it wasn't that bad and at least he got something different. She was an optimpist, until Uncle Bully took it all away.I had to do a double take while watching this movie. Was this my life? It seemed to be so close and ring true to what I've been through. I would identify with Grace Heke's character. A young girl growing up in a world of violence, alcohol, drugs, sexual molestation, and rape. The difference between Grace and myself was that I had someone to talk to in order to work out my anger, depression, and frustration.My optimism was the only thing ever keeping me going... there has to be something better than the Sh*t that I'm going through. It's always darkest before dawn... there has to be light at the end of the tunnel. The only light there was for Grace was home with her people, her mother's people.Even with her life taken, I still don't think her father quiet got it. I think he was avoiding his own guilt my displacing his anger and sadness on everyone but himself, it's Uncle Bully's fault, it's Beth's fault, Beth's family's fault... everyone but him... Jake the Muss could never do no wrong! HA!",

Where i grew up i was one of very few Maori in the area... i remember being 7 years old in primary school when i noticed there were only two other \"brown\" kids in the whole school (and one of them was my brother)... so all my friends we're pakeha (white.european)having said that... i was always raised as a maori, complete with language, history, culture and i sense of where i belong in the world... not society, but the world (i belong anywhere i choose in society, but i'm such i small piece of the world... a valuable piece)anyway... i went to opening night with a group of people who's contact with Maori was what they saw on the news or what they read in the paper (most of it negative)... they had little idea of the fact the fact that i am very proud to be a maori and that being Maori is a large part of who i am... they left the movie with a new view on Maori life... they tried to be so understanding, and so supportive of what Maori people must go thru... it made me sicki remember being mad when i watched this movie... for the simple reason that the movie only portrayed two types of maori. neither of them in a particularly positive light. It annoyed me, because i knew that this movie wouldn't do anything to dispel the stereotype surrounding modern maori. especially the urban Maori... sure the movie portrayed a very small part of the Maori community accurately... but it is such a small part of that community. This is a stereotype that young maori men have been trying to shake for years, and now it is being put in the spotlight in a movie that was sure to be seen worldwide.I was willing to forgive and forget with this movie and move and appreciate it for what it is... a great movie but after reading posts on this board and others... i'm not sure... i will put this movie high on a shell somewhere... i might look at it from time to time, but i don't think i'll watch again for a while. i see people are still confused about the Maori people... and this film isn't helping.i would be happier if the emphasis on the \"Maori\" aspect of the movie wasn't so prevalent. as posted here... this could be anywhere, anyone, anytime... please don't think you know Maori issues because you have see a movie about a small minority... we fight a battle of racism, stereotype and discrimination every day... and when maori life is highlighted like this in media or a brown face does something wrong on the news we lose a small amount of ground in that fight.this is a people problem... not a maori people problem maybe we Once Were Warriors... but we are still proud, beautiful and full of mana... actually, i'm still a warrior, the battle has changed.i think of that night at the movies and am glad i never see those people... the discussing they had on way home still amazes me... \" i know a maori, and it's just like that... he comes to school bleeding all the time and he never has any lunch\"no... you don't know a Maori... and he's sitting right next to you.",

            "content": "A long time ago, maybe 10 years, I stumbled across this movie while looking for something to watch on TV late at night. It was one of those movies that the movie channel in my old country would hide late late at night, with no reruns during the day, I'm assuming because of the mature themes of it. I forgot the specifics of the movie, of the story, but the strong performances and some powerful scenes stayed with me.A few weeks ago I watched the movie again, this time during a film class. I didn't recognize the title when the professor introduced it, but from the very start of the film it all came back to me, and I was surprised to see that some reactions stayed the same while I saw different scenes in different light.The core of the movie, the story, is still beautiful. The pride that the Maoris have of their culture and history, and the way it is presented in the movie, is very inspiring. The scenes of domestic abuse, of the rape, are still shocking and infuriating. But even though I felt then, as I do now, that this is not something Beth should have let happen, not to her and not to her kids, I found myself now sympathizing with her and gaining some kind of an understanding of why she acts the way she does. Grace's way of dealing with her rape was something that I couldn't understand before, but now I could see her action in a different light, maybe get into her head a little to see what made her do it, beside the obvious reason.This movie shows the audience a different culture, one that is rarely viewed on screen by a mainstream American audience. We might say that we would have acted differently, wouldn't have allowed things to go on the way they do in the movie, but this is a different time in a different country. This is a glimpse at how life goes on where things aren't always easy, but where your heritage, your pride, has a way of making it tolerable.",

These people were basically striped of their culture, their language and traditions, but somehow their spirit lived on.The character Jake the Muss is terrifying and at the same time you almost feel sorry for him. I say almost because he is a horrible person with almost no chance of redemption.

The sad reality of Once Were Warriors is that we feel this is a regular occurrence, and that the members of the Heke family have come to expect these incidents and normalise them within their daily routine, even as no wife should ever have to endure such things and no child should ever have to listen to them. The film's opening serves as the beginning of another cycle. Beth is a mother that is still fiercely beautiful, but perhaps has been weathered and aged by the torment she has had to endure. Is there a hint of this in the smile as she sees Jake come home? Rena Owen hides it very well, as if she is hopeful that today is the day things will change. The film also serves as a catalyst point for each of the older Heke children, and the direction in which they are headed. The viewer is made invested with each of Nig, Grace and Boogie's journeys, as Beth desperately tries to ensure that they are not caught up in their father's wrath like she is continually. Grace's arc is the pivotal point which shatters the cycle, but it is sad that it takes her suicide to finally set it in motion. Nig, the eldest son and the one who most physically resembles his hulking, brutish father, joins a gang and takes part in a violent initiation ceremony...in some alternate timeline it seems almost certain that he end up in the same situation as his father does. But he gains the strength and resilience to stand up to him, instead of merely walking away in disgust. Boogie's story-line is the least developed of them all - there are vague aspirations about the Maori culture and a spirited haka which could have unearthed more pathos had this aspect been better explored. The strength of Once Were Warriors, and what elevates its solid script into emotional harrowing events with powerful impact is the performances from the cast. Temuera Morrison is all size and brutish strength; in his flashes of anger and violence he is terrifying, but he is also very good at deceiving us with that laid-back, New Zealander smile, and a voice which shows us glimpses of his love for song and family. Even near the end as he collapses under the weight of everything thrown at him, his innate masculinity is still trying to rear its head, still trying to drown his sorrows and pretend that nothing is wrong. Do his final words betray a fear and awareness of the wrongs he has committed? Morrison makes this possible. Owen excels in both the subtle and the overt; the blood-curdling scream as she discovers her daughter's body hanging from a tree, and in the silent, trembling fury as she fiercely attempts to \"hold her tongue\" in front of her husband. And what about Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, who treads almost silently as the beaten-down Grace, who whimpers like a helpless, abused dog as she is raped, and later shivers in the bathtub as she tries to erase physical traces of the violation but cannot scrub it from her mind. In the end there is only a little solace that she found relief from the pain, and a bittersweet feeling that it has resulted in the rest of the family finally moving away from it all.",

This is a powerful, outstandingly acted drama with a cultural context that heightens the tension. It's often hard to watch, but for those who venture in, the experience is unforgettable.When the film opens, the Heke family seems more or less ideal. Jake (Temura Morrison) is the charming husband and father who loves his wife and enjoys having a few drinks with his many friends. Beth (Rena Owen) is the housewife who loves her husband and kids. But the Hekes are not idyllic. In fact, their family is in complete disarray. Jake is a ravaging alcoholic, drinking more or less non stop 24/7. He also has a temper that is about as stable as nitroglycerin, something that Beth frequently crosses (with bloody results). Their kids are taking the brunt of their problems: Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), a writer (much to Jake's displeasure) is seeking refuge with a friend who lives alone in a rusty abandoned car smoking dope. Oldest son Nig (Julian Arahanga) has joined a gang. Younger son Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) is being placed in foster care. And the two younger kids are caught in the middle. Beth is desperately trying to keep the family together, but with a situation like this, the wounds may already be too deep to fully heal.The performances by the two leads are outstanding. I have no idea why Temeura Morrison and Rena Owen were left out of any of the major awards for 1995. Their characters are challenging, and the actors pull them off with the utmost skill. Rena Owen is the central character. She's a woman who loves her husband, but his destructive nature is ripping her family apart, and this is the last straw. If anything, the story is about Beth finding the strength to stand up to her husband...whatever the cost. Temura Morrison arguably has the most challenging role. Jake is like the Roman god Janus; on one side, he's a charming, loving husband and father. But on the other is a brutal, violent monster whose capacity for destruction has no limits. Morrison is able to show both sides of the character. Although some of the things that Jake does are horrible, there is a part of us that likes him. The children are not as central to the story, but they give solid performances.Director Lee Tamahori has made a name for himself in recent years as an action film director (although, not an especially good one...so one wonders why he hasn't taken the hint and gone back to movies like this). This film is well-made, and Tamahori is able to fully balance out the complexities of the characters and their relationships. Additionally, he has the skill not to turn this powerful story into a soap opera. It's gritty, dark, and violent (including a very disturbing scene of spousal abuse). If there's any flaw, it lacks the dramatic power to really go all the way emotionally.\"Once Were Warriors\" is an undeniably challenging film. But there is not a single person who watches it that will leave unaffected.",

It's not often that I see New Zealand films (don't think I've seen more than a handful of them) but this one impressed me as a great movie (not just a great New Zealand movie).It's the story of a dysfunctional Maori family (the Maori being the first people to settle in New Zealand-they're Pacific Islanders). The Heke family are working class and the master of the house, Jake \"The Muss\", loves his beer.Jake's teenage son is alienated from his father and Jake's wife is practically terrorised by her violent husband.Temuera Morrison as Jake gives one of the all time great performances. I've reviewed a lot of horror movies here, but Jake is one of the scariest characters ever committed to celluloid. His anger and violence are terrible to behold...truly awesome. Being a New Zealand movie, I think this movie must have gone under the radar of the Academy Award voters, though his role must have garnered some attention as he pops up in some Hollywood movies, like the Star Wars prequels.I think that the plight of the Heke family is meant to be symptomatic of the condition of the Maori in New Zealand-they're a colonised people who've not adapted or have not been allowed to adapt to the new order (or been allowed to keep their ways alive).I saw this movie before I read the original book, by Alan Duff, a Maori. The movie is truly great whereas the book is didactic in nature-perhaps functioning as a 'self-help' manual for Maoris. What's even more surprising is reading some of Duff's non-fiction work. He's an arch conservative! Thankfully the movie is content to just make great art and not get bogged down in didacticism.You hear movies like \"Heavenly creatures\" being nominated as the best New Zealand movie of all time. I've seen that and wasn't that impressed with it. \"Once were warriors\" is my pick as a great movie and the best New Zealand movie ever made (small sample, sure, but hey, it IS a GREAT movie).",

The twist of the movie took you to a whole another level. There were many shots of the house from outside as well as inside. A lot of scenes were emphasized on the house and home. The heart break in this movie was that the home was the trouble. Home is the real life's hell for the children. Jake only knew how to deal with his emotions through physical violence. It seems like his anger was always ready to explode. And it was negatively affecting his family. Even though Jake was cruel to his family, you could tell he loved his family. Grace (the daughter) was always the one telling stories and tried to bring the family together. At the end, at Grace's funeral every one was telling their own stories. The lack of education is destroying this proud Maori people in this movie. They have pride of who they are. Yet they were losing the ability to know their identity. The older son was joining the gang and it actually turned out that this particular gang was more like brother hood and proud of their heritage. I loved how the director ended the movie.

Lee Tamahori opens up the film excellently: An image of Pacific desert paradise, which turns out only to be a billboard on the side of the motorway in Auckland New Zealand, which is also the slum where all the poor Maoris live their troubled lives. The film focuses on one family of seven in particular. The mother, Beth Heke, has a sole interest of living her life with her kids and keeping it together, but that life becomes more and more dysfunctional because of the father, Jake Heke, an abusive, out of control, alcoholic fist-happy husband, nick-named Jake The Muss. He doesn't really care for his family and prefers to spend his days drinking with his friends, either at the house or in the pub. Jake beats Beth ferociously while drunk and causes her not to appear to support her son while he is sent away to a borstal for stealing cars with his mates. Nig, the eldest is in a street gang and Grace, the eldest daughter, is the only one who is innocent and not vindictive, but her innocence is shattered anyway after one of her father's friend rapes her while in bed. Violence and death consumes the whole family later on and Beth makes a decision to leave Jake once and for all.I honestly don't know why none of the main actors weren't nominated for an Oscar. Their reactions are so real and the whole film looks so genuine to how people live their lives in the slum. It's not a pretty picture, but its beautifully truthful. And I think that it really shows a good amount of optimism for the audience to see how these people live their lives and what can be done about it today.",

The oldest daughter is a smart, bookish girl who writes in her journal and keeps the younger siblings occupied while their drunk father beats the heck out of their mom.Mom comes from a royal Maori family while Dad's ancestors were slaves.  He can't forget this and won't let her forget that she's no longer amongst royalty -- that she left them for him and his kind.  She hates the life they live and the example she's setting for her kids, but she can't help loving her husband.  And he loves her.  Just as you hate watching Jake beat his wife, you are also shown his loving, sweet side.  And you end up hoping his sweet side will come back.  This is what Jake's wife and kids deal with on a daily basis.  Their issues with poverty, unemployment, drinking, abuse, violence and drugs are issues that we all deal with -- not just New Zealanders, not just Maori, not just minorities and not just poor people. One of the best movies I've ever seen.  Powerful -- even after having seen it several times.",

            "content": "I am sure that I'm not alone when I say that this film packs a punch. It is truly emotional and takes time wisely in developing the characters. We are taken through the story with a family of Maoi heritage which deals with a great wave of struggle. In addition, Jake the Muss is the most dysfunctional of the family and tends to bring them down through alcohol and violence. What makes this film so powerful are, for one, the very real and tragic events that occur. We see the father of his own family driving his wife and children away; we see his wife, Beth, struggling in her attempt to give herself a voice. One of the many powerful scenes in the movie I feel is when we see Jake's daughter, Gracie, finally being pushed to the edge where she commits suicide by hanging herself. The reason why I felt this was such a moving event in the story was because we begin to actually see the twisted works from Jake's destructive tendencies. The problem becomes more real at that point. Another aspect which contributes towards the film's effectiveness I feel is the development of Beth. At first, I saw her as a weak and simple-minded woman who posed as a lap dog and followed orders from her master: Jake the Muss. However, at the first sign of her expression, she was being too \"lippy\" and in return was brutally beaten by her husband--the living tank--Jake. After that scene, I was completely shocked! I couldn't believe that her own husband would do such a thing! Later on in the film, I found Jake even more peculiar as he would, for example, for one second be completely enraged, tearing people apart, and the next singing \"What's the Time Mr. Wolf?\". For a good portion of the movie, it had me thinking that Beth would not pull through and be strong enough to construct her own true identity as a female--especially when Jake was able to swindle and coax her into loving him again even though he beat the living \"s word\" out of her two weeks prior. All in all, though, Beth does end up finding the strength within to stand up to Jake and ends up leaving him behind in New Zealand while she and her family went back to their ideal homeland. The ending scene was truly full of impact. Jake, the seemingly ruthless and heartless beast, is completely torn inside and screams out to Beth as we see the pain of loss and deterioration of hope in his eyes.In my opinion, every single scene was necessary towards bringing the overall powerful feel to this film. This definitely is a film to be remembered. It has been one of the first to carry out a message so effectively and deeply in a long, long time. This is an amazing piece of work.",

            "content": "I'm a kiwi and once were warriors is a classic kiwi film that I definitely should have seen earlier than I did. Some of you may know Temuera Morrison, he stars as Jake Heke and he's great, but Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell steals the show as Grace Heke.I grew up fairly close to where this film takes place in south Auckland so I have a good understanding of the Heke's lives in a way. I don't understand the constant and very violent abuse that takes place in their lives, but I do understand domestic abuse just not to the same extent. Domestic abuse is a huge issue with New Zealand and so is teen suicide, often as a result of domestic abuse. It's also extremely difficult to get children out of their families to give them a proper upbringing in New Zealand, contrary to popular belief not everything is perfect here in New Zealand.Most of my criticisms are due to the technical elements of the film, and my issues with the technical elements stem from having a very low budget. This film was made for $1.6 million NZD and filmed in only 34 days. The sound design was very cheesy during some moments that are meant to be taken very seriously, these sound effects make it difficult at times. The kind of flashy cinematography I guess you could call it felt a little bit out of place in the gritty, raw environments this film is set in. The actors were also very noticeably pulling punches and holding their emotions back during some of the fight scenes. I don't actually want the actors to hit each other, but they definitely could have tried a little harder than they did.A lot of different themes like, sexism, domestic abuse, living in poverty and more are touched on in once were warriors, but to me the most interesting element that is explored is the racism that occurs between Maori who originated from slaves and Maori who originated from warriors, the Maori who once were warriors. The reason I find this so interesting is because I don't see this analysed very often and I really respect the filmmakers taking the challenge on. Usually when tackling racism in film the filmmakers take a more black and white approach (pun intended) rather than taking on a challenge like the one Lee Tamahori takes on here.There's quite a lot more I want to mention, but I'll leave it for now. Once we're warriors is a must watch film for anyone who grew up in New Zealand or has lived in New Zealand at any point in their lives. I'd recommend watching it anyway but having an understanding of the culture is definitely important to take into account. The raw portrait of my home is something I haven't seen much, that's why I found once were warriors to be so challenging and also refreshing.",

Michael Horton's editing is some of the most well known in the film industry and he shows possibly some of his best work in this film. The film, from the first shot to the last are all incredibly well done and i'm surprised it hasn't received more recognition that it has already. The urban style of this film reminds me quite a bit of Mathieu Kassovitz's french film La Haine (Hate). Despite the almost postmodern/neo feel to this film, both films have similar shots and editing feels, and try as hard as possible to accentuate the urban feel of the films, as real or fake as they may be. This film has a few problems with it, but anyone who wants to see easily the best film to come out of New Zealand/Australia region since Mad Max, you need to see this film.

After she marries him, she still continuously decides to stay with him - and not leave the relationship - despite his ongoing abuse.Her children, on the other hand, are never given a choice.

I didn't reconize the names of any of the stars, so I kept watching to see what this flick was about.  The credits to the film had almost an action/adventure/comic book feel to them, and I almost turned the channel....I'm glad I didn't.  What followed was a compelling, powerful, brutal look at the lives of a family of Maoris living in the slums of New Zealand.  The father Big Jake, in a hard drinking brawler.  The mother Beth, is a descendant of Maori royalty, who forsook her place in the tribe to marry Jake.  The sons are both ne'er do wells, but the youngest finds salvation in his Maori heritage, while the older brother finds his future in a Maori street gang.  But the soul of the movie is tragic, sensitive, Grace. The oldest daughter uses her writing to escape the brutality of her father and the dreariness of her life.  She is a better mother to her siblings, and when the \"big moment\" of the film comes, it it is shattering.  This film is....well, how do I put it?  It's disturbing, but in a good way.  You really feel for the characters, even the brutal Jake, and that's a true sign of the movie's power.  I'm glad I stayed up and watched it.",

Its sad to see that two Maori people, from different tribes that live in modern day can't get past the class issues. At one time the English were the enemies and after all that, the Maori people are using social/tribe class against each other when they should be uniting to built their culture together. After discussing this film in a film class when we watched it, one of the comments made really stuck with me. It's why did Grace really commit suicide? Was it to ease her own pain or was it a selfless act to get the attention of her outrageous family to get them to open their eyes to the dysfunction that goes on in their home/family/lives... I still don't know which I believe.",

He lives with his common-law wife Beth, and the two of them have four children whom they have raised in a Maori ghetto in Auckland, New Zealand. Alienated from a caste-ridden tribal life, Beth and Jake have little else to fall back on except fly by night jobs and a pack of alcoholic friends. Beth and their children pay the price of living with Jake and Beth's domestic hell in the way of physical and emotional abuse as well as rape. ONCE WERE WARRIORS doesn't exactly proclaim there to be no exit from such a reality, but given everything the protagonists of this film go through, it's remarkable there is even the open-ended resolution that is suggested before the credits roll. The work itself is a densely packed drama with a remarkable cast headed by Rena Owen as Beth Heke and Temuera Morrison (he of later Boba Fett STAR WARS fame)as the ill-matched common-law mates Beth and Jake. Mamaengora Kerr-Bell portrays their sensitive and tragic daughter Gracie with a delicacy that makes the viewer wonder why we've seen so little else of Ms. Kerr-Bell in the 13 years since this film first appeared. ONCE WERE WARRIORS is the urban and shaded reflection of 2002's WHALE RIDER,and as such the former film is a far more graphic and dismal interpretation of the traumas faced by some displaced Maori families in New Zealand. It's not an easy film to watch, but it's careful, ambitious and well deserves all the good things other viewers have been saying about it here.",

Beth Hecke, played by the truly beautiful Rena Owens, is so captivating, that I actually traced her down, wrote to her, and received a delightful reply.

She tried so hard to be normal but was so isolated even in her own family. I felt so sorry for her the entire movie and so badly wanted her to go off somewhere like Boogie so she could have a chance. There was no education or love in her home. Home was the most violent place. She became the mother of the family before the age of 13. Although I didn't buy the actress's age, She had the most hope and potential. Boogie became a mini-Grace. After her *SPOILER* death, her family finally realizes that their situation can't go on. In a way, she sacrificed herself for her family to be able to be a family once again. Beth's arc was huge as well but I'm not sure if I see her as a hero or not. It took her so long and the loss of a child to realize that she needed to abandon Jake for all of the trouble he'd caused. He was responsible for SO much of that family's setbacks. He does truly love Beth but just does not respect her the way she deserves to be treated. I could go on and on, but I have other work to do. This movie was amazing and definitely a must-see!

I'm not saying that I don't believe that there's violence, I mean living in Nottingham in England I've been jumped 3 or 4 times within the last couple of years, I just think without using such cheesy, stereotypical and unrealistically 80's looking characters it would've been a lot easier to watch and the message would've been a lot more potent.

The fact that the husband was both very sweet/loving and horrifically abusive makes the character much more frightening and much more real. Yes other films have managed to show two sides to a person but i can't remember any off hand that go to this extreme. Add to that rape and many not-nice social issues and you have a serious film that deserves its praise IMHO, mainly for taking an important subject and making it into a moving story, that gets it's message across and entertains without (i think) belittlement or too much sentimentality - although this could have been a difficult movie for non-Maoris to follow, the script is written in such a way as to make it accessible to almost anyone. Most of themes really are universal. The film-making hardly gets in the way of telling the story, which is something you only think about afterwards, but very important. If i had to fault the film i would say the characters are a little underdeveloped - it could have done perhaps with being a longer, and the dialogue less general (less abstract, more specific to individuals' situations); but then it might have lost some of its impact.Couple of silly comments risking offence (I *don't* think paedophilia is an amusing topic) but did the rapist remind anyone of Jesus from The Big Lebowski? And (it has to be said sorry) aren't the guys in this film *huge*?8/10 \u0096 recommended, especially for us males (who i notice didn't like this film quite as much).",

            "content": "This was a powerful movie that will make you think and talk about it back to your car. It was very well acted by Temeura Morrison and Rena Owen, both of whom where not well known to me. Not being familiar with the actors prior to this movie made their character (\"Jake the Muss\" and \"Beth Heke\",respectively) even more believable as they explore the issue of domestic violence and loss of identity in the movie. Jake was introduced in the movie as someone who has a lot of love and respect for women, but when alcohol becomes involved, his personality changes from a charmer to a wife beater. As Grace (Jake's daughter) says in the movie, \"people show their true feelings when they are drunk.\" However, Jake is not completely to blame, his wife, Beth, allowed this violence to happen to her. I guess as an audience to this movie, I will never understand why wives stay with their husbands who beat them up. Is it that the good times weigh more that the bad times no matter what is involved in the \"bad times\"? I suppose \"love is blind,\" as they say, and it is this kind of love that is dangerous and gets these women in trouble. Some are realized just in time while, for others, it becomes too late. For Beth, it was a mixture of both. While she realized that Jake was \"still a slave to his fists, his drink, and to himself\", she was able to redeem her identity, leaves Jake, and return to her family, who were once warriors. Unfortunately, it was too late as she was not able to save her daughter, Grace, who hung herself after she had been raped by Uncle Bully, Jake's drinking buddy.Grace had a promising future. She found her identity as she wrote her feelings and stories in her journal. It is too bad that she had to die at a very young age, 13, as she would have embodied a better life and education not only for herself but also for the rest of her family. Her death was a regretful moment for Beth, but also a defining one as she gained her strength for herself and the rest of her children.",

This film just involves you right from the start, and there's no possibility of escaping empathy with the two female characters. Grace's struggle for something better, and her mother's near endless hope and faith in husband Jake are so human that this film stands apart from anything else you'll ever see.",

            "content": "Once Were Warriors is a film that you are instantly compelled to watch, simply because it presents a world that most people are not familiar with.  I'm sure that most Americans and others around the world have heard of the Maori - the native peoples of New Zealand.  But how many can say that they have an idea of what kind of lives these people lead or what the modern day culture looks like.  As far as I know, Lee Tamahori is one of the first directors to show us this culture, which many Americans will instantly compare with south central L.A. gang life and the decay of Native American reservation life.The film's opening scene is very clever.  We are shown a beautiful N.Z. countryside of what most of New Zealand must have looked like before British colonization.  Then the camera pulls back to reveal that it is just a billboard in the middle of the urban insanity that we are all too familiar with - concrete highways.   We are then introduced to an urban ghetto where hip-hop culture looks as though it has latched on to Maori youth and bar brawling and 40 ounzers are all that the rest seem to live for.  Among the latter group is Jake Heke, a macho abusive drunk living with a wife to whom he shows no respect and five kids that he couldn't care less about.There are many qualities to this film. One of which is the costume design which presents a wide variety of hip-hop and biker gang style clothing bringing the grittiness of the social environment to life.Another quality is the undeniably powerful, emotional and inspirational perfomance by Rena Owen as a flawed yet amazingly strong wife and mother.  The scene that I was most compelled by was when Boogie's counseler, who seems to have been whitemanized in his slacks and collared shirt, proves with a Maori spear that he is in fact an honorable warrior.However I would have liked it if the story had drifted off in more directions and made me more familiar with the lesser shown subplots such as Boogie's new-found love of his culture and gang member Nig, whose appealing demeanor is given hardly any attention.  The movie could have been longer to make this possible and it could have scrapped some of the drinking party scenes.Viewers should be warned that there are disturbing scenes of violence against the female characters.  However you should not avoid the film because of this.  In the end, it can be seen as an inspirational story of how inner strength and love can overcome",

            "content": "If you belong to a minority and want to publish your poems, your novel or make your film, your chances are normally better than if you belong to the majority, since a certain yet unspecified kind of preciousness adheres to everything that is scarce. If you had your chance to publish your poems which you possibly could not have published if you had written them, let's say, in English instead of Maori, and if someone criticizes your low level of talent, then you have the chance to accuse your perhaps just critique for the suspect of racism. So, if you belong to any minority, you have too invaluable advantages that no one from a majority has and that make you almost invulnerable.This is the only way I can try to explain to myself why someone whose sanity I would like to presuppose has financed the movie \"Once were warriors\" (1994). According to the company that produced the DVD, the story of the movie goes around a woman who is abused, violated, humiliated and still tries everything in her force to protect her family. When you actually watch the movie, you realize that both the woman and the man are drinkers. She sits already in the early morning at her kitchen table and drinks bottle after bottle of beer. He does exactly the same, only he does it in the local bar. When he comes home drunk, she is also drunk, when he brings money , they sleep with one another, but when he tells her that he earns 13 dollars less the next months, she keeps provoking him until he hits her. Not even than she stops attacking him with the worst possible vocabulary. He does the same, but in all scenes which the movie shows he is defending himself. Since he is the stronger, she always looses. She sits beaten up on the floor and cries: \"Kill me, kill me\". One gets the impression that she enjoys that.Therefore, this is the \"story\": Father drinks, mother drinks, mother provokes father, father beats mother up. That's it. This is repeated around 100 minutes long. The promoting company must have hallucinations when it saw in this movie any social-critical background. At the end of the movie, the mother blames the father because their daughter hung herself up, although we hear that she was raped by another family member. She turns towards him, says the sentence that became the title of this movie and discloses him that she goes \"back to her roots\", i.e. she takes all the children and lets someone else pay for their living, because she does not earn money. \"Once were warriors\" must refer to the New Zealand Wars in the 19th century. However, it is strange that this is brought up in the situation in which the family is, because being a warrior is as untypical for any Polynesian as it can be. Polynesian behavior normally implies going out of the way of any social problem before it even appears. The reason for that may be that the ancestors of the Polynesians, coming to a big part from Europe, by the way, had nobody to fight against when they entered the South Seas Area, so they were not originally warriors. However, the movie has no story, no message, no meaning. It can best shown in which miserable condition today's Maori is, for those who understand the few morsels that they speak. The disaster of the whole film is especially not helped by imposing upon it some weird social ideas at the end.",

            "content": "Once Were Warriors is a gripping film full of emotional ups and downs throughout the film. It shows many viewpoints of how the Maori heritage is upheld after their colonization by the British in the 1800s. From Beth all the way down to Boogie, each person in this family portrays a different piece of Maori culture in their own unique way. Despite their troubled lifestyles Boogie and Nig are able to find ways to keep their culture alive through Spirit Dances (Boogie) or joining a gang that imprints Maori images on their faces and entire bodies. Grace is able to express herself through her storytelling and writing, and it seems that Beth and Jake try to express their cultures through their classes, which seems to bring major clashes and violence between the two throughout this film. Violence seems to play a major role throughout the movie as well, violence that seems to come from a lack of education. This lack of education is not a lack of mathematics or sciences, but a lack of educating ones self to live peacefully with one another in such a hectic household. This can be seen through the brutal abuse that Jake applies to his own spouse, Nig's longing to join a gang that is based on brutality, and Graces outbursts of violence towards her own children. The only person that seems to learn how to cope with such a world is Grace, who writes her thoughts down in her diary. Her way of coping with these situations is destroyed when her own father rips her diary. Through such violence along with a lack of understanding, this leads to Graces suicide; however, through her death comes enlightenment for the family, well everyone except Jake. They learn that violence is not the answer and try to live peacefully as a family without Jake by their side. I can personally say that this film was one of the most amazing films I have seen in a while. Such story telling keeps you in your seat truly making you hope for the best for this family, but knowing the worst will probably happen. A true emotional roller coaster full of joy, aggression, and sadness from beginning to end!!",

Her diary plays a large part in the film, as it is the link to finding out the cause of her suicide.

But this one, was so absorbing and emotionally pure. You could feel the vibes of energy radiating from the performance of each character. It did not have the big budgets of Hollywood trite and possibly that's why it did not have to fulfil any revenue quotas so it was more free to express itself. This is a film which makes other screen violence look trivial. What scares me is that these actors were so realistic in their portrayal that it could've been a home movie. It's scary that people tell me this is the sad state that Maoris who 'Once Were Worriors' have now been reduced to.It's sequel 'What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?' is not as good simply because it didn't have the raw passion this film had. Although nothing 'beautiful' about this film, it is extraordinarily powerful.(by the way, the reconmendation for Thelma and Louise [if you like this movie then we suggest] is not exactly correct in my opinions anyway.

It is a story about the loss of a cultures identity and their life of disadvantages. The story revolved around a Maori family, and there hard ships living in a poverty stricken Maori enclave in Aukland, New Zealand. They were a people descending from the great Maoris tribe, but had forgotten that. They are a community that is extremely intertwined and face many social and economic hardships. The lack of education seems to be a large factor to the problem , if not the the problem itself. Beth is a mother to many children (most notable: Boogie, Nig, and Grace,) and the wife of Jake \"The Muss.\" She is trapped in a world of violence, abuse ,and alcohol. She is a strong willed Maori woman that pays for her opinions with beatings from Jake, both verbally and physically. The women in this film are set out to be nothing more than the object of a mans affection and the source for a hot meal. The ironic thing is,that the women see nothing wrong with that, with the exception of Grace. Grace reads and writes and dreams of a better life away from Aukland. The men in this film are always drinking and violent. Jake is a man who is trapped in his own self loathing. It drives him crazy and makes him angry and violent. But, sometimes it's possible to have mixed feeling about his actions,it makes you wonder what his real reasons are for doing what he does. Nig and Boogie, are Jake's and Beth's oldest sons. They both are rebellious and struggle to find there way. They never seemed to get the attention from Jake that they needed, so they sought it elsewhere. They have to part ways in order to find and make there own journey's to find their true and own identities. they do this by going and looking back at their heritage and embracing the past. All the characters personalities are completely different, but yet it brings them all together. This was a film about exploring yourself, conquering social norms and injustices, and trying to find your own truth in order to be at peace with your life.

The opening shot showed what people think of New Zealand, then pans out to the real world with characters filling that gritty universe that had a bit of a \"Do the Right Thing\" feel to it- constant, turbulent social interaction on the brink of a massive chain reaction which does end up resulting.Some of the acting was a bit off, for instance the eldest daughter and the father's reaction when he finds out what actually happened to her at the end (the guy who caused the whole thing should've been brutally murdered). Then some actors could have been fleshed out a LOT more, such as the two eldest brothers in the family- one a sissy that learns how to fight with a stick and another one that joins a gang. Though they did learn how to stand up for themselves and act like men, big brother still felt like a promising Mad Max scoundrel. As for little brother, he still ends up as an inferiority complex wired boyscout that can swing a stick around, so much potential wasted.But other than that, I absolutely loved this film. It was visually appealing, the plot was painful (in a good way, masochism?) to experience and certainly thrilling. The simple fact that it could have been even more than it was? Not a bad thing- it only shows that the conceptual seed of the screenplay was one that would be sure to later grow into a grand old oak tree instead of at most a small bush.",

Rena Owen as his beyond brave wife Beth, also demands much praise for her performance (haven't seen her in much since the little known sequel, and yes I could bring up a number of points about both ethnicity and gender.). Like all the great films 'Once Were Warriors' confronts a truth of matters that so often are so often hidden away and treated as social taboo's.

It is the scene in which Boogie was performing the Haka right after he got off the phone with his mother. He did so as a means to take out all his frustrations; to find a way to deal with the pain he was feeling. Like all the characters in the movie, who have their own way of redirecting their frustrations, Boogie redirects his in a more constructive manner. The Haka dance in the movie is symbolic for one's search for their identity. Boogie inevitably gets in touch with his roots and later, stating to his brother, that he wears his tattoos on the inside. This shows that Boogie is proud of who he is and of where he came from.Not only does this movie focus on the search for oneself, but it also focuses on several aspects of racism and ethnocentricity. Many cultures have subcultures that are belittled by their own people. Although they may be from the same country, they are degraded and treated poorly. This movie touches on several points that many people can relate to. I would recommend watching this to learn a few things about the Maori culture and to gain a little knowledge on how other cultures are treated outside your own.",

The film gives a great account of domestic violence; we get to experience how volatile stability in a family is, and how quick things can turn for the worst.Rena Owen is brilliant and gives an Oscar-worthy performance. She really digs deep and serves as the heart of the film. The emotional roller-coaster the viewer experiences is through her brilliant acting. I think Hollywood should have tapped more into her talent. Temuera Morrison is also brilliant, and the scene in the end with Uncle Bully was gut-wrenching.Overall; great acting, fine directing, simple story and a decent depiction of Maori culture. \"Once Were Warriors\" is highly recommended.",

Although there were some scenes that were very hard to watch and made me sometimes think again about how it was filmed...nonetheless it was amazing.The broad thrust to an international audience is the link between domestic violence and lower socio-economic classes but the original intention of Alan Duff was to describe the disconnection and \"lost path\" of Maori from their traditional tribal roots. Maori did not treat their families in this manner in history, but their alienation from tribal life and living in modern society has brought changes that can be extremely difficult to cope with. Many people will look at it without understanding Maori whakapapa (genealogy and tribal links) and whanau (family) and say 'that kind of life was long in the past and they should be able to cope' but the reality is vastly different. Really the movie is about the detrimental affects alienation from ones culture and turangawaewae (standing place, or birth place) can have. You might pick up on this when Beth and the kids are overlooking her Marae and Beth is talking about the way things used to be.What did you, the IMDb community think?",

            "content": "One thing that struck me while watching this film is that there are several strong similarities between \"Once Were Warriors\" and Tennessee Williams/Elia Kazan's \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" It almost seems like Once Were Warriors is a modern, Maori update of \"Streetcar\". Both films deal with similar events and characters, but emphasize their themes differently. Both films deal with contrast between modern life and an idealized, noble past. In \"Warriors\", there are several references to traditional Maori society, which has been superseded by Western Colonialism. In \"Streetcar\", we have references to the family plantation, which has been lost to creditors. The Maori traditions are represented as proud heritage that should be emulated, versus the plantation, which symbolizes a decadent past that cannot be retrieved.When we are introduced to Jake the Muss, he is trying to charm his family by bringing them seafood. This is similar to the scene in \"Streetcar\" where Stanley comes home with a wrapped package for Stella. She asks what it is and Stanley replies \"meat!\" Both Stanley and Jake are big, dumb, prone to violence, but somehow manage to be charming at the same time. We see both characters express disdain for a more intellectual relative, and continually bring home drunken parties, which annoy their wives and family. The biggest difference involves the rape of a fragile, intellectual character: Blanche/Grace. Stanley rapes Blanche, his sister-in-law while Stella is at the hospital giving birth to their child. Jake, on the other hand, is never shown as being unfaithful to Beth, although there is a similar rape carried out by one of his friends, whom Jake has brought into the house. Beth is similar to Stella in that both characters decided to leave their traditional home and ended up in a bad neighborhood, married to a charming, vulgar, alpha-male. It should be noted that Beth is a lot tougher and more strong-willed than Stella, although both characters take a lot of abuse throughout the films, but end up standing up for themselves in the end and leaving their abusive husbands in the films. This is not what happens in the original play. In the play, the ending is bleak as Stella stays with Stanley, but in the film, she leaves with her child and vows never to go back. This relatively up-beat ending carries over to \"Once Were Warriors\", where Beth leaves Jake in the parking lot of the pub as he wails for her (Quoting the iconic high-angle shot of Brando screaming \"Stella\" from the courtyard). For me, this ending seemed a bit too neat in Beth's sudden rejection of Jake and their lifestyle and the dialogue here felt too on-the-nose. I find the doomed ending of the play more poignant and, unfortunately, more realistic. Still it is a powerful, well-made film, with a great soundtrack. If you enjoyed \"Once Were Warriors\", be sure to watch the classic film and read the original play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" to see other ways this type of subject matter was handled.",

The characters who seemed to be the good guys in the beginning ended up not being who they appeared to be. And they way the character's developed was totally genius! I do not think anyone would have guessed how it all turned out.Through my course of life, I've met a few women from Australia and New Zealand. The one thing they all admired about American men is the way we treat our women. I never quite understood what they meant until I saw this movie. NOT saying or implying that ALL men from Australia and New Zealand treated their women this way, but I can see through how different American women are in comparison how this movie would be true.Sadly enough to say, this type of behavior happens here in our own backyard. And what's even more sad is how people turns the other way while this continue. But, as in everything in life with how are actions are, the children suffer the ultimate sacrifice!

The mother is a great role for this movie, she is very caring but somewhat of a pushover. The family isn't functional together, its more of the children taking care of themselves and the parents providing a house and food, that is all. Gracie seems to be the most caring of the children, her two brothers are not very helpful and have come to realize they really only care about themselves and their lives.

            "content": "\"Once Were Warriors\" is an emotionally packed film that follows a Maori family that is struggling to stay together due to domestic violence, sexual assault, and alcoholism. This movie is as real as it gets and truly depicts the aftermath of colonization on the native people years after. From Jake's trouble with alcoholism and abusiveness due to his family being from a long line of slaves to Beth's unwillingness to return home because she was ousted due to her marriage with Jake, everyone is in some sort of bind that is essentially killing them. Even the children aren't saved from the horrors of this mess and all are effected in some way. However with that being said in my eyes two characters managed to make it through this hell but in ways that one wouldn't necessarily be considered conventional. For example the eldest of the brothers, Nig, joined a street gang but in doing so he managed to live past the abusiveness that his father had displayed and made a secondary family that although is usually seen in a negative connotation in most cases. This is sort of a rare example of how a gang or \"second family\" can be beneficial. The other character that made it out was the younger brother of Nig, Boogie who early in the movie was caught by police stripping a car of its interior that eventually sent him away to juvenile hall where he later learned to vent his anger through The Haka, a traditional Maori War Dance, rather than through his fists. Unfortunately though not all characters were as lucky as these two and sadly one had to perish in an emotionally heartbreaking manner. Grace, the daughter of Jake and Beth had committed suicide after being raped by her fathers friend Bully but with Graces death came a new age for the family. Beth had decided enough was enough with Jake and decided to move on without him because he wasn't a suitable father and she gave Grace a \"queens\" burial at her family grave site.

I was spellbound from the very first frame to the last. The plot is compelling, yet down-to-earth. Every acting performance is flawless, even the children weren't, well, all that bad, for kids(and they weren't used so much that you really noticed). The dialog, apart from one or two instances of lines that no one says outside of a movie, is perfect and natural. All of the characters are credible, psychologically accurate and have genuine personality. Not one of them is one-note, neither good nor bad. This delves into some of the culture of the Maori, and it is handled remarkably well. I don't think I heard a single snicker from the 20+ people in the room. Heck, personally, I wouldn't have minded if there had been more still. This has marvelous editing and cinematography, they really capture the environment. The pace is spot-on, I wasn't bored for a second.

            "content": "\"Once Were Warriors\" is an allegedly \"great\" film about a Maori(sp?) family facing many troubles. Jake, the husband, is an alcoholic, who turns to abuse when \"under the influence.\" Beth, the wife, is...the victim, both of Jake's rage and of her the misgivings relating to her children. Beth's eldest son, for example, is so jilted and misguided he ends up in a rehabilitation center and her oldest daughter has the burden of caring for all of her siblings(there are a couple of extremely pointless younger children)and....\n*spoilers*(the daughter)eventually kills herself. It's not a happy story, but it's not one of those films that especially *wowed* me with its sadness and poignancy. I found Beth to be a little TOO passive, and--on occasion--utterly grating. Her treatment of the husband(who started out mildly interesting, and became boorishly stupid in the end) was ridiculous and I would imagine that abused women would find it unsatisfying. The entire reason I had to watch this movie(it was an assignment in my victimology class) was to write about how it applied to domestic violence. As a \"DV\" film, though, it just did not work, particularly the end, when Beth \"stands up\" to Jake. I can't imagine many women suffering from domestic violence would find that inspiring.Thus, what I ended up writing, more or less, was that people should study this film in relation to alcoholism instead. When the husband was not drinking(as far as I remember) he was no prince, but I recall the family getting along a lot better. Instead of the family helping Jake DEAL with this problem, they casually turn their backs on him in the end. An alcoholic watching this film could certainly see the effects of alcohol on families, but the lousy ending of this film provides them with no help or support. What does this all mean...that as a movie attempting to tackle issues(whether they be flat-out or subtle)\"Once Were Warriors\" does not make the grade.\"OWW\" also fails to make the grade with its subplot involving the Maori culture. The film ATTEMPTS to tie the culture to the rest of the story is that Beth is a Maori, while Jake is...not. I don't recall this being mentioned more than scarcely at first, but then these references  start creeping up, like Beth and Jake's extremely irritating son joining what appeared to be some Maori gang and getting a lot of tattoos(it would have been nice if they'd explained those further), and Beth seeming to turn more to her culture as the film progresses. I think this is supposed to be inspiring, especially the ending, when she calls Jake a \"peasant\" (or something) and says that he'll never be anything more, while she is \"the superior\" race. She...doesn't condemn what Jake has done to her or the family or even confront it(not that I recall, anyway), she states she's better than Jake because she's a Maori and he's not... Right, Beth, make the Maori's look like elitist snobs. Great.I'm sure the Maori's are a nice and honorable tribe. I can recognize that this film was probably TRYING to show that Maori's have an honor that helps them rise above even the most dire situations. I just did think that the film did even a sub-par job of showing this. In honesty, the Maori-influenced scenes--overall--were so utterly distracting that I had to wonder if they--and that plot angle--were only included at all because some Maori group had helped provide the funding, or something. I know that's a little bit mean, but I honestly would have felt the same way if it had been any other religion or race. It was just not needed for the movie.All in all, when it came to being a film on domestic violence, alcoholism, and the Maori culture, I felt \"Once Were Warriors\"----- failed on all counts.",

            "content": "\"Once Were Warriors\", a modern story of a Maori family living in Auckland, New Zealand shows the unfortunate psychological effects and consequences that can befall people when they have been colonized by a foreign power and long been removed from their native cultural heritage and customs. This is exemplified mostly in the characters of the father Jake Heke and his two delinquent sons Nig and Mark \u2013 a.k.a. \"Boogie\". This film shows very clearly how a life of confusion, alcohol abuse, and utter violence can result when people either never were in touch with their cultural heritage or just do not show much interest or respect for their cultural past to do so. An interesting point in the film is when Jake Heke does not even want his daughter to be buried traditionally among her ancestors. \"Once Were Warriors\" is a classic example of how cultural alienation can cause some people to be at odds with themselves and not know who they are inside. This film shows not only how people suffering from cultural alienation causes them to be disconnected from their roots \u2013 but how when people are disconnected from their roots they also become disconnected from themselves.",

And yet, it was an uplifting movie that fills the viewer with hope, almost like a cleansing process.The story revolves around Beth and Jake, a couple with several children who are living in what many would consider to be poverty. They have a small house in a run down neighborhood. Jake spends most of his time at the same bar with the same friends. Beth struggles to manages her family, which includes several troubled teens.One son has already left home, it seems, and has joined a gang. One son is being sent away to a facility for delinquent youth. The teen daughter Grace looks to be trying hard to help her mother take care of her younger siblings, but is pushed to the edge by the actions of her father and her mother's willingness to put up with it.When tragedy strikes, Beth looks to her heritage for healing. The scenes where the native rituals were performed were among the most powerful for me. The people showed such strength and intensity, full of spiritual reserve.Although I highly recommend the sequel, I think the open-ended climax will feel like real ending for most viewers. Very powerful, and deserving of a wider audience.",

It allows all the \"Jake the Musses\" out there to look at themselves through Temuera Morrison's portrayal of this character and to ask themselves; \"am I really this bad?, I know I can loose my temper now and then but surely I'm not like this monster..or am I?\" For me this movie was a story that needed to be told, so our people could see ourselves in this horrible way so that we may understand the affect our behaviour has on one another.Don't get me wrong I don't like this film because of its dark nature and violence, but I rate it so high because the good quality acting and directing have portrayed so many undeniable truths so accurately.",

            "content": "This film has obviously provoked a wide range of emotions and differing reactions from the posters. I feel compelled to respond to the numerous erroneous and quite frankly ignorant comments posted by many people, the majority of whom I suspect have no or very little background knowledge to the film's subject matter.Contrary to what many people state, the film is not primarily concerned with domestic violence, nor alcoholism, nor family dysfunction, rather the marginalization of a race within their own country. Having studied this film and its background in depth, I feel that I need to correct the false statements about the Maori race and New Zealand social conditions general.Firstly, the film does present an undeniably real situation, that of the self-perpetuating and unbreakable cycle in which low socio-economic families must live. Following mass urbanization after WWII, Maori people underwent massive changes within their own country, moving into urban centers where the living and social conditions were primarily defined by for the most part European New Zealanders. This combination of under-unemployment, lack of education, inability to adapt to a lack of traditional family support (the substitution of the gang), poverty and alcohol abuse was responsible for the creation of the events seen in this film.This film however is not representative of all Maori people within New Zealand, the majority of whom are people who are very proud of their heritage and culture. In fact, within the past 30 years, there has been a renaissance of interest in Maori culture, particularly amongst teenagers such as those seen in this film. As such, the numerous comments passed to this effect need to be corrected.Furthermore, comments by several users that the over-riding and so-called clich\u00e9d presence of Maori culture was simply due to the fact that this film was supposedly funded by a Maori organization are entirely false. Upon its time of release, this film was the source of much controversy within New Zealand and with Maori groups, who objected to the airing of so-called dirty laundry in such an unsubtle manner.This film does present events which can be traumatic to viewers, but what it also does is present audiences with a highly accurate portrayal of the stark reality for many families in New Zealand.Thus, if users are unaware of the ideological background of this or any other film of a similar emotional and cultural magnitude, I would advise that they re-consider their overtly false and wholly ill-informed comments prior to posting them.",

A film draws from life with the purpose of telling a story which leaves you more than just entertained. That is the job of the movie. A documentary leaves you informed.Of course these boundaries are always crossed as is the case in OWW. While much of the violence is real, it's widespread nature and frequency is exaggerated.For example, only Heke's family has any problems. No other Maori have any troubles. But this is a tool which allows the director to bring into sharp focus the horrid situation of this particular family, i.e. there are no other distractions.====================================================I read Paid's comment and want to repeat it here for obvious reasons - it is so moving. I want to tell you Paid, that after seeing OWW I didn't think I knew the Maori, nor that many of them are like \"Jake Heke,\" but instead saw the once great tribe now learning new ways, while holding on to their beloved traditions. I respect them and am glad to have seen the movie for that.From Paid:i would be happier if the emphasis on the \"Maori\" aspect of the movie wasn't so prevalent. as posted here... this could be anywhere, anyone, anytime... please don't think you know Maori issues because you have see a movie about a small minority... we fight a battle of racism, stereotype and discrimination every day... and when maori life is highlighted like this in media or a brown face does something wrong on the news we lose a small amount of ground in that fight.this is a people problem... not a maori people problem maybe we Once Were Warriors... but we are still proud, beautiful and full of mana... actually, i'm still a warrior, the battle has changed.i think of that night at the movies and am glad i never see those people... the discussing they had on way home still amazes me... \" i know a maori, and it's just like that... he comes to school bleeding all the time and he never has any lunch\"no... you don't know a Maori... and he's sitting right next to you. ====================================================Incredibly well said Paid.Now to the movie:Innocence and grace are killed. Tradition is dead. The hearts of the Maori are bleeding. Their ancient culture is nearly erased but thanks to a Maori who found his path in this technological (modern) age, he is able to help the Maori youth, and people, find their way in a modern world.The sole source of all the violence is one man: Jake Heke, played brilliantly by Temuera Morrison. You not only see he is the biggest dog in the \"junkyard,\" but you feel his rage - perhaps even to the point of scaring the other actors near him during shooting(?)Three factions appear in the movie - the gang, the urban Maori, and the social worker trying to rescue the Maori's future by teaching the young boys about their great and courageous past. (This is mad loud and clear by Paid's wonderful comment, the end of which I included above.)Watching most of the film is like receiving one of Jake's beatings - and it won't let you go. However, towards the end there is a positive upswing. This leads you to think that there is hope for the Maori after all. Although the scene was too pretentious (Mom gives an \"aria\" which states the whole thrust of the movie like being hit in the face with a maceral) it isn't too long to ruin the whole movie. However the point is still well made and the hope is well set in your heart.The hope is also implied by the trend in male behavior. All the violent men were old - all the boys were non-violent. They had no rage in them - as personified by the lead character, Jake Heke.This points to the change that is going on among this great tribe of people. They are learning new ways in a strange world (modern technology is not a culture - it seems that technology can only thrive if culture is absent).Heke's wife tries to bring some semblance of normalcy to the erratic background the father provides by his drunken rage. It is impossible, and the only solution is made clear by the social worker and Beth, Jake's wife at the near end of the film \"...we once were warriors.\"As Paid said, this is a film about people - perhaps about all the conquered tribal peoples of the world... yes, indeed, - and so it will stand the test of time and become a true classic forever.Zafoid",

Unfortunately, the story leaves much to be desired because it's not nothing out of the ordinary. To a T the plot consists of a Maori family struggling with an abusive father and local social alienation. Despite oodles of tragedies the movie shifts to predictability when the mother meets a new man and begins to distance herself from her husband; this shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel and you eventually know what will happen on the end. I was reminded of this film when watching \"Affliction\" (1997) which was also a family drama about domestic abuse (and also well acted). but \"Affliction\" took an approach with the bleak story by an anti-climatic ending. Nonconclusive endings are generally good for topics of this nature because it makes you look back at the movie, making it unforgettable. If you must see this, you will undoubtedly agree that the cast of characters were first rate, but (as long as you don't mind an unremarkable story) it will work on that level only.",

This story really gets into lives of a Maori family struggling in a non-Maori world where the mainstream society couldn't give two hoots about Maori life or history. In this story, the father is so brainwashed into thinking that his Maori background is evil and bad while the rest of the family has no qualms with their heritage. This a very sad story because the father's drinking makes life worse for the rest of his family and only adds fuel to the fire of self-hate. It was only after the daughter died when he realized that family is important, not because of their Maori heritage. But because the man's family is the only important thing he had.Furthermore, the man discovered that his family came from a long line of \"slaves\". This angered him even more because the very thought of not coming from a more elite background like he would have hoped belittled him and only made him hate his own Maori heritage even more. Towards the end, Beth mentions to her husband that the Maori are proud of their heritage by saying that they come from a long line of warriors with a lot of spirit. Jake scoffed back at her by saying that he hated the Maoris due to them \"always living in the past\" and that their warrior spirit can go stick it. \"Forget about this warrior garbage\", he tells his wife. As a result from these large differences of character and personality along with the stress from their daughter's suicide, the couple decide to split up. This is really good film although a sad one as well. The daughter's suicide was extremely sad that saw the beginning of the end of the family. But I am very surprised that this one never received any Academy Awards for best film because this certainly deserves them. Anyway, \"Once Were Warriors\" earns an 8 out of 10 in my books.",

The family is being brutalized by their father/husband who goes on an alcohol rampage on a regular basis. We see the fear in the children's faces, we watch their mother get beaten up and sense how she in process looses her self-esteem. The father treats the whole of his family in a degrading fashion and in this sense the movie doesn't divide the guilt; the father is the one solely to blame for everything that brings the family down. Of course this occurs in real life and is quite believable but we would have been move challenged if the cause of there problems in some sense was divided between the two (and by this I am not suggesting that Domestic violence is in any case anybody else's fault but the one who swings his fist).There is a great deal of realism in the movie but there is also a development in the characters that is quite positive; I think it is a wise choice to add some optimism and show a possible way out of the misery or else the story wouldn't be endurable to watch. I also think that this movie is a perfect example of a low budget production that gets the job done in a very persuasive way and that this could/should challenge other potential movie-makers to follow the example; You don't need big cash if you have the story and talent!Highly recommend this movie...

If the idea of the director was to depict how low human behavior is when they are faced with poverty and their culture is stolen then I think that the numerous times that we were forced to watch the husband beat his wife violently was enough to prove a point. So yes, I was actually furious that I had to watch such vulgar display of senseless violence and sexual abuse with no proper story line or purpose.I was left with a huge sense of emptiness and hatred for the people that continuously try to sell violence as entertainment. That's the sole achievement of movies like this, to generate hate against each other and that is very sad.....",

From beginning to end it inspired so many different emotions, from laughter, to sorrow, to anger and indignation. Each member of the Heke family had their own personal demons to deal with, and they all dealt in the only ways they knew how: Jake, through alcohol, Nig, with the street gang, Boogie, through crime, and Beth, going back to her roots. This movie is a perfect example that if all else fails go back to the beginning. I applaud the actors for the fierce passion that they all displayed in making this movie. It is one that touched me deeply and will stay with me for some time to come. It is unfortunate that OWW never made it to the States. I feel very fortunate that i got a chance to see it.",

It is ten times more powerful and dramatic than Boys Don't Cry, which was also good, but not nearly as brilliant as this one. Once Were Warriors is a movie with a clear vision that knows exactly what it is doing. There is nicely choreographed violence and drama that plays out real well. Plus the lighting and cinematography were brilliant, but all that means nothing if the movie is unfocused. This one is not. It's made by people who know what they're doing. Who say, \"okay, so people aren't going to recognize this if it's dull at all, so we got to make it exciting, but at the same time not lose focus of the story.\" And they do it, which is an amazing accomplishment. I especially liked how orange filters that tend to be seen in all Michael Bay action movies were used here to raise the level of dramatic intensity. I am so glad I saw this movie because it is the kind of thing that I could have easily gone my whole life without seeing just because I never heard of it. That would have been a dam shame. Movies like this really should be recognized and make me embarressed to be a filmaker when I see that they are not.",

That experience has since instilled a strong sense of compassion and patience in me despite the most degrading treatment shown to me at the hands of those I've attempted to help, but if it has taught me anything in my quest as a writer, it is that you must never judge the characters you encounter or create if you want to do justice to them or make them whole, and that is exactly how I feel about the characters portrayed in Lee Tamahori's Once Were Warriors. Despite the intense violence this film depicts I all at once connected to its story and characters as if they were extensions of my own self. Tamahori presents an emotional epic that is brutal yet honest and spares us from unnecessary romantics.Through the magnificent performances of its epic cast not only does it illustrate the complexities of passion and love, but also of forgiveness and redemption for oneself and others through utter and complete humanity and three dimensional characters. Jake Heke is all at once the violent antagonist as he is the misguided child who desperately searches for love and affection the only way he knows how, through violence and the gang ethic he has instilled in him. If you know what it's like to really be alone and to grasp at straws in a vain effort to protect yourself from it you won't hate him despite the most deplorable actions he undertakes. This film carries a strong and powerful message about inner strength, the power of heritage and history, and its capacity to mold human ambition and character through acceptance and admiration versus shame and suffering.",

That is either true or I'm just imagining it and my memory of older events is flawed.Anyway this movie stands out as something special and it's a shame its sequel didn't quite live up to it.

            "content": "1994 was a great year for Kiwi cinema. Two masterpieces were released that year, Peter Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures\" and Lee Tamahori's \"Once Were Warriors\". The latter film deals with issues we are still grappling with today: alcoholism/substance abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse, rape of a child, poverty, and the deleterious effects of colonialism. While many movies are referred to as \"powerful\" and \"raw\", \"Once Were Warriors\" is one of the few that truly lives up to those labels. Its gut-wrenching story unfolds with an operatic intensity, juxtaposing scenes of mirth against scenes of incredible violence. Unless you're a sociopath, you will be horrified by the abuse. In one scene, however, the father unleashes a torrent of extreme brutality that leaves the viewer cheering him on, in effect, making one complicit with the violence. The characters are drawn with genuine complexity, and the acting of the leads is jaw-dropping. \"Once Were Warriors\" is, undeniably, a very bleak film, but it also offers a vision of strength and hope. I guarantee, this is a film you will never forget.",

It's horrifically violent, and I definitely would not recommend it for a first date.Despair, cultural displacement, domestic violence and alcoholism are its darker themes, but the triumph of human dignity is its redemption. An earlier reviewer said the storyline was \"unstimulating\" - I could not disagree more. At least all reviewers agree that the acting is stunning.For Information's Sake: The film is set in NEW ZEALAND, not Australia - I'm amazed at how many previous reviewers seem to think they are the same place. None of the reviewers seemed to notice the theme of cultural displacement, which applies to not only the Maoris of New Zealand, but the Aborigines of Australia, the Native Americans of the USA or the Inuits of Canada/Alaska (to name, sadly, but a few...)An absolute 10/10.

Beth, his wife who gave up her royal heritage for the love of Jake, now live an unpredictable life not knowing the moment to moment temper of her husband shifting between loving, caring and violent drunkard, who nevertheless think he is in control of the situation though his only way of communicating really is with his fists. They have children, the sons representing a split in choice of life when one of them find the faith and trust he needs in the study of the original Maori culture, the other falling deeper and deeper into the brutal trust of a street gang, both in the consequence of lacking a guiding father figure. The eldest daughter, literate and silent, a loner with few to talk to, is the one taking care of the family, keeping it together in its permanent state of desperation, love, hurt, drinking and violence until...Yes, this movie hurts to watch. Sometimes it is too close to reality and no matter what happens you always feel for the persons involved. Jake has pride but lives a life far from what he would want it to be when alcohol takes over. Beth is constantly aware of what she gave up and why, but her love for Jake is deeper than the cuts and bruises. Everything taking place in a society where the pride of the warrior has faded in the stained wallpapers and unemployment of the suburb, and the hope for something better to be is the only thing left to struggle for. They all try to find ways of living their lives, and one must feel compassion with that, even though it hurts.I sincerely recommend this movie for everyone to see, but be aware of some very disturbing scenes.",

The turmoil surrounding the Author Alan Duff, his depiction of Urban Maori and who did or did not pen the screen play is in it's self the stuff of films. The off screen activities of Rena Owen made her portrayal seem more reality than acting.  Within all this is rising star Temuera Morrison  and cousin to world famous singer Howard Morrison trying to make his breakout film.You do not need to be Maori to understand this depiction of violence and poverty.  This is a story of many men and women in violent Marriages, raising children in the filth of decaying urban sprawl.  Alan Duff's tale of family tragedy is set in urbanized  South Auckland  where Beth (Rena Owen) and Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison - Island or Dr Moreau, Speed II, Barbwire) live in a small house with four their five children. A domino effect of violence and tragedy begin when Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) has been arrested, and when neither of his parents appear at his court hearing, he is sentenced to enter \"Maori Centered\" social welfare custody. Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell) a child struggling to find her womanhood often carries the burden of her family's struggle, punishment for her intelligence and gentle spirit.  The Heke parents violence flows readily and continues to drag their children into a hopeless abyss.I watched \"Once Were Warrior\" when I moved back to the states... the Powerful scenes and characters did not loose any of their edge with the passing of time.

            "content": "What starts off as an upbeat exploration of one Maori family's life in the slums of New Zealand quickly becomes a dark, cautionary, tale of the dangers of ignorance in any society. Tamahori shows his true mastery of the cinematic language in this film; it's almost hard to believe that the man that directed \"Once Were Warriors\" is the same man who later on directed \"Die Another Day,\" and \"XXX: The State of the Union.\" Though gratuitous violence may abound in his other films, nothing about any of the violent scenes in this film can be called superfluous. Though the beginning of the film seems bright, as the audience is further exposed to the life of the Heke family, a sense of hopelessness abounds. The overarching theme in this film is sacrifice and self-restraint. Both parents of the Heke family, Jake and Beth, are unwilling to sacrifice their own personal interests for the sake of the future generation, their children. Beth refuses to restrain her husband from holding a party the night before their son's trial, and even goes so far as joining the party. Beth also refuses to restrain herself from giving into her \"love\" for her husband, and consistently chooses to trap herself and her children in a dangerous household instead of choosing the more logical choice of leaving for better opportunities. Jake's lack of sacrifice is more physical than Beth's, as he is unable to restrain himself from acting violently when he is angry, and also refuses to treat the role of fatherhood with the same sense of responsibility that is common to most cultures. Instead of immediately looking for work and a way to pay for the possibility of a better life for his family, Jake decides to take advantage of New Zealand's generous welfare system. Jake is unable to sacrifice his carefree life to provide for the future of his family, and he is unable to sacrifice the alcohol that keeps him tied to the bar instead of his family. The lack of education in the slums is perhaps the most startling matter, as education seems to be the only plausible solution to the ills of the Maori slums. The Hekes' oldest daughter, Grace, is the only character that presents a glimmer of hope for the future, due to the fact that she is literate and interested in pursuing further education and art, beyond the borders of the slums. Of course, the only way for the rest of the Heke family to understand that they should poisonous atmosphere of the slums is for one of the family members to sacrifice their own interests to allow others to pursue a better future. Instead of parental sacrifice however, Grace's suicide after she is raped by her father's close friend, provides the catalyst for change. \"Once Were Warriors\" serves as an educational catalyst as well, promoting awareness of the harsh realities of a world without education, self-sacrifice, or restraint. Without the capability of pushing one own's immediate desires aside, the foundation for a better future can never be created. The way that Tamahori plays with the audience's expectations and his in-your-face directorial style, matched with an incredibly enticing storyline is what makes this film great. The film's message is both specific to one area of the world, and universal in its scope. I can honestly say that this film is now one of my favorite movies, though it is not for the faint of heart, or those that choose to believe that ignorance is bliss. If anything, this film demonstrates how important knowledge is in the path to end human suffering, and that ignorance of the immediate and long term effects of one's own actions can only lead to pain.",

Yes, we can dream with a man that has knives for fingers a la Freddy Krueger, or we can also be scared of going inside the woods because maybe there's a Blair Witch Project around or a Jason Vorhees just behind our backs that will kill us with a machete, but what it's really scary is when you live a horror story inside your own house with the ones you care about and you're afraid of your own uncle for example.\"The boogeyman is real and you found it\" is a quote from House of a 1000 Corpses, but it completely translates into this shocking piece of cinema.Once were Warriors is the story of Beth, a woman who is married with a guy that drinks a lot, and happens to be possessive and abusive, that's why I only drink on special occasions. The awful part is THIS is a real horror story that many women live on a daily basis.The movie has scenes of extreme violence and the acting of Rena Owen, who plays Beth, is great, thanks to a screenplay penned by a woman which has a result a multi-layered character. On the other hand, although I hated the character of the abusive husband, played by Cliff Curtis, sometimes it felt a little bit overacted, but that's just me. Beth Reminded me of Sarah Connor at times and the scenes inside the bar sometimes made me think about The Terminator and the famous scene where the T-800 is looking for Sarah.I wish this movie was in 3D because I wanted to strangle the husband every time he was on screen, I mean it, he's one of those bad guys you just want to see burned and tortured at the end of the flick, but i wont spoil nothing to you because IMDb can burn me and that would be a shame.The directing is great and the way they present the characters in the first five minutes of the film makes me wonder if Quentin Tarantino is a fan of this film, because 10 years later Kill Bill used similar techniques on this particular element.In a nutshell this is a real horror movie, a great date flick (your girl will squeeze you to death) and one of those movies that really helps to create a moral conscience towards the evil that surrounds us in the real world and the nightmare lots of families live inside their own houses.This one will haunt you after you watch it!",

I got it on video and remember re-watching it a number of times and still being struck by the power of the story and performances.However, I've just watched it for the first time in over 10 years on DVD and have to say that it doesn't seem quite as strong a film as I used to imagine. My old impression was that it avoided the clich\u00e9s of the weaker 'ghetto' movies: particularly, those pieces of dialogue that are so clumsily shoehorned in to emphasise the social point being made, they make you wince. Maybe it's unfair to suggest this film can be rather glib or clich\u00e9d at times but there are some awkward moments, largely due to wooden acting from the young actors playing Grace and Boogie. I thought that Kerr-Bell was great when I first saw it but I wasn't quite so impressed this last time.It is a gripping and harrowing drama, though, and the leads are fantastic. Morrison's part could have been an exercise in scenery-chewing if not handled right, but it's a very assured performance and he brings such conviction to the role that his character is truly believable. Frightening but compelling, Jake is a horrendous, damaged and utterly selfish person but you feel his charisma and he can turn on the charm when he wants to. Owen's Beth starts the film displaying a weary playfulness as she tries to stay strong for her children while her disgust with Jake's selfish and violent behaviour is reaching the limits of tolerance. When it all spirals out of control, Owen brings a strength and dignity to the role that make Beth such a memorable heroine. Cliff Curtis as slimy Uncle Bully is pretty good, too.",

THe acting is wonderful, these actors should be given many more opportunities in other movies but probably will not. Female viewers may not like it when Jake punches his wife, but as the other reviewer said the total message is positive and upbeat. The inside look at Maori culture, and problems, is eye opening and valuable too. Good sound track. Incredibly, you can listen to an alternate soundtrack with Maori language used - this certainly must be a unique chance for American viewers. JR Miller",

We see five separate characters find their identity and how they deal with representing themselves as a Maori people. This film tells the viewer that a culture must come together to find themselves. Each individual fails in their attempt to find who they are but when they come together everything becomes more simple. This is truly attested when Grace dies, the whole family seems to come together. Keeping you're heritage is also an important value in this film and we see that with Boogey. In the end of this film I myself was jealous of the fact that these people have such a strong identity. They have very close ties to their heritage and you just want to slap some of them for not being more intact with it. There culture is very distinct and is very strong to last through all they have been through. This film was a great depiction of a beautiful culture and how it can either be accepted or tossed aside.",

Lee Tamahori did a great job directing this film it is truly amazing and very sad. Just the first scene caught my eyes. It starts with the camera on a billboard with beautiful mountains and luscious lands and the words \"tourist attraction\" then it drifts down to a ghettoish area with dirty streets and graffiti. The land that once was great; the Mauri land was colonized. The Heke family is really messed up. The absence of a true father and mother figure and the lack of love really affect each of their children emotionally and physically. There were many ways of embracing a new colonized land that has deprived your spirit such as through gangs, personal morals, abuse, and alcohol. This movie shows it all. It really saddens me that the father who is stuck in the past worrying about the Mauri and how he was nothing lets his family get the worst of him. Also he subjects his children and wife to danger, which is really disheartening especially when Grace gets personally attacked under his watchful eye, which leads to her death. I believe through the course of this film the mother, Beth, starts to understand and feels guilt for have abandoning her children and was trying to reconnect. The only way to change would have to leave the place that has been the source of evil and if it wasn't for Grace dying I don't believe Beth would have ever been able to get her family out away from the abusive and alcoholic father. The Mauri traditions seem to be very warrior oriented whether it is the tattoos you wear on your face like Nig, or like Boogie who had to leave of the house and got put into welfare. It was the best thing for him. He got in touch with his culture and he grew as a person. The ending when Beth grows and decides to leave with the close up of her face in the dark night with the light shining through really shows her inner warrior because when I think of a warrior that is the exact image that comes into my head. She has defeated the beast and it is now time to go home. This movie is tragic and yet heroic. It was a real eye opener.",

A story that shows what happens when men and women become marginalized. This story is haunting. It is not for the faint of heart to watch nor for the person who minimizes the negative effects of mental, physical and emotional trauma. With its moments of triumph and struggle to find comfort within its messed up world the story leaves the viewer broken hearted. Broken hearted because it shows a condition of humanity that occurs when people are brutalized, for when people are brutalized they learn to brutalize. After a point this is all they know. For a small few of these brutal people there is an effort to return to where they came from. Reclaim what is left of their former selves. Find meaning in who they were meant to be and salvage what is left.

            "content": "Once Were Warriors is, at its core, a film about the universal problems faced by all people who face poverty and disenfranchisement by the mainstream society. Jake the Muss is one of the rawest depictions the violent, uneducated, brutal, alcoholic, wife- beating protagonist. He brought depth to a character that would otherwise be written off as the typical one sided abusive husband. Temuera Morrison showed us the different facets of a person who was downtrodden by society, had no chances for the conventional education that many people take for granted, and who exists in a society where the tough survive and the weak perish. It is not an excuse for his behavior, but it is within the parameters of his limitations that we see a person who has unconsciously allowed himself to be a victim of circumstance because of his ignorance and the rationalization for his behavior of those around him. The daughter, Grace, as her name implies is the one pure character in the story, which saves the rest of her family by her death. After her rape, she sacrifices her life so that her brothers and sisters to not have to experience what she has and, I believe, so that her mother, Beth, can finally take the last steps to extract the family from the poisonous influence of Jake, his lifestyle, and his friends. As, I watched the film, I kept wondering how the children's experience of growing up in such a situation would effect them in the future. I could easily imagine Jake the Muss at five years old, witnessing his father beat his mother, and the connection is quite clear how he became an abusive husband himself. The same can be said for Boogie, and the younger siblings of the family. Growing up in such and environment and without the prospect of other possibilities or even the knowledge of such possibilities would place them onto a path that is in the same footsteps as Jake and Beth. This film is the most realistic depiction of domestic abuse and should be studied more closely, not necessarily for its cinematic value, which it has in spaces, but for its potential to teach others about the reality of those domestic situations, which even in the \"west\" we often choose to ignore or sidestep.",

On the other side, you are compelled by the power of Beth, who fights against this situation and her husband. Her strength makes it possible to find another way for her and her children.There are some downsides to this movie : the violent scenes tend to be copied by people, who have the same problems.

The reasons that the Heke family live a life of turmoil and poverty can be debated, but the bigger question to ask is why this family does not see any other alternative for themselves. Beth does not have the resolve to seek out a better life for herself until disaster strikes. This is not only a tale of a woman's struggle in a violent home, but it is also a story about family and holding on to one's roots, or identity. The title Once Were Warriors is perfect.

He appears to be the king of the castle, until his world caves in. Rena Owen plays his wife, and she gives a wonderfully rounded, strong performance in a demanding role as an abused woman who hangs on to her children. One too many late night, drunken parties at home leads to the ultimate tragedy which rips into the family almost to the breaking point. From there, Beth finally puts her foot down and starts to question everything. The ending is a shockingly nasty bloody scene, but it also leaves the viewer feeling that things really are going to work out for Beth and her kids. It stirs the pot, and makes no attempts to add beauty, ease or comfort, for anyone's sake. The violence is not without purpose, as it feels more than a \"reality\" driving the cautionary tale home. There is some healing and cleansing, transformation, rebirth, & renewal, in the sacred act of traversing this tale. All in all, a movie to watch but be aware of some extreme violence.",

This is violence showing the reality of domestic violence happening for real, all around the world. Jake character is very very interesting. I wish the director made another movie about Jack's childhood. What type of environment turned this guy in to a sick brutal macho? We can see that he feels some love for his wife and children, but for some reason he can not be a real man and take care of his family. I think its because he did not have a good father figure. I think family issues such as domestic violence are vicious circles. The children who are raised by domestic violence and carelessness will use domestic violence and be careless. Movie shows that there is a way to break this vicious circle, education provided by social services. The kid who was taken by social services in the movie gets discipline and self respect by training haka. I am hundred percent sure that that kid will not become a Jake in the future. Governments in developed countries should always keep an eye on the ghettos and rehabilitate these kids and their parents, if they can. In underdeveloped countries?

The smaller children are just following a path that will most likely perpetuate the life that there parents are living. The film does a great job of seemingly being hopeless.

It takes you from emotional highs to emotional lows. It begs the question, are there justifiable violence or is violence just violence?The main focus of the movie shows a family who have long been separated from their cultural heritage. Drowned in booze, ignorance, and denial - the family struggles to find a balance they can be satisfied with. When one of the sons of the family is taken away by social custody, it sets in motion a change that will eventually lead to a reunion with their cultural ancestry. Complex characters and portrayals makes you empathetic and judgemental at the same time. One could be quick to judge the characters for their weaknesses, but at the same time they have many strengths too.The feeling that the movie left me with was a wish, an envy, to identify more strongly with my own cultural heritage. I feel as though Once Were Warriors left off with most of the characters stronger, wiser, and happier through their renewed self-identification. One might say it is a powerful identity that only seem to spark during times of struggle.Overall the movie was great, the acting was great, it was very dramatic and indeed made me feel very emotional. I smiled and I cringed. Although the movie felt so conveniently 'closed', without much else to explore, it gave a lot to think about.

Not because perhaps we see the characters for who they are and how they are affected by physical brutality but because New Zealand's once proud Maori nation have become a sub group within their own country. Integrated to a certain extent but still under the casting eye of the new white state they now embrace. The antagonist and forceful Jake is from a long line of slaves we are told yet deep down there too lurks a certain pride in his Maori past and a frustration born out of the effects of his own violence towards his family. He certainly has a charm about him but we soon realise this is fleeting. He is a vicious character, doomed to a life of hate. Most of his friends have become a part of this poor sub group, though they seem less prone to violence than him.This is not to excuse his physical brutality though. His wife has moral strength and real pride in her traditions, which seems to gradually filter down to her children, themselves under Jake's reign of terror. Yet they gradually grasp the true strengths of their past and leave their father to swear, drink and fight his way to an ultimate life of self-misery. Perhaps the director was seeking a general re-birth amongst his people, realising that his generation has lost to the Western influences but the Maori youth still have the time and freedom to regain that pride and also embrace the Western influences. A quest for regeneration then or perhaps it is just a film of paternal violence and its tragic effects, like that in any country or society, old or new.

New Zealand, before being conquered by the British, was inhabited by the Maoris. These Maoris are basically the blacks of New Zealand. \"Once were Warriors\" shows how education is so important to society because it teaches us not to be animals. The New Zealand ghettos in this movie were filled with children that did not have school and were always getting into trouble. However, the one person that wanted to learn, Gracie, was displayed as a human being with moral value and wanted to spread goodness through her journal with stories, which very much represented a bible. It also shows how giving money out to people is not always the best way to take care of them. And that ones that do work should be rewarded a bit more handsomely, or else we will be littered with bums that rely on others for support.I really loved this movie because the people in the movie were not willing to change until the most important, civilized person in the movie had to comment an act of self sacrifice, much like Jesus, in order to make everyone self-reflect.",

The clothes and music scream 90's and there are many strange moments, most with drunken singing. Looking passed its faults the film really has a great story and fantastic acting. Rena Owen, Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, and Temuera Morrison give memorable, heartbreaking performances that give a sense of reality to the story. I don't know much about New Zealand and its past, but from this film you get a glimpse into the history and culture of the Maori people. There's a kind of ceremonial chant and dance that the boys learned at school that they perform toward the end of the film that I found very moving.",

            "content": "It is beyond belief that the man behind Once were Warriors (his debut) is the same man who has mostly recently brought us such films as Next and XXX 2. Wow what happened? Unlike his most recent attempts at blockbusters \"Warriors\" is a masterfully made film for the most part. There are some minor exceptions but overall the film succeeds in pulling us into a world other then are own and keeping us there through all the highs and lows. The film has a very original look and feel to it that makes us comfortable even in an ugly setting as the one where our poor Maori family is living in. But that changes as this microcosm becomes more and more unbearable.We open up with our setting (the dirty industrial wasteland), which in its own right is one of the characters. We meet Beth the mother who we can consider our main character even though the rest of the family members do go through their own personal journeys. Soon after we meet Boogie the son on a downward spiral towards becoming a hood. His Sister Grace the hopeful poet and story teller. Then finally we meet Jake, now despite his lovable charm we hate Jake. It's more then easy to focus all the hate on Jake for he is the source of everything that's wrong with the family. He represents the factors keeping the Maoris in this setting; low income, poor education and senseless violence. Where as Grace is his polar opposite, representing hope. Can hope help these people break out of the prison that is Jake's attributes. I think that is the main question behind the film. This film won't steadily lead you from a grim reality to a happy one or vise versa. It's a struggle for the characters throughout the film as they keep diving in and out of a dysfunctional and dangerous pool until finally the most pure of characters doesn't make it out. This death becomes a beautiful rebirth as the character that symbolized hope dies. And a real hope is born for Beth and the rest of her Children as she gathers up the strength to protect her babies from the Tyrant Jake. Overall the Film is a must see that will leave with you after the credits have rolled.",

            "content": "Once were Warriors is an intense film to watch because of its graphic violence, but the violence actually serves for greater purpose, in order to enhance the story. Very few films reveal a convincing abusive family type story. This film is great because it shows the complexity of trying to survive in a rural environment. What makes this film great is that the story is universal. Anyone that comes from a hard background, regardless of country, can relate to the struggles that these individuals are faced with. They are searching for their identity, and what path to take to live their life. While growing up, one is always struggling to find what kind of person one wishes to be, and what kind of peer group one wishes to be apart of. Grace is a multifaceted character because regardless of her abusive parents, she manages to be a caring person who loves her family and wishes for her family to live together in peace and harmony. When they go to visit Buggie, it reveals some sign of hope that it is possible for her wish to come true.",

            "content": "Once Were Warriors is a heartbreaking film about a family that is being torn apart. At first, you wouldn't think they were - it's pleasant enough at first. But then we see Jake continually drawn in by alcohol and he doesn't even realize it. Beth starts as a completely passive woman who is spurned into action - and by action, I mean leaving Jake - by her daughter's, Grace, suicide. Not only is it a film about family that's dealing with alcoholism, abuse, rape, and suicide, it's also dealing with their M\u0101ori heritage. Two of their children, Nig and Buggie, both go about it different ways, but in the end, they grow from children to men through their culture. But really, it's Beth's assertiveness in the end, where she tells Jake that she's leaving him to go back to her village with their children, that makes such a strong case for her identity. She knows who she is and knows that it's because of her M\u0101ori heritage that gives her the strength to leave Jake.This film sheds some light onto a people that are mostly known (as far as I know) for their tattoos: T\u0101 moko. It's a beautiful, yet incredibly violent film that showcases the M\u0101ori people and their culture. If you have a chance to see the film, I saw go for it. You really won't regret it.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of epic tragedy. The main reason is sitting back to see someone who does not expect to have their life turned inside-out for my pure sadistic entertainment. I was able to catch this movie in my film class with many people I would consider to have normal conformity to society's moral values. The story follows Beth and her family living in New Zealand. The husband, Jake the Muss a.k.a. Jango Fett from Starwars, who is an overly macho/abusive man who gets fired from his job to further torment his family from home. The two sons are drop outs from school, once of which joins a gang to get the respect from a family that he is neglected at home. And the only beacon of hope of the family resides in the heart of the daughter, Grace. If it is unclear to you what is going to happen, I will tell you: everything that can go wrong, goes wrong and the final objective is to destroy that dimly lit hope in Grace by rape and hanging. I was tentatively watching this movie expecting a feel good, sensational movie that would life my spirit into nirvana and the plants would align, bring peace to a once conflicted world. Fortunately I was wrong. The first plot point of the movie hits the audience as hard as a fist that hits Beth in the face. Jake the husband invites a lot of his friends over to his house and party, serving food and drinks for everyone. Everyone is singing and dancing until Beth refuses to make eggs for one of Jake's friends Uncle Bully (Hint: this friend later rapes the daughter Grace). Jake has a conniption and proceeds to physically assault Misses Jake the Muss. He then takes her to the bedroom and essentially rapes her with all of his blind rage. The sad part I believe is that this outburst does not seem like the first one this family has seen. The next morning Beth wakes with a badly bruised and bloody face. She is supposed to go to court in defense of her hooligan son, but decides it best that the court officials do not see her a victim of domestic violence. The shocking and almost comedic moment occurs when Jake finally wakes up to see Beth and mocks her appearance and tells her to wash up. In addition to his rude behavior, his discovery of his son being taken away into protective custody escapes his sympathetic ability. The second plot point hits a awkward cord for most still keeping their eyes open during this roller-coaster ride. The friend of Jake, Uncle Bully, sneaks into Grace's room during another of Jake's parties to rape 14 year old grace. This entire scene is shot with no cuts, and the audience really gets the sick, twisted and psychological torment that Grace is going through. At this moment in the film, I really was wondering if the director/writer invested in any redeeming moments by the film's end. Sadly for me, yes. Grace wrote of her unfortunate rape in her diary that turned into the reason why this movie did not earn a 10/10 for me. Grace wallows in her misery to her parents neglectful watch. Grace decides to take matters into her own hands and hangs herself on the backyard tree. When Beth discovers her daughter's body, the image is sickening and wonderful. The mother gets one of Jake's friends to cut her down and ends with Beth holding Grace in her arms, crying for failing her as a parent and a decent human being. I said the diary was the reason that this movie ended poorly in my opinion. The good old Hollywood ending finds its way into this film and the journal acts as the deciding factor of vengeance that the nearly guilt-free uncle Bully. Beth discovers the diary and shows it to Jake, causing his clockwork rampage, only this time directed towards uncle Bully. Finished tying up her lose end, Beth finally grows the confidence to leave her abusive husband Jake only after her daughter dies. That diary really prohibited this movie from becoming memorable. Because of the happy ending, I choose to forget it like ever other Spielberg, Michael Bay movie out there. This movie almost achieved greatness but tripped ten feet from the finish line. I did enjoy the ride while it lasted. How many movies can most people think of that makes them cry or upset or angry for a series for stills on a big flat scene?",

He often invites huge crowds of friends back from the bar to his home for crazy parties. While Jake seems to be an easy going man out for a good time, he has a vicious temper when drinking. His drinking problems provoke him to be a savage and attack his wife in front of their friends. There are particular films you can watch and understand the concept of each plot and setting. As I analyzed this film I was angry to see the acts of \"The Muss\" you see a man hit his wife and it hits you in the gut like you're being hit yourself. This is a great example of poverty, violence and anger that occurs in a low income family. Coming from poverty myself I have witnessed similar situations in Hispanic families that aggravate a person because they want to become better but feel like there is no better than what they already have. In this case, they happen to be Maoris living in New Zealand. The father dominates the family because he is so powerless in the other facets of his life. He's addicted to boozing and carousing and the only way he can really express himself is with his fists the wife fights back, but is beaten. But she's also allowed herself to be seduced by the fears of responsibility. The oldest daughter who is the only one who can communicate with all of her family. While the boys are completely distraught with rage inside of them. The youngest daughter is just too young to comprehend and clings to her sister. It takes a tragedy to allow some of these individuals to reach out for each other and try to re-create a form of family life. I thought this was a very powerful film that makes you realize that there are actually families living in this type of condition.",

The father spends his time getting drunk at the bar, fighting with bar patrons, throwing party's, etc... He has abandoned his roots and where he has come from. He wants to have nothing to do with his language, culture, or customs. Unfortunately when we stray from where we come from we do not have much to hold on to. The movie teaches us through his sons that its important to get back to their Maori culture. We need to stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and bring down their blessings. If we try to make it on our own merit than we will be consumed by the world. In order to rise above the world and break out of their conditions they must remember who they are. They have become like animals like rabid dogs. We see what drinking can do to a family. The answer is not in the bottle but in their traditions and language.

The movie is an adaptation of Alan Duff's novel but screenplay was written by Riwia Brown, a female, which is interesting to note since the film ends up having a strong feminine voice to it. For one, the story ends up being told from a woman's (Beth) perspective. The cinematography by Driver is also very expressive and there's much to analyze from just one scene. The opening scene where we see the billboard resembles that scene of perfection but then as we zoom out we get reality. We've seen this scene many times before in other movies like What's Cooking. However, the real impact of the film came with Grace's rape and thus suicide. It is truly tragic because poverty is not what is keeping this Maori family from being able to move on, it's the loss of cultural identity and really education/guidance. The last thing I admired about this movie is the violence. The violence is not gratuitous and serves its purpose. It is straightforward and natural even to the point that it is uncomfortable to watch, but the rawness of it is fresh and rather liberating. Rena Owen (who plays Beth) and Temuera Morrison (who plays Jake the muss) deliver a commendable and rather impressive performance (especially for Morrison, who is used to playing the \"good doctor\" roles).",

Tamahori does an amazing job expressing and showing what reality is about, not every family has this story but behind close doors violence is hidden. This film has a power to make you cry with the characters, smile, laugh, and even hate wishing life wasn't so hard. This is such a memorable film although its heartbreaking is unforgettable.

Why must we be expected to applaud gratuitous mayhem when it is disguised in this way?\nThat we are asked to sit through the kind of scenes that have the owners of XXX-rated video stores arrested when it appears in their product is bad enough, but to have to see it so amateurishly performed is an unconscionable insult to one's intelligence.The depiction of violence, of any variety, can be a legitimate story-telling device, but is exceptionally difficult to do well, even by the most seasoned of professionals: the performers in this crudely produced film appear to have been whisked away from a street corner somewhere and asked to swear at a camera as foully as they possibly can.

At least that's how I prescribed it to be. I was deeply sad to see Beth beaten by Jake (The Muss) because she didn't do a certain flavor he told her too do. Almost everyone of this family hated or was terrified by Jake the father. Beth was no puppet to be controlled as anyone pleased. The only reason she stayed around was because of her children. If it weren't for them she would have been gone. Beth was a strong warrior, having dealt with Jake for almost eighteen years and taking a stand for what she & her true were about. Beth was not about violence or aggressive behavior but a mom who cared for her family's well being. Her spirit came alive at the moment where she decided to walk away from all the negativity and drama from her husband. Jake(The Muss) was a coward but the Superior warrior here was Beth for taking her stand and not letting anyone treat her like a carpet.

This is exemplified mostly in the characters of the father Jake Heke and his two delinquent sons Nig and Mark \u2013 a.k.a. \"Boogie\". This film shows very clearly how a life of confusion, alcohol abuse, and utter violence can result when people either never were in touch with their cultural heritage or just do not show much interest or respect for their cultural past to do so. An interesting point in the film is when Jake Heke does not even want his daughter to be buried traditionally among her ancestors. \"Once Were Warriors\" is a classic example of how cultural alienation can cause some people to be at odds with themselves and not know who they are inside. This film shows not only how people suffering from cultural alienation causes them to be disconnected from their roots \u2013 but how when people are disconnected from their roots they also become disconnected from themselves.",

What was interesting about this film was that it portrays the effects of colonization on a group of people after a long period of time. The way the Maori demographic turned out is a very interesting sociological phenomenon. One of the issues that this movie deals with is the problems of identity when it comes to colonization. The ones that are colonized must more or less lose their native culture. We see characters get in touch with their native sides and others completely shunning it away. Along with their problems of social identification, the movie deals with problems that can be relevant to many people across the world; domestic abuse and rebellion are among the dark themes the movie explores.

Jake loves to drink and throw punches, especially at his wife when she doesn't keep her mouth shut.

There may have been other reasons for her suicide but I won't get into those. If Gracie didn't kill herself the family wouldn't have left Jake and they would have lived a sad and depressing life. A message in this movie is sometimes self-sacrifice is the only way to open eyes at how bad a situation can be.As I said at the beginning this movie shows how important love and dreams are. I believe one of the reasons the older sons are involved with crime is they have no hopes or aspirations. Education is usually what stimulates hope and I believe that's what is lacking in this family.

It showed the raw and unfortunate struggle of a mother fighting to keep her marriage together, but is too weak and prideful to leave her abusive husband. I felt that this film touched many topics that needed to be reached regarding ethnicity, discrimination, abuse, and how the lack of education can create more issues than ever because people are not aware of how to express themselves and even search for a better way of life. The acting is incredible, and the lessons learned by the end of the movie are extremely moving.",

The raw style of filmography makes you appreciate Tamahori's honest approach in allowing the film to tell the story of the Maori people. The character transformation that Beth embarks on is a roller coaster that takes you on emotional highs and lows.

            "content": "The idea death and the universal fear of losing one's life was greatly seen in this movie. I think as humans adapt to the changing world, people tend to form this unconscious fear of death itself. However this movie clearly exemplified how death is not the end. A tragedy more often than not is the only wake up call that can start changes. Sadly something extreme is the only thing that can arouse people's realization of their wrong doings. This film is very effective emotionally and socially. People should bear in mind that even though the modern world introduces us to more civilized and advanced things; we must not forget to remember where we came from more importantly ---culture.This film further touches the outcome of colonialism and also globalization/westernization. I found it refreshing to watch a movie regarding an indigenous culture of the Maoris. I thought that there was this element of cognitive dissonance in relation to Beth played by Rene Owen. To me she kept on coming up with reasons to justify the domestic physical and emotional abuse her husband (Morrison) does to her. At certain scenes I would cringe because of the violent actions Morrison illustrates. It really saddens me how a man can just hit a person whom he loves at point blank as if that person was not a human being at all. Beth would just take the beating as if she deserved it. On top of that it so ridiculous how she can still face her husband knowing that he is capable of killing her.This movie depicts so much domestic abuse and as an audience I truly empathized with the children. I could only imagine going through such circumstance of having such a dysfunctional household and coping with adolescence. I strongly believe that if you don't think you can provide your children with an ideal life in terms of emotional caress and love then you should not have brought them into this world. You don't have to be financially rich or stable to be good parents. All that children need is affection, love and emotion. This film also covered a strong sense of cultural identity for the Maoris. The visceral language of the Maoris sounded beautiful to my ears. I admire how much Beth was able to retain such strong sense of identity.Overall I would say this struck me mostly in terms of reaching one's full potential or in humanistic psychological approach to \"self-actualize\". I think that this movie serves as a great reminder for the youth that no matter how tragic one's life is, one is still capable of reaching peace and success. It all lies in one's inner strength meaning mentally and emotionally. If you put your mind into channeling out positive actions then you can truly accomplish and endure anything even a tragic loss of a loved one just like how Beth loss her daughter Grace. I also think that this movie conquers a whole lot with making sacrifices and consideration for others.This movie I must say really had such kick. The cinematic violence in accordance with actors' performance was stupendously admirable. I thought the violence used was effective in bringing out the message on domestic violence as well as possessing a strong cultural identity.",

The film is about the Maori culture who have some of the most amazing traditions and are absolutely beautiful people.

I've lived in New Zealand and was privileged to be immersed in the Maori culture. I witnessed a race proud of their heritage and who respect themselves and others.

The best part of the movie was that I was able to connect to the movie personally, but this wasn't the only reason that made this one of my favorite movies. I fell in love with this movie for how great the character development was for many of the characters in the movie. I felt the pain and the joy of the characters as they went through their turmoils and victory. The two older brothers were very well developed in very short amount of scenes, where they grew from immature children into reliable men. Even though the two went through different events in order to reach this conclusion, they reached it using their Maori culture. This was great because, I was able to see the whole family (excluding Jake) as a single character who in turn returns to the Maori culture where they belong, when the family decides to go live with Beth's family. Beth was another character that was developed greatly. She started off as a uneducated woman that thought she was supposed to \"keep her mouth shut, and her legs open,\" into a independent woman that didn't need Jake anymore. My favorite character development had to be Grace. She was set up as the conscious of the family that looked after the family. I was able totally sympathize her. Even when she took her own life away I thought that her actions were justified due to what has happened to her and what results her actions brought upon her family. Over all I thought that this was a great movie, the music through out the movie was excellent as well as the non-glorified and very realistic violent scenes.",

I have rarely been so disappointed in a movie, particularly given the high rating on IMDb.The dialogue feels like it was written by high school kids trying to come up with a school play. For example, in one early brief scene, we learn that a fifteen year old looks forward to being old enough to get \"on the dole.\" Even if true, the way in which this was presented to the viewer was so one dimensional that it was awful.

            "content": "\"Once Were Warriors,\" can be quite difficult to watch. From the beginning you can sense that this is a family with problems and it only becomes more clear as the film goes on. The family is headed by Jake, a brutal and short tempered man who will often resort to violence as his first solution. The mother of the family is Beth, who descends from Maori royalty, she struggles with her life decisions and maintaining the well being of her children. The film has a lot to do with the class system established by Maori culture. Jake is a descendant from slaves and resents his wife's family for not approving of him. This makes him feel like a lesser man which he compensates for by being extremely aggressive. His feelings of inferiority cause him to physically and even sexually dominate his wife in order to preserve his masculinity. The scenes where Jake punches his wife with a closed fist are almost painful to watch because they look very realistic. At first the film shows the family and their flaws which are redeemed by the daughter character, Grace. Grace enjoys reading and writing stories and it's her only escape from her life. She is the only redeemable character for most of the film but this all turns tragic when she commits suicide after being raped by a friend of her father's. In the end, Grace redeems almost all of the characters with her death. Her mother is able to escape Jake's tyranny and go back to her family. Jake is most likely thrown in prison for killing his friend who raped her, which is the only way to redeem himself because he is in part responsible for her death. The rest of the family is brought closer by these events and Grace's homeless best friend is even included into the family. In the end the film is extremely tragic and leaves you in a state of dismay.",

Even more offensive than the violence is the scene where two of the female characters, one of whom (Beth) is grossly disfigured from a fresh beating, joke and LAUGH about the beating as if it were a normal and ACCEPTABLE part of everyday life. While the main message of the movie is women's empowerment with an underlying theme of the importance of education to break out of the monotony of the Maori life, the empowerment theme is somewhat undercut by the portrayal of Beth's character as a bright and emotionally strong woman who, for some unknown reason, tolerates abuse for 18 years. UNIMAGINABLE! From the pure perspective of psychology, the message might be misconstrued by abused women as being that there is little hope for change, because if a strong woman will take abuse for 18 years and will only make a change when tragedy strikes, how can a weak woman ever break away. In this regard, the movie does some disservice to the plight of the victims of domestic violence. On the other hand, it does give hope for change in showing that the next generation will likely reject this type of life.",

But unlike Los Olvidados, Once were warriors is able to show the characters grow in strength as a result of the death of a family member. Beth is able to find the resolve to confront her oppressor for the sake of protecting her remaining children. This message is what I think is the main point of Once Were Warriors.

Jake, the Muss, is an iconic strong character, stereotypically wife beater and bad father; yet, despite the immense negative qualities the character possesses, in society and around his friends, strangers, he is seen as a strong character, almost admired by society. The movie brings up the question why individuals such as Jake are admired? I think characters such as Jake are constantly stirred into and exposed throughout society, movies, books; adapting to it's time, place, and location. The movie sends a powerful message and opens our eyes to the Maori culture, their life in New Zealand, and why the vicious cycle never ends. Children are exposed to the behavior of their parents; the household and education are the ingredients to the problem. The children learn from them, and it is gradually melted into their minds and family, the cycle never ends. The movie is not meant to be glamorous, but raw, stirring the emotion of the audience continually. The somewhat happy ending of the wife leaving Jake with the children is rare; nonetheless, never too late. Grace's death was both a tragedy; yet, her death allowed the wife to open her eyes and gather the strength to leave.

Very different from the typical \"disfunctional family\", each of the individuals' actions can be interpreted as their own way of connecting to their own perception of Maori culture. Each character has the capacity to step out of the screen and become an actual individual. Everyone has their own dramatic premise to meet, giving the characters a realism that is harshly juxtaposed to the lunacy of the situations that they are forced into. Because of this, the cruelest actions appear believable, and as a result the messages of the film hits much harder.

Unless you get turned on by spousal and child abuse as well as child molesting, then DO NOT see this movie.  Save your money.  Don't even take it if someone offers it to you for free.",

The story-line is about the Maori people of Austrailia, and shows how they lives have changed, yet they are still stong, even through adversity and hardship. The film can be seen that no matter how your life has turned out, you still have your pride and dignity and no one can take that away no matter what happens. A film that should be in every collection, and even in the schools around the world as the story is so powerful.",

When I was first introduced to Jake The Muss I thought he the local \"good\" guy even because he beat up a guy who was causing trouble at the bar Jake and his friends were in, but my perspective on him changed when he and his wife started to fight over eggs and he ends up beating her up and finally raping her. Intense scenes come throughout the movie to the point where you start to get paranoid because you don't know if Jake is going to do anything violent or any kind dangerous surprise. This is an great movie because the family in the movie went through a lot even the death of a sibling. But at the end the family became strong.",

My absolute favorite part of this movie is when Beth comes with her son to confront Jake about their dead daughter's rape and rapist. Then Jake goes and kicks the crap out f Uncle Bully!! Totally rad moment!! This move just embodies what a general good move is. Its definitely a drama that everyone should watch.This movie just insanely rocks.Watch it!",

            "content": "This movie is really a literally knock out. We get to see a lot of violence all thru the movie and one has to question where all this violence stem from. Even though the Maori people have a great tradition of big and strong warriors I don't think they used the kind of violence we get to witness in Once were warriors. I think the kind of violence Jake the Muss uses and the hatred he carries must come from a loss of identity. Jake the Muss loves his family, there's no doubt about that. But he doesn't know how to show his love. This makes sense, because Jake doesn't seem to know whom he is and the angst that creates takes the force of this super violence. It is almost like Jake hates himself and if he could he'd probably beat the living hell out of himself. In Once Were Warriors, director Lee Tanahori makes a brilliant job in depicting a people robbed of their identity and culture. Tanahori doesn't lay any blame on the colonizers, but I think he sends an important message of what happens to people who have to chose between the old traditional kind of living or to adapt to a new culture. As a side note I must say that I love when Jake, this huge masculine guy, sings with his wife Beth. That's something you don't see everyday.",

The film mixed my emotions and really made me reflect various situations that occurs in our life. The film mixes great elements together as rock n roll, natives and their traditions, spirituality and martial arts. I recommend for everyone this film because it is real and it deals with important subject matters.The acting in the film is real well done. Inpeacable. It really made me look back at our society and think of how we live and why we live the way we live. How our minorities really suffer, and that they don't live the way they do just because they are the way they are. Yet there is a much deeper reason why the minorities not just in New Zealand yet speaking of all the minorities in the world in which once were natives and lived well. In New Zealand we can clearly see that the English came and took over. Raped the Maoris traditions and imposed theirs.",

            "review_title": "A Tough but Moving Experience",
            "content": "Lee Tamahori's Once Were Warriors is a visceral, raw and powerful film. This screenplay about a Maori family was adapted by Alan Dodd from a novel by Rivia Brown. It's a very tough film to watch as it shows domestic violence realistically without holding anything back. All of the character flaws in this film essentially stem from violence. Whenever there is any kind of problem (which is practically all the time), this family resorts to violence in a desperate and illogical reach for a solution. Temuera Morrison plays Jake the Muss who is a terrifying, vicious man that doesn't hesitate for a second to brutally beat his wife Beth if she does so much as look at him the wrong way. What's the wrong way? Who knows. There isn't much of a method to his mayhem. There is no telling when he will explode. Beth reaches a point where she will no longer take it any more as she tells her husband that she won't come out of her room and join the party. She will no longer associate with the people involved in her husband's lifestyle. Interestingly, as much of a tyrant Jake is, he never once cheats on his wife. His ability to remain faithful to her adds a fascinating dynamic to his character which makes him more three-dimensional. As a result of this extreme domestic violence, their children Nig, Boogie and Grace are quite disconnected from the traditional family unit. They struggle to find a place for themselves, an identity, and a chance to belong and feel accepted. The oldest son, Nig, joins a street gang where they tattoo their entire bodies to the point where they resemble an alien species. The younger son, Boogie, begins a life of crime very early on in his development. The court sends him to an institution where his teacher helps him get back in touch with his cultural roots. Although, Beth plans on visiting her son Boogie, Jake ruins those plans. The heart of this tragic story lies in the actions of their daughter Grace. After being raped by her uncle, she is so devastated that she sees no point in living any longer. As an interesting shot involving men lifting weights and using a punching bag in a dark alley shows, Grace would have been fine living on the streets. However, her home life is very unsafe. Therefore, she commits suicide by hanging herself from the backyard tree. Her suicide is seen as a self-sacrifice for the betterment of the essence of her community. She is something of a martyr for the Maori people. All of the performance in this film are fantastic, particularly those of Beth and Jake played by Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison respectively. I was surprised to learn that Morrison plays a lovable George Clooney from E.R.-esquire doctor on the popular New Zealand television series \"Shortland Street.\" This shows the range of his ability as an actor. Unfortunately, director Lee Tamahori's track record has been less than stellar. Instead of following up Once Were Warriors with equally terrific films, he proceeded to make the James Bond film Die Another Day, the significantly disappointing sequel to the already disappointing action flick XXX, and the abysmal Nicholas Cage film last year called Next. Hopefully, he'll return to his roots someday because, although it can be very tough to watch, Once Were Warriors is an incredible film.",

True, a movie is to an extent the product of a specific era, but there were times watching this when it seemed I was watching a bad grunge rock music video.Beyond the superficial problems I also found the acting and script to be lacking. During the moments of intensity the film found its purpose but during the interludes of calm there were clich\u00e9s and bad TV drama acting abound. I felt the actress playing Grace was particularly disappointing.Sometimes when lesser-known actors are used for films such as this it gives a film a look of authenticity - when it works. But in this case it makes some scenes seem very amateurish.There were real moments of drama and, as I mentioned before, intensity which kept me watching and I felt Jake had an aura of danger, power and volatility in most scenes, but overall I was rather disappointed with this film which does get high recommendations from all and sundry.",
