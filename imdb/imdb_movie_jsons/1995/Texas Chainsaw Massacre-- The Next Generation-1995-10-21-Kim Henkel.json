            "content": "Ok look I know it's bad, I do. I'm not saying that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a great film. All I'm saying is that it's a guilty pleasure of mine... like I had a lot of fun here! To me, this is just one of those films where you know it's bad while you're watching it, but you're just never bored and you're having fun. You got two leads who were very young at the time, who would later become Oscar winning A list actors.... that's pretty shocking to see in a film like this lol. I loved Renee Zellweger here, I actually think she and Matthew are the only good actors here, the rest are pretty laughable. But ya know this film really doesn't take itself very seriously at all, so it's fun to laugh at the atrocious acting, mainly given by the actress that plays Heather. Matthew McConaughey is absolutely bonkers here, like sometimes he's just crazy to be crazy. That's one of the many reasons this film is never boring... it's entertaining as hell to watch Matthew play this crazy over the top character. I had fun with the chainsaw chase scenes and actually did get kinda tense while Leatherface was chasing Jenny. I have absolutely no clue why Leatherface is a transvestite in this film, that's just one of the weird things they put in here, like the mechanical leg and the weird government thing. But overall, I think this film knows what it is and it just goes completely off the rails crazy. It's a guilty pleasure for me, I'm not saying this film is good, but I can't deny that I did have fun watching it.",

            "content": "Well said, Rothman. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it fails on every level. It's not scary, it's not disturbing, it's not entertaining, it's only funny periodically when you can't believe how stupid it is, and it essentially killed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later. The only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads - Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey - who were young and naive back then, but they did they best they could with the material they had. Renee played a fine damsel in distress and McConaughey was perfect as an insane cannibalistic psychopath. You can tell he was having fun with the part, and the fun he has is contagious sometimes especially knowing how huge he has become since. The movie itself is downright horrendous. It starts off as a typical slasher: a few teens leaving prom get stranded in the woods, then they encounter strange characters, and from then it devolves into a nonsensical screaming battle between everyone. Literally there are scenes in this movie where the only lines are \"AHHHH!\" Leatherface has gone full transvestite for this installment. They also end the movie with some sort of conspiracy that these cannibals have been around for thousands of years and there are men in suits that check up on them or something. It makes absolutely no sense and trying to piece it together will ensure a loss of brain cells.This is the worst of the pre-millennial TCMs by a long shot. Only watch if you're a die-hard TCM completist or you want to watch McConaughey yell like crazy for a while. Either way, you're bound to be disappointed.",

            "content": "I decided to watch the original \"Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE\", TCM 2, LEATHERFACE TCM 3 and TCM 4 in a row. I already seen the two first and I think they're great. But Leatherface and TCM 4 were new to me. Leatherface was extremely flat and boring but TCM 4 was, well, INSANELY BAD. I simply could not believe what I was watching. My jaw was on the floor. Is this a movie? It's a joke, right? I never laughed so much in a very long time. There are simply no words to describe how bizarre, SURREAL, and bad this movie is. Nothing makes sense so there's no point of trying to make sense of it. It's insane. Insanely bad. Insanely funny. Insanely directed. Insanely insulting to the whole series. Insanely watchable AND unwatchable. Yes, it's INSANELY entertaining to the masochist in me, who likes to witness the worst of the worst in movies, and TCM 4 is WRETCHED to the nth degree! It feels like the Hitchhiker from the original TCM directed this \"movie\". I have to admit that as bad as TCM 4 is, at least it's looks and feels more like the TCM world created by Tobe Hooper than the ultra boring and flat looking LEATHERFACE TCM 3.There are so many moments in TCM 4 that have to be seen to be believed. The funniest being the moment when Renee and Matthew are battling over remotes that controls Matthew's piston powered leg (got that?). Or the funny scene of Leatherface (a cross-dresser here) standing behind clueless Heather and playing with her hair. Heather has to be one of the funniest characters I've ever seen. She's played by Lisa Marie Newmyer, who's a bimbo but with a lot of insight. In this \"movie\", Heather is attacked by Leatherface, placed in a freezer. Then she's hung on a hook, and for some unexplained reason, she got off the hook and tried to crawl away from the house only to be brought back to the house, where she lies on the floor, too bored or lazy to runaway. LOL!!! The whole thing is played as a comedy. But the comedy is often so bizarre that it's not really funny. What's also remarkable is that Renee and Matthew do have \"star quality\" and watching these \"stars\" in this insane movie just adds a lot more bizarre, wonky quality to the movie than it really deserved. The whole cast is game but I wonder, what did the director or producers do to have the cast go all out like that? Was it drugs? Was the whole crew and cast on drugs or drunk?!?! Matthew is very good in his role as, well, I don't know, a buff psycho? And Renee goes all out in her role as \"survivor\", running across the forest like an athlete trying to win a medal.After I watched TCM4 for a second time, I've finally realized that it's all flippant parody of the first movie. I've noticed bizarre details, like the sound of crickets during the opening scene inside Jenny's house. The director, who co-wrote the original TCM, didn't take this new foray into the TCM universe seriously for one second. In the end, TCM 4 looked like an amalgamation of 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE' and TWIN PEAKS. The director was obviously influenced by the David Lynch TV series. When you look at the movie in this light, it's not the total disaster that everyone says it is BUT the movie still ends up looking pretty bad because of one major weak aspect about it: it's TOTALLY POINTLESS. If there's was a movie that was totally pointless, it's this one. Why basically remake the first movie a la David Lynch? What's next? The Quentin Tarantino version of TCM?Anyway, personally, I prefer TCM 4 over LEATHERFACE TCM 3, which is just plain bad and is the worst movie of this bizarre so-called series. At least TCM 4 is so consciously bad that, even if it's an almost total embarrassment to the two first films, it's actually fun to watch if you're looking for something to laugh at or with, something that's insanely wacky, full of energy and 100% OVER-THE-TOP! As a straightforward film, TCM 4 rates at a big fat ZERO. But as a \"it's so bad it's good movie,\" TCM 4 rates a perfect 10. It's ranks up there along with GLEN OR GLENDA, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, TERROR IN THE JUNGLE, and THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE as the very best of the worst.",

            "content": "I liked this movie. I liked it in whole and in parts - meaning I enjoyed the film as a whole (and have watched it several times, inflicting it on various friends...), but there were touches in it that really creeped me, and that isn't something that happens every day. The film is your basic teenagers on the way home from the prom get lost and stuck and run into spooky family in the middle of nowhere - mayhem ensues. Actually, this is the movie I thought of (fondly) when I first heard about \"House of 1000 Corpses\". I like this movie much better, and not just because I REALLY want to bring it to a \"Matthew McConaghy Fan Club\" movie night.(SPOILERS)It's the details that make this movie. The wall of drivers' licenses that you can see in the background in one room of the creepy family's house, which implies they've been at this for a while. The filthy bathroom where you can't see the human skin hanging on the back of the door until you're already inside with the door closed.I've always found it hard to imagine a female villain character who actually \"works\" in a movie like this, unless she's either essentially browbeaten and incapable of individual action, or is utterly, irredeemably psychotic. This movie has a creepy female character who both casually flashes passersby from her office window (explaining only that she just got implants and everyone seems to want to see them) and flirts with cops while she has a girl tied up in her trunk. She also gives a variety of weird \"conspiracy theory\"ish explanations for why she goes along with what the spooky family does.Most unusual of all is the weird guy in the limousine who shows up for no particular reason and implies that he put these people here for some reason - presumably to generate exactly the type of urban legends they are generating - and who might be.... Satan? Some underling, anyway. Maybe Ranger Asmodeus (from Equinox) has a cousin. ..The movie left me wondering - in the best possible way. Not the usual \"why did they make this?\" or \"how could they have thought this was good?\" But instead \"who is that guy? Does he have other enclaves of evil out there just waiting for his visits?\" and \"that woman - was she a victim at one point who talked her way into joining them as a survival mechanism, and then convinced herself that it was OK?\" Ya know?",

            "content": "At one point, a terrorized Jenny screams \"I don't understand!\"  And Vilmer replies \"Welcome to the real world.\"  For me, this sums up everything I like about this movie.The TCM series has -- at the best of times -- been about random violence...usually for the sake of sensationalism.  But underneath it all is the creepy realization that not everybody thinks like you do.  Some of them do things which make no sense to you.  When you step into their reality, you're at their mercy, and you'll never understand exactly why.This installment plays the \"why?\" theme to the hilt, eventually copping out somewhat near the end when they should have just left us wondering. Darla is wonderful as Vilmer's girlfriend, alternately getting hung up about seemingly trivial things -- having a quiet dinner for a change -- and goading Vilmer into continuing their twisted, mutually abusive relationship. Vilmer himself has fantastic moments, though none of the actors quite live up to Perensky & Zellweger's standards of convincing nuttiness and terror, respectively.  Though Newmyer is also great in a role which is too small.Outside of the mayhem, there's some wonderful dialogue, especially the first few lines in the movie: the teacher who simpers around the students and then gripes, \"f*** I hate kids.\"  Heather's friend with the absolutely bizarre mannerisms explaining that the gossip-monger is just trying to cause trouble.  Heather saying that they might end up slaughtered and hidden away in somebody's basement, with Sean retorting, \"that's stupid, the houses around here don't have basements.\"  And finally, my favourite line: \"Too bad about her face, Leather, but you can have her shoes!\"Despite all the bad press this movie's received, I hope Kim Henkel enjoys what she created as much as I enjoy watching it.

Writer/director Kim Henkel's totally bonkers style, the chaotic storyline, and gleeful over-acting from almost everyone involved ensures that, although it might not be 'classic' Chainsaw, part four can still be plenty of fun!A pre-fame Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays nerdy teenager Jenny (apparantly, wearing a pair of glasses magically transforms her instantly from hot Hollywood starlet to frumpy geek), one of a group of teenagers who become stranded in the Texas woods after a car crash and fall prey to a clan of cannibals (led by Vilmer, a psycho with a remote-controlled leg, played enthusiastically by rising star Matthew McConaughey).Watching The Next Generation expecting anything remotely resembling logic or narrative cohesion is a completely pointless exercise, 'cos there isn't any; the best approach to take with Henkel's crazy concoction is to just go with the flow\u0097revel in its sheer lunacy, bask in its stupidity, but never question what is happening or why. That way, transvestite Leatherface won't come as such a shock, the Illuminati-style millionaire with belly piercings won't keep you awake at night questioning his relevance, and sudden attacks from airplanes will seem perfectly reasonable.",

            "content": "The third sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is now more famous for starring Matthew McConaughey and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, neither of whom, at the time the film was made, knew better than to accept such trashy roles. The film begins by asking us to care about a group of teens who leave their prom due to a couple having a fight and end up lost in the woods. This mere minutes after having driven away from their high school, which presumably resides in their hometown. Clearly they have not learned their way around much, but no matter. Before too long, they very soon find themselves running for their lives away from the famous freaky family, not only lost in their home town but, before long, also without their car. One of the biggest gripes that people have with this film (which is saying a lot, because there is nothing but stuff to gripe about) is that Leatherface seems to have become a transvestite. You can almost watch the transformation in the film, which seems to me to be sort of the result of trying to make Leatherface too complex. There is a point in the film where the trapped Jenny (Zellweger) tries to get Leatherface to help her escape, talking to him exactly like a psychiatrist would talk to a disturbed child.Come on, we know Leatherface is disturbed; I just don't understand why cross-dressing had to be added to his impressive list of deviations from the pattern of behaviors generally associated with reasonably well-adjusted people. On the other hand, Kim Henkel did co-write the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Tobe Hooper, and has thus been granted at least some right to tamper with the character. What you see in the movie, however, is a lot of tampering gone horribly, horribly wrong. If it ain't broken, as they say, don't fix it. You may end up making it worse.What is amazing to me is how far McConaughey and Zellweger have both come in spite of this film. As I was watching the film, I couldn't believe I was watching the same actor who had turned in such wonderful performances in movies like Bridget Jones' Diary and Cold Mountain, as well as another actor who displayed strong acting presence in movies like EdTV and U-571. Why the focus on Leatherface being a transvestite? Leatherface is a side character anyway, it is Vilmer (McConaughey) who is the star, which is sad because he plays such a belligerent, disgusting character. If you don't believe me that he's more the star than Leatherface, count how many people Leatherface, or anyone else, kills with a chainsaw in the movie (hint: none).Vilmer is the new head of household in the backwoods family, working as a tow-truck driver/reckless murderer and who has the fascinating addition of an electric leg that is operated by remote control. At one point, a high school kid pleads for help, then when he realizes Vilmer's one of the bad guys, he runs away from the truck (running straight down the street rather than into the woods to relative safety, of course), Vilmer gleefully chases him down, laughing and hooting and hollering all the while, and then runs him over five or six times before stashing his body on the back of the truck to later taunt one of his little friends with.As is to be expected, there is never any motive given behind any of the random killings, this is all just the sickening actions of an insane family in the woods, evidently comfortably separate from any sort of law enforcement or even the most tenuous interaction with greater civilization, waiting for unsuspecting teenagers to stumble into their midst. Interesting that the movie starts out as such a gigantic horror movie clich\u00e9, and still manages to go downhill from there.Horror movie sequels are first faced with the usually daunting task of justifying themselves. A horror movie sequel has to have a premise that gives it a reason for having been made, otherwise it is clearly a cash cow made to cash in on the success of the original film. Texas Chainsaw 4, instead, simply passes itself off as something of a remake of the original, rather than another sequel, and turns from the more plodding and slow-moving original to the mindless, completely over-the-top belligerence that you see here. The scenes at the house are peppered with stupid violence, at one point Vilmer throws Darla to the ground and steps on her neck with his powerful leg, nearly killing her by suffocation or by breaking her neck, clearly not caring which. Naturally, she gets up and complains that she could easily leave him and go back to her husband. Charming. Add cannibalism to the mix and you have a hilariously bad movie. Jenny spends much of the latter half of the movie trying to escape from the hungry hungry hicks, as we are constantly bombarded with the stupid, stupid characters and plot twists that the movie makes as it ineptly tries to combine the horror and comedy that even the most mildly competent horror film can display. This is exactly the kind of thing that really makes me wonder why, every time a new movie comes out in a certain series, I always go back and watch the whole series before watching it. I'm still working on The Friday the 13th movies, the Nightmares on Elm Street, and the Child's Play films, which are decidedly more fun than the Texas Chainsaws. And to make matters worse, I have heard nothing but bad things about the 2003 Texas Chainsaw. And given how right all the bad reviews of this movie are, that is certainly a sinking feeling.",

            "content": "This, the fourth in the original series of CHAINSAW films, is without a doubt the oddest yet. Gone is the grinding horror of the original movie, in favour of an out-and-out comedy. It's easy to see why no more sequels were released after this, at least until Michael Bay's franchise 'reboot' \u2013 the formula had been worked into the ground and only repetition could follow. THE NEXT GENERATION is widely regarded as the worst of the series, a total non-event with more horror to be found in a pair of smelly socks, but I think critics are missing the point. This isn't MEANT to be a horror flick \u2013 instead it's a comedy.The threadbare plot is nothing new, a simple sequence of events designed to get some innocent teenagers into the chainsaw household. Once here, the sole surviving female finds herself menaced by a group of mad men (and a woman!). Director Kim Henkel, who wrote and produced the original classic, has plenty of affinity with his material and his focus here is to create new extremes out of old. The film is a chronicle of screeching insanity with every actor encouraged to go way over the top in the call of duty, and I have to admit, I enjoyed the film simply because it's so odd.Of course, it's saddled with cheesy '90s production values and a dearth of characterisation. The teenage 'good guys' are utterly devoid of interest, and the only interesting thing about the main character of Jenny is that the actress portraying her is Renee Zellweger, years before she became really famous in Hollywood. There's no sign of future greatness here, Zellweger is no different from a hundred other teenage scream queens. No, the real interest comes from the complete nutters portraying the 'family'. Leatherface is back, acted by a different actor and this time dressing up as an old woman; he's not menacing at all here, but instead slightly endearing and completely loopy, screaming just as much as Zellweger! The real star of the show, though, is another pre-stardom actor, Matthew McConaughey, playing demented murderer Vilmer. Interesting, McConaughey takes over from ANOTHER pre-stardom actor, Viggo Mortensen, who played virtually the same character in the previous sequel, Leatherface. McConaughey goes above and beyond with a performance of immense energy and physicality and watching him creeping around, complete with bionic leg (!) and harassing people is what makes the film.So there you have THE NEXT GENERATION. It's an overpadded film, full of long, slightly dull chase scenes and an overacting McConaughey literally chewing up the scenery. It may not be art, but I did laugh a lot in comparison to many other so-called Hollywood 'comedies'.",

Kim Henkel decided to make a quasi-sequel to the first film. A very odd but pleasing results make this one a must see for fans. The story revolves around a high school student (Renee Zellweger) and her friends who's traveling the back roads toward their school prom. Along the way their car breaks down and the bump into a very bizarre individual named Vilmer (Matthew Mc Conaughey playing himself) who decides to have fun with his new found friends. One of the clues that are very important to this movie can be found on the side of Vilmer's tow truck. Vilmer also has a hobby that he shares with his dinner companions.I don't know why so many people hate this movie. I found it to be very unique and intelligent. Nothing is spoon fed and the performances are up to snuff. Renee Zellweger and Matthew Mc Conaughy are excellent as the wall flower lead and Vilmer respectfully. When this movie was finally released it was badly edited and it had a virtually non-existent release. It's a shame that people have to slam this movie. I found it quite entertaining.

The plot is almost non-existent and if there is one it's bizarre. It's not even slightly scary and I'm not sure if it even tries to be, it's easily the worst in a genuinely good series. The Leatherface is awfully played, more or less everyone can't act to save their lives, the two leads excluded. There is no actual massacre nor any chainsaw related deaths. So thats all the bad stuff out the way.Now the on the plus side, there is one thing. Matthew McConaughey. The first time I saw it I was stunned by his performance in it. He's really good. Very menacing and maniacal. Also Renee gives a decent performance as the sprightly young heroine.This film does have the power to annoy though. \"Oh my god my torch has run out\" \"I know, You two go and follow the mysterious car....I'll wander about in the woods with what is possibly the worst torch in existence...Oop..It's broke.\"The ending however, is the real cherry on top which makes most people I know hate it. No kind of sense has been made so far but I'm working on it. Where did that plane come from, why did it kill Vilmer, who to him, must've looked like he was also being chased by a man with the chainsaw. So was it all some kind of cult? Why have the police not seen this place? It's not that far from a school let alone civilisation like the original was. Funny how this school where they travel about a mile from is right next to a huge desert too. The list of plot holes could go on....but if you can get past the awful acting, irritating plot, hate-able characters (which is a good thing I guess) and the fact it makes no sense, you might just enjoy yourself. Just watch the two leads and enjoy (kind of).",

And Chainsaw massacre 3.D is just awful. I The Texas chainsaw massacre remake from 2003 is not better then is movie. It is just boring crape. I can't believe people think Texas chainsaw massacre the beginning is better. That movie is producible and boring. In this movie you don't know what is going to happen still you see it. The fist three The Texas chainsaw massacre movies are better but only by a little bite. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects.

            "content": "\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" follows a group of dimwitted Texas teenagers who take a wrong turn on prom night and end up in the hands of Leatherface, his psychotic brothers, and one of their slightly-mad girlfriends. To put it plainly, if there is any film that is going to divide an audience, it's this one, and most people will likely hate it for valid reasons. That being said, I count myself as one of the few admirers of this movie. Perhaps it's because I saw it at an impressionable age, or maybe it's just because I love a good atmospheric horror flick (and this one does have loads of atmosphere). Regardless, I've always found this film to be a lot of fun. It's not scary--it's certainly strange, sometimes even hilarious (both inadvertently and advertently)--but it's never quite boring.Many people have criticized the film over the years for lacking a chainsaw killing, its recreation of the dinner scene with pizza instead of flesh, etc. These people are missing the point. Henkel, whether you respect it or not, was deconstructing the original film here for a gen-x audience. Power up the chainsaw? Leatherface can barely do anything but run around screaming. Cook flesh? They'd rather eat pizza. Terrorize a group of young teenagers? These villains can hardly keep it together--one of them can't even walk without a remote control to power his animatronic leg. And best of all? Their operations are all overseen by a mysterious \"Man in Black.\" Why? Nobody quite knows. Even the family doesn't seem to.I am still not entirely sure what Henkel's point was here, but it's clear he aspired to create a degenerated version of the original film, where its central elements have been twisted into a state of fruitlessness and decay. Perhaps a commentary on the culture, or of horror films at the time--it's hard to say. Regardless, this film is recklessly amusing, unabashedly corny, and never ceases to leave your jaw on the floor for a myriad of reasons. It's of course gone down in history for being the major debut of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, who play the mousey final girl and Leatherface's madcap brother/ringleader, and both are reasonably good here. Even the supporting cast handle the material well enough, and most of the corniness is a result of Henkel's often hammy dialogue. When all is said and done, though, I cannot bring myself to despise this film for all its shortcomings. It's not a \"good\" film per se, but I do see it as something of a failed experiment for Henkel. I have watched this film dozens of times and still have not quite decoded whatever it is he was trying to do here, but I am still endlessly fascinated by the haze surrounding it. It is a pure oddity, and one of the few true ones of its era, for better or for worse.",

Guess what folks, you just ordered the value meal that's been sitting in the warmer just a little too long. The fourth installment of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre sucks... appropriately so.Let me reiterate that this is the third sequel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If anyone is still surprised that it didn't land any Oscars, please please seek help. Personally, for yet another recycled dimestore drive-in flick, I thought this one paid off quite nicely... true, the writing was just this side of atrocious (although I had heard word of an original cut of the film I have had neither the luck to procure one nor the drive to even attempt to), the acting - for the most part - was terrible, but it's still fun to single out the future stars who actually did give performances of startling quality. I must say that I enjoyed the movie for being a regurgitated horror film... I got a few good scares out of it and quite frankly some scenes flat out disturbed me. Sound design was nice, and there were quite a few decent shots here and there, making good (though endless) use of lighting through dust and fog. Editing was nothing superb but oftentimes, the better the cutting, the less we notice it. Altogether, it was a technically aware movie. Not one to expect the unexpected I wasn't disappointed with the film's shortcomings, and when you try to dissect the plot there are some pretty substantial ones. Still, a fine delivery, particularly after the style-sterile attempt of the third film.\nNot the greatest film ever, but far from being the worst.",

I really thought the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was really cheesy, and it really didn't entertain me. I know what your gonna say, this movie was very entertaining, scary, and was anything but cheesy back in 1974, but it isn't 1974! To me a remake is just updating the film, but keeping it at it's original levels, in which most cases in remaking films, they just completely change the story and switch things back and forth, until youv'e got a whole different movie. This movie pretty much stuck to it's basic lines of the original film. Now with the acting in this film, it wasn't all too bad, although I've seen WAY better from Renee Zellweger. Matthew McConaughey's acting is always usually pretty good, so his acting level was the same. I also think a good thing about the movie is that the producer of the original film (Kim Henkel) directed this remake. I think that's good because she helped make the original, and should have the experience of dealing with this kind of movie. So, what I guess I'm trying to say here is that I really did enjoy this movie.

Its the usual story of high school prom night turned bad as the typical airhead girlfriend, moron boyfriend and likable nerdy girl (Renee Zellweger) fall victim to a rural Texas dysfunctional family led by madman (Mathew McConaughey). If you've seen the previous \"Chainsaw\" films, then you should know what to expect, but this comes off so eccentric, that its impossible to take seriously. Mathew McConaughey tries way too hard to be insane as the maniacal Vilmer, and Renee Zellweger tries way to hard to be scared as the female lead. The rest of the characters are either mindless fodder or laughable afterthoughts such as Tyler Cone as Barry who's every line in the film is a literary quote, and Leatherface in drag and constantly screaming in dress and makeup is just way too wacky. McConaughey's character's leg is controlled by a remote actuator, and he slaps and cuts himself repeatedly while abusing everyone around him, especially Zellweger. Somehow a powerful organization is behind the control and funding of the torture tactics implemented by Vilmer and his clan, a strange plot device that completely throws the film into left field. Its a masochistic freak show, and little gore, hardly any chainsaw action, and plenty of silly inconsistencies (at one point a chainsaw cuts bricks off a chimney with no effort???) make this effort a real blunder. Its entertaining for its ineptness and craziness if anything.",

But there's more to it than that. Yes the film falls into the so bad it's good category with some truly ridiculous performances and dialogue outside of the two leads. But There is a raw primal intensity that rules the film making the overly comical feel like true horror especially with the insane twist. Now I'm not saying it's believable by any means but theres a twisted theology that resonates through the proceedings. Written and directed by Kim Henkel of the original film it definitely has a weird retro feel to it all. Both Zellweger and the sexy and twisted McConaughey come out on top of the film. Both of their performances are solid and definitely leave the promise of their future cinematic endeavors and Oscar wins. All in all there's nothing like it. It's flawed and nowhere near perfect but its original and wild.

There's also the ones that can do both at the same time (Nightmare on Elm Street). This is one of the funny ones and before you start critiquing it, you have to realize that. With that statement in mind, this movie is great. Vilmer's remote controlled leg is probably the funniest of all. Many laughs are produced off of that one. And then there's strange old Leatherface. When the victims and that cuckoo torturous family get together, you are talking pure enjoyment that has got to be fun for whole family 15 and above.

Running time: 86 minutes. Rated R (for bizarre violent and sexual content, and for strong language).By Blake French:\t\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" is so bad it is virtually mind numbing. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Even the most horrible of bad movies tower far above this romp that wonders between insipid concepts and horror free events. I have a real hard time excepting the fact that such badness can actually qualify as a mainstream film production. This picture is disturbing, bizarre, and god awful. I wish I could provide you with a more thought out opening paragraph, but what else can I say?There is absolutely zero character development in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation.\" Due to this, we really couldn't care less about what happens to the main characters. The film's logic free story consists of several high school students becoming lost in the depth of a wooded area where they stumble upon a sickening family of psychopaths that put new meaning to the word dysfunctional. \tThere are two deaths in the film, both of side characters. One is run over with a truck. The other has his neck broken. In a movie titled \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation,\" one would expect gory murders a plenty--though that is far from reality in this case. There is no blood, no guts, and no chainsaw killings. The Leatherface character does absolutely nothing in the film. Excuse me. He does do something. He dresses up like a woman and shrieks his chainsaw above his head while screaming wildly.\n\tWho are the villains? What do they want? What conceivable reasons do they have for living the lifestyle they inhabit? There are no answers provided. I am not necessarily stating that the majority of viewers will even care enough about the plot to even ask any questions. I am just backing up my theory of the terrible qualities this production contains.\tIt is quite the surprise to witness some big names in the film's cast list, such as Renee Zellweger and  Matthew McConaughey. Neither of the two are capable of rescuing the movie, nor are they able to perform with fine dramatic tension. What a complete waste of talent director and writer Kim Henkel constructs with this piece of trash.\tAfter screening \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I love movies so much, but this so-called movie is a disgrace to all film's associated with. It is so hard to understand what the individual's intentions were when they produced this heap of garbage. Did the filmmakers desire to give movies a bad name? Or did they actually believe \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" was worth a penny? After seeing this movie's poster, and seeing the tagline \"Still Buzzing After All These Years,\" I had a question for it. Why is the series still buzzing when it ran out of fuel long before this film was made?",

Sylvester Stallone made porn as well as \"Death Race 2000\" before making it big with \"Rocky\". George Clooney made \"Grizzly II: The Concert\". Johnny Depp starred in \"A Nightmare on Elmstreet\". And, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey both starred in \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"...a film that is currently #45 on the IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 worst rated major release movies of all time.In this film, the normally cute and very pretty Zellweger plays a ridiculous nerd. How do you know she's a nerd? She never washes her hair and wears dorky glasses. Why she would hang out on prom night with the vacuous and nasty 'popular couple' makes little sense....and everyone seemed more like caricatures than real people. Plus, anyone...even a super-dork...would wash their hair when going to prom. As for McConaughey, he plays a redneck serial killer...and actually is much more believable than the rest. Little do any of them know that far worse awaits them.So is the film any good despite being on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List? No. Many of the characters make no sense (such as the lady who flashes her breasts out the window and whose dialog was written by a groundhog) and the film seems like it was made for folks who find the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise too intellectually taxing. Bad acting, bad direction, ultra-violence and a script that simply is an excuse to see teens butchered...this one is simply a bad film from start to finish.

Certainly, it represented an original point-of-view that is rare enough for these types of movies.Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zelwegger give charismatic performances, which makes their later stardom understandable.As for the dumb dialogue and over-the-top performances, it was obviously intended to be campy, and, in many instances was funny and effective. Even the incredibly ditzy, wooden, female victim was obviously directed to perform in that manner. I highly doubt it was just a case of merely bad acting. To the movie's credit, though it is brutal (and somewhat misogynistic) in spots, there is an absence of true gore. When a man gets repeatedly run over by a vehicle, or another character gets their head crushed underfoot, the actual gore is kept off the screen. This makes the deaths seem more horrific.  I was not enamored with the idea of Leatherface as being transgendered. That's been overdone in similar films and is rather unnecessary. In fact, one tends to feel sorry for Leatherface, more than anything else.\nThe film was atmospheric, though not especially scary. It reminded me of a live-action cartoon. Similar in style to the \"Tales From The Crypt\" series.My main gripe, and the reason for just giving it a 6 (out of 10) was for some of the brutal sadism. For example, one of the characters is repeatedly poked and stunned with a cattle prod. It happens over and over again until you just want to scream at the director \"Enough.\" A little too much relish went into terrorizing the females in the movie (not the men).

PERFECT that you wonder if he really is a bit nutty in real life. The things he says cracks me up. When he runs over the character Sean with his tow truck saying \"Yep, that shoulda done' it... that shoulda done it riiiight there.\" I just laugh so incredibly hard at how crazy he is throughout the entire movie. You have to let go of your cirtical, Siskel & Ebert serious side & just have some fun with this movie! The Next Generation isn't much for blood and guts like the original, it more so focuses on demented psychopaths who live amongst body parts and filth and who torture for fun. They try to give you the meaning of \"HORROR\" even that crazy-skin-flesh-nipple-ring guy admits that the whole \"psycho killer\" set-up is, & I quote: \"appalling\" as far as horror goes. So there, they admit it but the characters are still great in my opinion. But the scene with the prom kids in Darla's office is a load of laughs because Tonie Perensky portrays the hot psycho chick to a \"T\". She's completely cool and collected about her lifestyle and just pulls off the greatest pin-up type homicidal bimbo character ever. And she manages to still look hot despite almost getting choked to death (by a TV remote controlled leg) and smacked around a few times by Vilmer. Renee is EXCELLENT as the virginal victim who, unlike most innocent horror movie victims who do the stereotypical \"running up the stairs when they should be running out of the front door,\" Renee gets some courage to climb a 3 story roof, swing from a cable line, jump out of a window, & is even brave enough to point in Leather's face and tell him to \"SIT THE F*CK DOWN!\" GO JENNY! Jenny's friend Heather is a little annoying with her little girl voice and airhead paranoia but she acknowledges the error of her ways and ultimately gets the grossest punishments. So we can pardon her! The only one I can say that really didn't impress me was Leather himself. This if the first Texas CM movie I've seen where Leather runs around pulling at his hair and screaming endlessly like a little girl instead of getting down to some real deal chainsaw business. After a few minutes of them introducing Leather (continuously screaming like a sissy) you're looking for the MUTE button on your remote. This movie doesn't lose the original concept of the Ed Gein theme by showing briefly the woman-skin suit hanging behind a bathroom door, however in this TCM movie we get to see Leather decked out for dinner in a fancy gown, red lipstick and a black wig he must have stolen from Tina Turner.All in all, I really find this movie entertaining and think that Matthew and Renee got off to a GREAT start with these characters. I give it 1\u00bd thumbs up! =]",

Yeah, that's horror at it's best.

The movie is about madness, plain old madness, and thats what it delivers. Again, it borrows heavily on the original. A bit tacky to say the least, but its got a lot of its own to stand on. I found that the character of Vilmer to be the best \"not Leatherface\" psycho of the series. Just edging out Bill Moseley as Chop-Top. Its popcorn horror, plain and simple. This movie scratches that part of me that also enjoys Cannibal Holocaust and Toxic Avenger. I recommend giving it a shot. You might hate it, or then again it might become one of your favorites.",

Those that are unfamiliar with R.A.W.'s books can only guess @ where the \"Scarified, multiply pierced dude with the bad hair cut\" could possibly fit in.  The fact is, he doesn't, despite Darla's best efforts to lay some kind of ground work.  I don't even know if Toby could have done for this what he did for Poltergeist.  @ the same time, The concept of plot is a hang-up to the off the hook action TCM demands - cause and effect - time and distance - right and wrong - need to go right out the window if your going to make it work.  Rothman walks in and they all freeze-up like some bad stage play.  Say what you want to about Bob Altman but he keeps everything going all over the place and picks out bits here and there to create something massive.  But the action never stops.One last thing: the multiple off screen crushings were great, but the snapping of the neck on screen cheapened it.  If Vilmer had been arguing with Barry and working the kids neck over and then the camera had zoomed on his exprssion and all's we'd have heard was snapping \u0085 that would have been an oH WoW \u0085 right up there with Orville already being awake when Alan walks in in \"Children shouldn't play with dead things.\"",

            "content": "I was fairly late to the \"Chainsaw Massacre\" movies, being only 20 years old. I remember one day walking in to Wal-Mart and finding this movie for $3 on VHS and I was intrigued: I wasn't alive to experience the \"shocking\" first film, and I barely remembered the second film from when I was a child, so I figured I might as well take a chance and purchase this. This was from years ago -- before I discovered ultra-gory movies, before I really had much knowledge of horror movies in general, and... wow. Then and now, this movie holds up.The biggest thing about this film is that people seem to suggest that it doesn't live up to the legacy of the Chainsaw series. Having watched all the films in the series now, I can say that this is EASILY the best of the lot. The most entertaining, the most hilarious, and the most memorable. Sure, it doesn't \"shock\" and \"awe\" like the other (overrated) entries supposedly do, but it does have its merits: Matthew McCoughnahay is just hilarious in his role as truck driver with a robot leg. \"First I'm gonna kill ya... it ain't no f***ing biggy.\" You'll be quoting him for weeks.Renee Zellwegger, in her best role ever, actually looks pretty good as an abused daughter and proceeds to run away from Leatherface barefooted, sees all her friends get killed, and gets her face licked by some businessman with weird tattoos and piercings on his chest.There seems to be no point to this entire film. I guess Leatherface killed JFK. And is a transvestite now. And is somehow affiliated with the government, and people need to learn the true meaning of \"horror. Horror.\" And what's with the ending? The man and the woman in the trailer have a different person dubbing their voices for them? Why? And what about the airplane flying around and then suddenly hitting a character in the head and oil comes out of their brain? What? ... I'm not going to say that this is a serious film by any means, but it is definitely the most memorable. Ten out of ten.",

This movie is tolerable, the characters aren't the greatest in the world, but they fit into the plot. Matthew McCaunaghey(pardon the spelling, I cant remember how to spell it) is definitely the best actor in this film. He portrays the character of \"Vilmer\" quite well. I didn't like Heather or Barry that much, Barry was only cool in the part where he locks W.E out of his house and says \"HAHA Dumbass\" and stuff. Heather is just a screaming bitch who should have died first. Sean wasn't bad, but he wasn't in the movie too long so you couldn't judge him really. My personal favorite part was the car accident scene, where the cars collide and the guy (named 'I'm Not Hurt' in the credits) gets out all shaky and says \"I'm not hurt! I'm not hurt!\" before passing out. Over all this movie is definitely not the best, but it is tolerable. Fans of the other 3 movies should definitely see this one. In my opinion, Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre beats the 2003 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre by far.OK movie, 5/10",

            "content": "Written and directed by Kim Henkel, who wrote the original film, this take on the Sawyer family has sadly been forgotten, but it had - as so many films do - a rocky creation, a two year period where it disappeared and features two big stars who pretty much don't want anything to do with it. It's also the last movie in the original timeline of the films before remake and reboot and reimagining became the constant status quo for chainsaw movies.I can see why some people dislike this movie. After all, there's now a thousand-year-old secret society paying off the Sawyers - who now choose pizza over human flesh - to kill people to keep the population in a constant state of fear. Or maybe they do it so people can achieve transcendence through that terror. Leatherface, who used to be a killing machine, now struggles with not only his ability to capture and murder the teengers, but his sexuality, cross-dressing and screaming like a child.He also does not use a chainsaw.The real center of this story is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's Jenny, who Henkel wrote the story around, claiming that was about \"her transformation, her refusal to shut up, to be silenced, to be victimized. And by extension her refusal to be oppressed.\" In the director's cut, it's shown that she's been abused her whole life, so the terror of the Sawyers leaves her unafraid.Actually, they're now the Slaughters, not the Sawyers, and led by the other big star in this production - he wasn't at the time - Matthew McConaughey as Vilmer Slaughter, a maniac who combines the characteristics of the HItchhiker, Chop Top and Leatherface with a cybernetic leg and the need to self-scar himself. His wife Darla reveals much of the conspiracy theory in the film, except that she also claims that she has a bomb implanted in her skull and that Vilmer is from space.This movie played 27 theaters, then Japan and then disappeared for two years, as CAA wanted nothing to ruin the success of McConaughey. It finally played in twenty cities in 1997. Yet it has its fans, as no less a Chainsaw fan as Joe Bob Briggs said, \"This is the best horror film of the 90s\" and called this \"a flick so terrifying and brilliant that it makes the other two Chainsaw sequels seem like \"After-School Specials.\"The end of the film features John Dugan, Grandfather from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Paul A. Partain, who was Franklin and Marilyn Burns, who was Sally. I love that she locks eyes with Kenny as the movie closes. I also adore that this movie has so many Texas bands, like \"Der Einziger Weg\" by Debbie Harry and Robert Jacks (who was Leather in this), plus songs by Roky Erickson and Daniel Johnston.",

However, in reality, I found myself to like the film in all its warped oddness, clumsy editing, confused storyline, and mediocre to bad acting. The four teens, Jenny, Heather, Barry and Sean, were all extremely annoying, so it's not like you're really rooting for them to get out alive or anything. I myself thought Heather would have been a better leading girl than Jenny - Renee Zellweger's character almost seemed to like getting chased around by Leatherface and tortured and whatnot by the other demented family members. The best actor in this movie overall would have to be Matthew McConaughey. He was excellent as the psychotic Vilmer and seemed to take over for Leatherface, who in this entry is not scary at all and spends a lot of time screaming like a woman and putting on makeup and whatnot. Matthew's role is indeed the highlight of this confused, low-budget mess. I found myself insanely turned on by his sexy, rugged presence as the movie progressed - call me sick, but hey, Renee Zellweger seemed to want some of that when he kept going after her. Other points to mention include the strange subplot involving the FBI (I'm still trying to figure that out, I just don't get it) and also how it seems that this film was originally conceived as a remake but once it got to video they are marketing it as this all new entry in the \"Chain Saw\" series. Not so. It adds nothing new. It's just a rehash of the original '74 classic, which is, of course, the best out of all the \"Chain Saw\" movies. If you like trashy type, low budget movies, you will like this. Keep in mind, it's not really bloody at all and no one is killed with a chainsaw.

She and her friends fall prey to the secret cannibals and murderous tow truck driver Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey).This is a few months after Dazed and Confused. Both Zellweger and McConaughey would go from that indie darling to this forgotten horror comedy and eventually onwards to becoming Academy Awards winning stars. It's amazing to see the two Texans doing an iconic Texas horror franchise. Strict franchise fanatics would hate this Leatherface. There's no way any cinema snobs would like this. At the time, these future stars were nobodies. I can understand its dismissal at the time of its release. I myself am watching it for the first time.

I preferred the trailer park babe who was constantly making references to her fake breasts. She was funny.  The movie did go downhill with the arrival of the freak in the limo.  It became very disjointed.  So did all of the others, though.  All TCM movies have always been about one subject...mindless violence and shock value.If you didn't like it...fine.  I was disappointed that the two main characters are embarrassed about making the movie.  It's not something to be proud of, no.  But it is still a piece of film that they got paid for. Also a break that they were given, as unknown actors. Just goes to show that once actors make it to the top, they forget the mere humans at the bottom, that boosted them up.",

Lisa Marie Newmeyer puts in a memorable role as the mindless Prom queen and has some of the funniest lines since \"Clueless\" and Renee Zellweger is great as the mousey Jenny who goes from classroom geek to feisty survivor and gives the cannibal clan a good run for their money. It's all very purposely retro, a film that would have been top notch in the 70's slasher era...when the characters sprout lines like..\"My flashlight's dead\" or \"Hello? Is someone there\", walk into old houses in the middle of the woods and split up to get help, you know that the director Kim Henkel wanted to capture the innocent horror of pre \"Scream\" times. It's a pity that he got lost somewhere after the first hour and added the senseless Rothman character...instead of staying classic and ending with a great chase scene he tried to make the story a little bit different. He should have stuck with the formula we've trusted for so long and one he'd delivered so far...still not a bad sequel...better than 2, much better!!!",

            "content": "This is the second best of the series. This one is about a girl named Heather catches her boyfriend Barry kissing another girl. Heather gets mad and takes off in a car, Barry also jumped in, and in the back seat is Jenny and Sean. The four teens get into an accident hurting the guy in the other car. Sean stays with the hurt guy, and Jenny, Heather, and Barry go to find help. They find a woman named Darla. Darla calls a man named Vilmer to \"help\" the guy who is hurt and toll the car and them back into town. Vilmer comes to Sean and the hurt guy and kills them both. Jenny, Heather, and Barry find a truck that can drop them off at the prom again but it doesnt stop. Heather and Barry run off and follow it and leave Jenny alone, Jenny finds Vilmer. Heather and Barry find a house, Barry goes out back to find someone, Heather waits on the porch, then Heather is attacked by Leatherface and put on the hook for now. Barry is killed by Leatherface. Jenny finds out that Vilmer killed Sean and the hurt guy. Jenny runs out of his truck and into the woods, and meets Leatherface ... This is the second best of the series. People say all the actors are bad. But Renee Zellweger (Jenny), Matthew McConaughey (Vilmer), Robert Jacks (Leatherface), Tonie Perensky (Darla), and there are more. So if you are a true Texas Chain Saw Massacre fan see this movie!!",

Perhaps we were all a bit TO harsh on this awful movie.I'm a Texas chainsaw freak (especially hoopers' 74 version) so i think it gives me the right to talk about it.FIRST the bad things..The character 'Heather' is kind of dumb and annoying how she plays the role and also the 'Barry' character BUT ..sometimes it's fun to watch these people act,or try to act.and trust me,there are much much worse actors and actresses in the world.and not only in ass and tit movies. and i think that's about it that bothered me. Don't see it as a true horror movie.See it as a comedy or black comedy.Cause sometimes 'Vilmer'(McConaughy) reminds me of a Patrick Bateman or something.He plays it pretty darn good.The quotes are cool and Zellweger i never liked actually in any movie except this one. maybe i liked it because my friend and myself were finished watching John Woo's The killer and than this movie was very late on Television.It was perfect.we had a good time,good laugh,and both liked the Vilmer character,the rest as well. So man,the score here is 2.6/10 which is ridiculous.There are movies like 'the worm eaters','XXX'(with Vin Diesel),'Psycho'(the remake!) and other shitty comedies nowadays that are MUCH worse in my honest opinion. So really,give it a chance,it's not THAT bad.. for fans of:American Psycho,Killing Zoe(not for the action scenes),some old Wes Craven films,nothing really Italian horror-like to be found here.. and another thing..I think Mr.Hooper didn't really cared for this movie cause it doesn't really need to be compared with the first one,but people still do.so see this one with an open mind and don't care about what's been made in the past.Hooper(in my opinion) bothered with the real 'good' remakes from the Texas chainsaw with Jessica Biel and the prequel movie sort of speak.cause that wasn't necessary cause the first one already WAS a true success.They were good but personally i didn't cared for them that much. This movie is different.It's not my all time favorite horror movie,not by a long shot BUT i think there's plenty of entertainment to be found here. Enjoy people and sorry about the spelling(from Belgium you see)My Rate:6/10",

My favorite character in the film has to be Darla for those of you that don't know who she is or remember she is Vilmer's girlfriend. I've read many reader reviews for this film & i don't understand why everyone has nothing but bad stuff to say about it. For fan's of the WWF this is a film you should see because WWF Diva Debra Williams-Wife of Stone Cold Steve Austin has a bit role a Police Officer 1... This film very much so has the feel of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is a classic all it's own. 4 friends start out at the Prom where Heather catches her boyfriend Berry with another girl she runs off Barry follows she jumps in his Dad's car as Barry soon does... she puts the petal to the medal then Jenny & her friend Sean sit up from the back seat & a lot of talk goes on. So on Heather takes a short cut down a dirt back road much like other TCM's Heather ends running into another car causing the car to go off the road, after this they all get out of the car and check on the other  uy whoam they hit...he faints! So 3 of the 4 go to look for help leaving Sean to stay with the other guy. Heather, Barry & Jenny find help when they come upon Darla's work place. She call's her boyfriend Vilmer to go out and get the car...The kid's thank Darla for her help and go off on their way back to the car along the way they get lost & Heather & Barry go down a path they see leaving Jenny alone on the road alone...Now back to Sean who is still waiting with the car, Vilmer comes along in his toll truck & comes out and checks on the guy who had fainted Vilmer then goes on to tell Sean that he is dead & then kills him...Vilmer goes on to kill Sean, Heather... Leatherface kill's Barry coming out of the bathroom... Jenny makes it through the film... now i cut that short so you that have not seen it will get a shock from the rest of the film. Anyway this film gets a 10 out 10 from me.",

Okay, so it's not the greatest movie of all time, but I hardly think the writers/director/producer or even the actors set out with the idea of making another \"Citizen Kane\" in mind. It's another cheesy horror movie sequel like so many before it and like so many that are to come.I like the original movie. It's not the greatest horror movie in my opinion but it's entertaining enough. Okay, so there are some overlaps with the original in this movie. Isn't that a good thing? It is, after all, a sequel. Yes, there are some events that don't make sense. For example, after Heather is hung from the meat hook she's then found crawling on the road without a big hole in back. But, hey, most movies have some problem with continuity. And, I disagree with the people who said that the acting was awful. I thought that Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellwegere did a pretty good job. I certainly can see why they became stars. I mean, Matthew McConaughey was pretty convincing as a psychopathic killer.It is a shame that Leatherface has been reduced to a drag queen-esquire character and that, while he does chase people with a chain saw, he doesn't actually kill anyone with it. Obviously, for people expecting this movie to be like the original TCM, it's not. But, get a grip people! It's not the worst movie ever made. Have you ever seen \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" I found the movie entertaining and if it was on again I would probably watch it again. If you're into campy stuff, then this movie is for you.",

            "content": "After first seeing this movie, my actions were warped toward the nonsensical for days. I have since seen it five or six times, and personally, consider it a fantastic film. It is primarily a spoof on the slasher movie formula, with a very esoteric twist added on. It follows a group of high-schoolers on their prom night, who, in the heat of an argument, take off in a car, and mysteriously become lost within minutes. Soon enough, they encounter Velmer, armed in his Illuminati Wrecking truck,(which should, for perceptive viewers,[which obviously does not include the impatient idiots who have reviewed this movie on this same board] illustrate some of the wierd events to come) whose job it is to cause these teenagers to experience absolute terror, with the hopes (of his Illuminati boss, who possesses archemedean-spiraled stomach nipples)that they will have spiritual experiences (or at least, that those who survive will!). Velmer does this with the help of his family, which includes his cocky but controlled girlfriend, his older brother, now emasculated (the former Leatherface), and someone whose relation to Velmer I can't figure out, as whose name, I'm pretty sure, is Dubayee (personally, I think that Dubayee is my favorite character). Expect events to transpire which will leave you wondering for weeks if not months, and, for earnest viewers, a serious search including multiple viewings, trying to ascertain just what this movie is trying to say. Good luck, happy viewing, and congradulations on refraining from quickly passing this, or any, movie off before you make a careful analysis of it (which, again, the aforementioned previous reviewers have failed to be).

Originally made as a bad sequel, now thought of as a bad comedy, this 4th entry in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the worst films of all time. It's one of the few movies that has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The acting is just awful! Young Renee Zellwegger and Matthew McConaughey star in this in some of their earliest roles. The direction....what direction? Leatherface chases people around like he's blind. He misses people right in front of him. Also noted, this was written and directed by a woman, so they have Leatherface dressed like in drag through most of the film, which is just ridiculous. The writing makes no sense and consists of nonstop cussing and yelling and grunting.As for the plot, heck, like the direction there is none. These 4 kids get lost from their prom and end up getting attacked by a crazed family led by Vilmer (McConaughey). First off, why would these stupid kids get lost from prom? Do they not know where their houses are from the school? The characters are so dumb and unlikeable that you'll be rooting for the family to kill them. Unfortunately, there is no gore at all, and that is not an exaggeration. There is not one drip of blood on the screen. The climax of the film involves a helicopter that manages to hit one person but misses someone else 3 feet in front of them. The very end is not explained at all and will have everyone scratching their heads. Plus Leatherface has no point. They shouldn't have made this a sequel considering Leatherface has absolutely nothing to do and is mostly just sitting down.This movie will leave a sour taste in anyones mouth.

Maybe he had abusive parents, maybe he's never had the opportunity to be educated and he is jealous of the kids, we may never know. There are moments when he is physically quite rough with the women in this film. Surprisingly there isn't actually much gore for a movie about a massacre. There is however a lot of abuse.

Leatherface(under disguise is Robert Jacks this time around)is mostly dressed under female skin, wigs, and dresses(!) swinging his chainsaw like a madman never knowing what it might take out whether it be a limb or door. Tonie Perensky as Matthew McConaughey's squeeze Darla is as nutty as the rest of the clan, although she looks relatively normal on the surface. Sadly she's really Zellweger's only ally. You have Joe Stevens as WE, who is always quoting something someone else has put to paper, whether it be Shakespeare or Emerson, even though the saying might have nothing at all to do with the event in front of him. Poor hottie Lisa Marie Newmyer as prom queen Heather gets thrown in a freezer containing dead skin, hung on a meat hook, doused and set on fire, & her skull crushed. What's even more sick is whose ACTUALLY behind all these psychopaths..some man of wealth who believes that what horrors he offers the unfortunate victims is means for a more spiritual experience! McConaughey drives his tow truck over one poor soul numerous times for fun, Leatherface slams a sledgehammer over one's head(at least it stopped there for him), and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger actually scales the sick clan's house with Leatherface slicing bricks from their chimney with his chainsaw at her! There's a moment in the film where Joe enjoys sticking Zellweger with a cattle-prod. And, to cap off the madness, not only does McConaughey like to cut himself with a knife when angered, he also has this robotic leg that goes haywire if somebody has this specific remote control.",

Soon enough Matthew McCaughney shows up snapping necks, overkilling a guy with his monster truck, and jumping off roofs onto cars. He seems to be in charge of the new \"Sawyer family\". Leatherface spends half the film in drag and screaming his lungs out during chaotic scenes of violence or chases. The teen characters are so stupid you actually root for them to meet their demise. The acting is all over the place. Matthew McCaughney gives a whacked out, over the top performance, while Renee Zellwegger is mediocre at best.There's some ridiculous sub-plot about the Sawyer family being used as a type of anarchy/psycho squad by some sort of agency or occult. But it falls flat and seems like trying to add some method to the madness.The gore is weak, the acting is weak but the film has a manic pace and some truly disturbing moments. It does feel like a rehash of the original and part 3. But thats expected when your plot revolves around a redneck, cannibalistic family with a chainsaw wielding maniac.

Nothing in this film works, absolutely NOTHING. I'm not exaggerating when i'm saying watching paint dry would be a more enjoyable and entertaining experience than watching a second of this movie ever again. Besides the horrendous acting and cheap set pieces, this film somehow manages to be the longest 85 minutes of my life. Its chase scenes go on for what feels like hours, and I am just left there puzzling in my chair how something like this ever even made it to the editing room- let alone see this fit as a final outgoing product. Besides its tedious and poorly edited nature- the film's acting is also absolutely horrendous- even from the likes of future Hollywood stars Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger. I have to give MCConaughey some props, he seems to be the only person trying in this film, but man does it just not work, and his overacted violent redneck character feels as half baked as it was the last 3 times around. In the end, TCM The Next Generation does nothing new or notable for its long running franchise, in fact, it only tarnishes its reputation further.

            "content": "What the hell was going on when the writers penned this mess and the director filmed it? They must have either been drunk or stoned. In fact, that may be the state required to enjoy this travesty.Okay, so the story isn't that bad - it's just your usual regurgitated 90's horror tale. A group of teens go to prom. Though on their way home they get lost and end up being in an accident. Three of the four decide to go and find help while the remaining teen stays behind with the injured driver of the other car. What could go wrong? Well, they do try to get help from the Slaughter family...It's here that things start to fall apart and everything collapses in on itself. The worst thing with the story are the characters. These range from believable to the truly ridiculous. All the teenagers are truthfully represented. Even Darla Slaughter is a reasonable character... up to a point. I even like the strange relationship she has with Vilmer. However, Vilmer is the most terrible and implausible character I've ever seen. Then you have W E Slaughter who likes to recite quotes; though you have to wonder where these references come from as you never see him reading - though it is a good hook. As for good old Leatherface, you're not afraid of him. You may feel sorry for him as he's bullied by everybody else in the family and is usually running around in fright... having this family I'd be sprinting about too.Speaking of running, Rene Zellweger should have tried out for the Olympics. This beautiful lady can run like she's got wings on her feet. It's worth watching the film for... almost.The performers do great jobs with their characters. Zellweger is the strongest in the cast. This is because she has the broadest personality and range of actions. She's a shy girl who has to come out of her shell and get ultra-tough so she can survive the night. Matthew McConaughey is insane... he is so over the top as Vilmer that scenes with him in are nearly unwatchable. Not only do you need to keep your finger over the volume button for his temper tantrums but also Leatherface's screams. Robert Jacks who portrays him can hit notes that can shatter eyeballs. All this does is add to the unwatchability of the movie.Halfway through your wondering what's happening. By the conclusion, that question is still there but you'll have added, why did I just watch this? This is the second time I've watched this rubbish and I have to say I still cannot answer those concerns.Though I will admit there is one scene I love, not because it's good though. Vilmer is having a rant in the kitchen and Darla starts to argue with her so he throws her headfirst into the fridge door. He kicks her a couple of times and then stands on her windpipe. This is a really violent segment and looks nasty. But then you get a distance shot and though Darla is fighting to breathe she still has time to straighten her skirt so you cannot see her panties. This is a woman who regularly flashes her boobs at passing teenage boys as they buzz her place of work. It unintentionally made me smile as I thought of all the wrestling matches where they did the same sort of thing...Anyway, I've given this bad piece of filmmaking too many words and too much time. Only thing I have left to say is... If this hasn't warned you off the movie let me put it in more concise form - Do Not Watch This Film.It's just not a good waste of your time.Feel free to come on over and check my lists for other possible viewing pleasures and you can see where this flick landed in my Killer Thriller Chillers list come chart.",

            "content": "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" is far better than it's reputation has given it.**SPOILERS**After a disastrous night at their prom, students Jenny, (Renee Zellweger) Sean, (John Harrison) Barry, (Tyler Cone) and Heather, (Lisa Marie Newmeyer) get stranded on a dirt road and ask local Darla, (Tonie Perensky) for help. Making their way through the woods back to wait for Vilmer, (Matthew McConaughey) they wind up lost in the surrounding woods. When they're taken back to their house, they are eventually captured by Leatherface, (Robert Jacks) and W.E., (Joe Stevens) and the rest of their family. Gathering up her strength and courage, the dwindling group is forced to fight off the family before they are all killed.The Good News: There is an incredible amount to like here. Perhaps one of the best features is that it's a loving tribute to the original but changes them around enough to really get a sense of it being something new. The opening twist is pretty nice, changing the funeral trip to a prom night disaster, which is pretty nice. The chainsaw chase is still the highlight here, and while not being as intense as before, it's still a real spectacular action set-piece, taking a generally similar approach while altering events to a degree to be a winking nod to the ones before while also being new in it's own right. The dinner table sequence makes a nice come-back, and is, if not as psychologically disturbing, just as edgy and confronting. It's still a must-see experience in the film. Also quite impressive is the sequence where the victims are dragged to the kitchen to be stored away for later. It's an incredibly long, drawn-out sequence that is as disturbing as it gets, and it should rightfully be so in that situation. It's played for what it should've been, a really intense unflinching experience and it's all the better for it for having done so in that fashion. The film is incredibly suspenseful, and this is nowhere more apparent than in the opening stages. The forest setting given to the action is enormously menacing, almost from the start. The very low light, the constant fog that drapes the ground, and the fact that they just pop up in there out of nowhere really warps the mind. The sequence where they encounter a truck driving down the road and chase off into the darkness after it while only one stays on the normal path is full of tension and dread. Along the chase, this was the real highlight scene, and a strong contender is the opening murder. Having the victim chased down the road by a huge monster truck with blaring lights shining up the location and what eventually happens is quite a breathtaking action scene that really sticks out in the movie. Even more impressive is the gang-banger pace to the film. It rushes along from one even to another in a heartbeat, with the eventual capture around the fifty minute mark, allowing for plenty of time to be tortured in the house, and that also leaves the beginning to be a completely whirlwind experience. Add these together, and this has the makings of an underrated gem.The Bad News: While it's a true hidden gem, there are a couple of nagging problems in this one. The most obvious one is that Leatherface has been severely diminished in status for the film. He's barely in the film at all, and when he is on-screen, he's really ineffective. The sequence of him taking the two friends out to be killed is twice as long as it should've been, as they keep escaping and getting recaptured. The mask itself is a real disappointment from the clever and original one in the previous film, and the sad fact that he had to wear a mask and outfit that made it seem like he was a drag queen isn't all that frightening. As is common practice for the series, there's really no body count here, and this in turn really reduces the gore in here. It's got some suspenseful scenes to help out, but the lack of gore on display is really frightening. The new family doesn't do much to help out, and at times they're not at all that edge to them that previous ones had. As such, the fact that it also changes some of the original's magic is a big misstep, and depending on how far an individual's perspective of that is, it's quite damaging to the original. The ending is also pretty hard to figure out and really doesn't do much to help with the explanations of anything. These work against it, but it's nowhere near as bad as it could've been.The Final Verdict: A fun, if unoriginal romp through familiar territory, this is a really wrongly maligned film that deserves to be viewed objectively. It's not the best film in the genre, and it really wasn't pretending to be. If you can view films in that manner, give it a shot, but steer clear if that doesn't sound like you.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity",

Kim Henkel, the director, was the co-writer of the original chainsaw massacre back in 1974 and it is apparent this is his version of how he saw the original film.  The humour is perhaps more to the fore in this film, with Matthew Mcconaughey (Sp?) going way over the top and leatherface in full transvestite mode and this can sometimes work to the detriment of the film.The last half of the film keeps the tension up well, with the underlying threat that violence could explode at any moment. However too much of the acting is of the \"shout at the top of your voice\" school and by the end of the film youre wondering how many times poor Renee Zellwegger can escape and be recaptured.Overall better than the second and third entries in the series, but way behind the first.",

            "content": "Sorry, the subtitle 'Next Generation' always summons Star Trek imagery to my mind, which is the first sign that Henkel either had no clue or didn't want the film taking itself seriously. If that doesn't confirm it, the cover art does. But wait-Henkel had a hand in the original and this is the 'true' sequel? That's a joke, right? So going into the film, I expected either camp or comedy and got neither (much like the second Saw film, I might add.) Again we open up with white text and someone reading the text in case the viewer happens to be illiterate. The narration brings us up to speed on the whole TCM mythos in case some poor fool obliviously sleep-walked into the horror section and picked the movie up by mistake. Seriously, Henkel, plain white text and narration doesn't count as a TCM trademark nor a mood setting device, and I know we can find something more interesting or drop the whole thing. This is not the Star Wars 'A long time ago . . .' line and fanfare. But what do I know? I didn't co-write the original screen-play.So let's meet the teenagers to be slaughtered and explore exactly how stupid a writer can write a character. There's something about horror films featuring the lowest forms of intelligence, and this usually happens for a reason. I mean, if the characters performed the intelligent act of finding a way out of their predicament there'd be no film. But as a fan of the genre, one grows to accept this and stop caring that the characters on screen are idiots . . . to a point. TCM: Next Generation impressively managed to throw out characters that were too stupid and way too obnoxious. The possibility of Leatherface meat-hooking and slowly slicing these losers didn't appeal to me. It wasn't good enough to watch someone else torture and murder these characters-I wanted to beat and torture these characters, myself. Besides, TCM 1 proved Leatherface incapable of shutting up one screaming little girl, don't get me started on the second one, and it only gets worse here. My personal favorite line in the film (paraphrased): 'There's no place to turn around! Don't these people know how to build a road?!' What was he looking for? A U-turn sign? A driveway or big open parking lot? If that road were a bridge with guard rails any driver I know could've turned around easily. I guess the concept of a 'reverse' gear escaped these teens as well.Nevermind the lines that contradict what's shown on screen. I can still suspend my disbelief for the sake of humoring a horror flick. Especially for the moment where one guy is held at gunpoint, escapes into the gunman's house and uses the gunman's bathroom. Classic stupidity.And you know, since horror has gotten so clich\u00e9, Henkel decided to throw in some twists to the TCM formula. Hello, Leatherface in a dress (as if the makeup in the first TCM didn't already lower my opinion of Leatherhead). Hello, Men in Black. Hello, Conspiracy theory. It's actually hilarious that despite all the twists in the film how predictable everything is in terms of who lives and dies. Based on the opening credits, I predicted with 80% accuracy. Once the characters all were introduced, and I saw who filled what role that prediction was amended to be 100% accurate. Putting Leatherface in a dress was, admittingly, a ballsy move that angered many people. I don't understand why they didn't just go ahead and kill off Jenn (in a non-final-frame-jump-sequence) Note: stating this character survives is not a spoiler - if you watch this movie and honestly don't know her fate, you need help. Back to my point, killing off the star of the film would upset an equal number of people, but at least I'd walk away with the satisfaction that the writer had it in him to play with the entire story arc and resolution (it's not like these actresses are ever back for the sequel anyway \u0096 who cares if they survive?) But no, instead we get typical horror-I-survived-happy ending . . . and Leatherface in a dress. Oh yes, and since this is TCM we have to retread that stupid meat hook again, the family whose reach stretches to every character these guys encountered in the film, the dinner scene, and Leatherface running around too much with the chainsaw over his head. Homages are nice, but make your own movie. Seriously.I've never liked the TCM series, and I think the sequels prove how little juice the original had going for it. Maybe it would have shocked me in the mid-seventies, but TCM against the passage of time is just a testament that shocks are cheap.",

The movie makes the audience laugh with horror movie conventions, instead of laughing at them, unlike Scream's unfunny self-depreciating remarks.The moment when Rothman tries to visually explain to 'the family' what the meaning of horror really is, is as witty as any moment I've seen from any movie this decade, let alone a horror movie.  Other moments are almost as amusing, such as Leatherface's final chase of the heroine paying homage to the master of suspense or the reverse of the 'Energizer bunny' bad guy horror movie convention.

She seems to be doing well and then suddenly it's like she had a change of heart, or doesn't want to be there anymore, and will just deadpan a few lines before deciding to pick the pace back up a bit.McConnehey isn't bad as the resident nutcase leader, but the character itself is just ridiculous. It's full of nonsense parts (more so than your usual horror movie \"cluelessness\" from the characters) of which the ending is the biggest condensation of said nonsense. The whole \"conspiracy theory\" explanation is poorly implemented and is just the icing on the cake of absurdity.Don't get me wrong here. I like a movie that is absurd for the sake of being absurd, or movies that are accidentally good, funny, etc. This is none of those. I am avoiding spoilers by not being specific and just want to give an overall description of the film. It is not clever, it is not witty, it is not good (not even by accident). Everything falls flat in this. Like I said, the number of people giving the \"10 out of 10\" ratings are either a select few with multiple accounts, people desperate to find a meaning or something that simply is not there, people trying to concoct these \"deep meanings\" in order to seem \"complex\" and/or make themselves feel better, or any combination thereof.",

It manages to recapture the gritty grainy visual style of the original and also some of the frenetic sadism. The performances are all great and Henkel mangaes to keep most of the original story and adds enough unfamiliar twists to it to make this a far better follow up than 2. It is flawed in that the guy that plays leatherface while he is a good actor is very silly looking  they should have spent more time making him hideous.

Meanwhile the deranged Vilmer finds Sean and the wounded driver and kills them. When Jenny gets a ride from Vilmer on the desert road, she learns how crazy he is and leaves him, meeting Leatherface in the woods in an insane night.\"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", a.k.a. \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\"), is a forgettable slasher of the franchise. The greatest attraction are the unknown Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey in 1995, and they have good performances. Leatherface as a drag queen is ridiculous and the bizarre Vilmer as a psychopath with bionic leg in a bizarre family is totally insane.

Leatherface will scream like a girl and looks like a transvestite.  Before you throw away your money, there are things you must be aware of,1) There is NO chainsaw massacre. This film should be called \"The Texas Chainsaw Murder\"2) Matthew Maconahay is absolutly out of control. He plays Vilmer, Leatherface's crazy relative.  Keep a good eye out for his hillarious \"EEEEOOOOOOooooo!\" primate call when Jenny tries to make a get away.  Believe me.  This rivals Agent Smith's \"Dr. Evil laugh\" in The Matrix Revolutions   3) This film is boring and tedious. There will be minutes of footage of Jenny walking through the woods with nothing going on and you don't get to see Leatherface until the 35-40 minute mark.The script is beyond awful.  One of Jenny's friends is chased by Vilmer in a truck and his respose of absolutly no sign of fear is, \"Stop it mister. You're scaring me.\"Despite all these negative notes, I did enjoy Renee Zellweger's performance. It was kind of interesting to see her so young before she played in big budget films.All in all, don't rent this unless you are prepared to laugh your heart out.

OK, I admit, I love a cheesy, dumb movie as much as the next person, but why does a film with such legendary status have to have its reputation spoilt by pointless sequels? TCM may not be the only film with a load of crap follow-ups ( the Elm Street series, The Howling series - I could continue...)but surely it's one of the only films (not just horror) that just doesn't need a sequel. The original was so groundbreaking in many ways that it was almost perfect film making, a film that 'does exactly what it says on the tin', so to speak. Alright, TCM 2 had its moments, but was really just a cash-in without any of the style of the original. TCM 3 was pointless, but at least it had a bit of a nasty edge to it. This is just like a 'made-for-tv' style movie (remember how 'Freddy's Nightmares' compared to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'?). Anyway, basic plot for those who can be bothered - a group of kids get stranded in the woods and run into a family of maniacs. Sounds familiar? A bloke in a mask called Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen, your rightfully legendary place in cinema history is very safe!)wielding a chainsaw does not necessarily make a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie.LOOK AWAY NOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE PLOT TO BE SPOILT!There's no actual massacre involved in this film, and any killings that do take place do not involve a chainsaw! What you do get is a confusing story about people who shout a lot and run around in the woods. There's also some rubbish about the Illuminati, but I won't even bother going into that. If you want pure, gritty horror then you could do worse than watch the original TCM. If you want edge-of-your-seat tension and shocks, then watch the very classy 2003 re-make.

There are some genuinely creepy moments like when Vilmer is sticking his fingers into Jennies cheeks or when he crushes a different characters head in with his remote controlled boot. Or when Rothman sticks his tongue down her ear. Ugh! But as a TCM it fails. First of all not one person dies or is even maimed by a chainsaw.

This film is very much like the original (even though kim henkel the director teaches film studies at a texan university) you would at least think that he could produce or help produce a script which would be original and keep viewers on the edge of there seats. some of the similarities in this film to the original are when jenny is escaping from leatherface she runs into another human being who could possible help her but is actually a member of the leatherface family another similarity is the fact that the kids are basically 2 couples just like the original all the needed then was to have a disabled brother and the characters would be exactly the same as the original. in this film I don't know whether it is intentionally done but the ending is very confusing like who was that British man with his chauffeur and who was in the plane which shot wilmer(matthew mccounahey) and also right at the end when jenny is at the hospital with the police men and he is reassuring her and sally(marliyn burns) is pushed past on a hospital bed by a hospital worker (paul 'franklin' partain)when i say intentionally done maybe in 1994 when the film was made they were hoping to make a sequel with the characters sally and jenny but because renee zellweger got really famous in jerry maguire and reality bites she would never return to the series and why did matthew mccounahey try to have this film stricken from the records and have it vaulted?",

Unfortunately for our heroes, they're stranded in the wrong place. They'll spend the night fighting for their lives against a crazed family of killers.Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (TCM:TNG) is another of those movies that I really, really want to like (I've got something of a man-crush on Matthew McConaughey). Until last night, I hadn't seen the movie in at least 10 years. I sat down hoping I was wrong and it would work this time. If anything, TCM:TNG is worse than I remembered. There are scores of problems I could write about, but the main one is the film's plot - or more precisely, the lack of a plot. There's really not much here that resembles a coherent story. It's a mish-mash of recycled ideas, attempts at humor, story elements involving a secret governmental-whatever that come out of nowhere, and generally poor filmmaking. Add it all up and it's one big disaster. It's amazing to sit and watch a film with the words Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the title and not find one scary or suspenseful moment. Take McConaughey's introduction as Vilmer as an example. The movie sees fit to leave the viewer in suspense about Vilmer's intentions for no more than 10 seconds before he's revealed to be a bad guy. Why not let the character be something of a mystery for a while so that when he makes his murderous tendencies known, it's a surprise? But no, that might have made for an interesting plot twist and you can't have anything like that in TCM:TNG. A well deserved 3/10 from me.",

            "content": "This film gets a very bad rap, and understandably so. But the fact remains that it's an entertaining flick, for what it's worth.It's clear that the filmmakers knew this was Vilmer's movie. It's not really about Leatherface or chainsaw-based terror. The creators put all their eggs in one basket, and that's the character of Vilmer, played by Matthew McConaughey: he's a completely fun, over-the-top psycho who obsessively delights in scaring teens. Literally every other character in the film exists to support his performance in some way.And there's the problem: A big chunk of the film takes place before Vilmer shows up, and it just follows extremely generic teens who spend too much time 1) whining and 2) wandering around the woods while nothing happens. There are some funny lines, but they're too few and far between; it's a big problem when the original TCM was made by amateurs in the 1970s yet had way better pacing & more interesting characters.The pacing is the number 1 problem with this film. It drags and drags one-note scenes out for way too long; some of them are boring, while others are supposed to be tense (like the chase scenes) but just feel stupid because they're so dull.And it's a shame, because this movie's heart is in the right place. As mentioned, the bonkers character of Vilmer is a treat, but the ironic twists in the film have a lot of potential too. I loved the moments where the victims say something really understated in the middle of being menaced. I loved the scene where Vilmer's girlfriend meekly hits a victim with a stick before politely giving up. I loved the scene where a teen locks himself in the villains' house and thinks he's outsmarted his captors; it would have been great to see that wiseass character deal with the situation some more, but he's killed off way too fast--And that's a perfect example of the movie's problems.It has a few really good ideas, but it needed another rewrite to really expand on them and use them well. Everything is just half-baked and never really delivers; there's no satisfaction or punchline to anything. For instance, Vilmer talks about how much he loves scaring people, so why are his first 2 kills so incredibly boring & lame?On top of that, the execution is just incompetent, with terrible lighting and really drab, dull scenes of characters bumbling around in extremely boring locations. There's absolutely no atmosphere or spookiness to the woods, and everything just looks really bland. And there's really no reason for Leatherface to be in this movie; he's just there because the director thought a \"creepy transvestite\" would be a novel, mind-blowing concept... which it isn't.It's a movie that had potential and could've been really good. But Kim Henkel simply wasn't competent enough to make it work, and the result is a mess that's just boring too much of the time. All the same, I definitely enjoyed this more than the 1986 TCM 2; while this movie had its heart in the right place and was botched by bad execution, TCM 2 was just an embarrassingly campy & stupid concept even if it had a competent execution. I can respect this film for what it attempted to be, at the least. If you're patient or if you fast-forward through the dull scenes, I would honestly recommend this film for its creative aspects.",

Knowing what a star she has become, i thought she'd add much better acting to the film that Mathew had lacked. The best acting was from the old loser who kept reciting famous historical quotes. I was diapointed with the acting, but this film is also not as demented and eerie as the original. I did however enjoy the courage that Renee built when she grabbed the rifle as Mathew was on the ground in one scene. I found myseld rooting for this heroin more than the female captive in the original. One last comparison is the terror in the leading lady. The female lead in TCM showed much much much more fear that Renee did. Then again, the original leading lady wasn't put to ease as Renee was by Mathew's girlfriend, wife, or ex-wife in this saga's contribution. Overall, i give it (out of 10) a 5.

Allow me to simplify in point form 1. The script. Welcome to confusion 3 minutes into the film. Who are these people? Why did four people who seem to hate each other drive away from the prom, and then keep driving? Why then did they complain there's nowhere to turn around on an unbarricaded country road? Why bother making character development when it serves only to confuse the storyline further? 2. The characters. Who cares if they die. Who cares why they kill. Why does the crazy tow truck guy have a hydraulic mechanical leg that works with any remote control? Why does leatherface suddenly want to be a woman? What's the goddamn deal with the slutty woman and the pizzas? 3. Run woman, run! How man times can you escape and be recaptured? How is it you can be in the middle of the woods one minute then be chased by leatherface the next? It suggests leatherface and his family communicate via mobile phone to inform each other of the whereabouts of potential victims. Mmmm, unexplained murders.4. The conspiracy theory. Utterly pointless addition to the movie, suggesting that the crazy family of skin fetish, cross dressing, semi cyborg taxidermists are somehow at the whim of a secret organisation responsible for killing JFK and scaring girls on prom night.As you can see, this movie explains none of its ridiculous actions, characters or general happenings. You're left with an hour and a half worth of questions! Please, I beg of you, ignore anyone who says this movie is half way decent. This film is BAD BAD BAD. 1/10.",

            "content": "People have criticised the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as being a weak film compared to its ancestor. Those who have defended it say, among other things, that compared to The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is a masterpiece. This argument is invalidated by the fact that compared to The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, ninety-five minutes of Anna Paquin burping and farting in tune should be considered a masterpiece. In case I haven't made it clear yet, my comments refer to the 1997 reissued cut.Have you ever encountered a story, a film, or some other piece of art that is so utterly stupid it is brilliant? The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw is so stupid it becomes brilliant then painful within minutes of each other. A film critic once wrote that the lengthier a title is, the worse the film will often be. He also wrote that when a film changes title for a rerelease or international release, that is a bad sign. This film has had two titles, these being The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. If the length of these two titles doesn't set off alarm bells, then the list of plot stupidities in this film will.I won't go into every idiotic point of this film. My personal favourite is the hick with a mechanically-enhanced leg that can be controlled by remote. Yes, you read that right. Zellweger's character defeats him by stealing his remote and making his leg thrash about. Yes, you read that right, too. One of the other victims is put up on a hook that goes through the back of her shoulder. Mere hours in the continuity of the film pass by before she is found crawling on a dirt road. Then a millionaire comes by, and it is revealed that this millionaire is paying the family to behave in this manner, for reasons that are not even given a pretense of explanation.Mind you, those are just the stand-out examples of the film's idiocy. What Tobe Hooper brought to the original TCM was apparently things like plot cohesion, or even characters doing things that make sense. The only reason to watch this cinematic abortion, put simply, is to see big-name stars at their lowest point. Zellweger and McConaughey, quite simply, must have agents whose farts smell like Chanel No. 5, and whose urine tastes like champagne. James Gale sums it up best: \"This...all of this...it's been an abomination. You really must accept my sincere apologies. It was supposed to be a spiritual experience. I can't tell you how disappointed I am\". I think he was inserted as a proxy for Kim Henkel.If I had to give The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a score, it would be a big one out of ten. It excels alright, at failure. Like Howling: New Moon Rising, it proves that no matter how low a franchise sinks, there is always somewhere lower it can go. People who thought Friday The 13th Part VIII or Freddy's Dead were rock bottom have absolutely no idea.",

            "content": "'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' franchise has it's fair share of movies that are poor, but this one really takes the biscuit. Even for TCM, this is truly abysmal and even fans of the franchise will find it near on impossible to get through this. Although TCM as a franchise tends to have it's more comedic/wacky movies and the more serious/scary ones, Next Generation takes it much too far to the wacky side of the spectrum. I'm all for wackiness and my enjoyment fo the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Child's Play' franchises serves as proof of that, but this is just TOO absurd to the point that it's not even remotely funny. Everything is over the top, irrational and nonsensical. The plot was non-existent with no coherent or obvious story present. Despite well known names such as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey starring, this movie is shockingly awful. McConaughy's over the top acting seems to become even more dramatic and is practically unwatchable. The overall acting from all the cast is dreadful, with no redeeming qualities. What else do you expect when they're playing a bunch of psychotic freaks with no humanistic qualities at all? Although screaming and yelling is to be expected in a horror movie, this takes it to a new and ridiculous level. 90% of the movie consists of high pitched squealing and frantic screams to the point that I was forced to mute the TV. The dialogue was actually out-done by the screaming. Unsurprisingly, I didn't manage to get to the end of this movie and don't feel I missed out on anything. In fact, I think I saved myself from wasting any more of my life watching this atrocity. Save yourselves the torture and skip this movie on your watch of the TCM franchise.",

            "content": "Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The (1994) 1/2 (out of 4)Director/writer Kim Henkel was the man behind the screenplay to that legendary 1974 hit and he returned to this film in hopes of it being a direct sequel. No matter what the original idea was, this film, when it was finally released after countless years, is a complete disaster from the start. Four kids (one played by Renee Zellweger) leave their prom and end up on a back road where they're attacked and tortured by the psychotic family led by Leatherface. This \"sequel\" is pretty much just a remake but with some strange sense of humor that never works. I'm really not sure what they were trying here because the film is a complete mess that never really makes any sense. The film has Leatherface pretty much playing a scream queen as he's constantly putting on make up be it lip stick or fingernail polish. Okay, for a comedy. That would make you think you're watching a comedy but the very next scene will be something extremely dark that puts you back into a horror film. The entire movie jumps back and forth and it's not because they're trying to mix the genres but I think it's because no one was really paying attention to trying to make a good film. The dialogue is without question horrid and just take a listen to the scene where one of the killers has murdered one man in front of another and the man that's still alive says \"you're scaring me\" as if he hadn't witnessed anything major yet. Even dumber is the kids getting lost even though they're driving in their town and are only a few minutes away from their school. I know there are two versions of this thing and I've seen them both and neither one adds any sense. The screenplay doesn't seem to know anything except that it likes to show scenes of the female characters being tortured. The women here are kicked, punched, slapped, poked, spit on, flicked, shocked and countless other things. I'm not one of those who are against violence towards women in horror films but this movie is just pathetic in how cheap it is all around. Matthew McConaughey is actually fairly good in his role as he's clearly hamming it up just so he can at least say he's entertaining. Zellweger is also pretty good considering the screenplay doesn't leave her too much to do. In the end, this is without question the worst film in the series and I'm still not sure what on earth the filmmakers were thinking. It's a complete mess from start to finish and it's a film that could have sat on the shelf for a couple decades without the need to be released.",

            "content": "The original film is great, the second film was alright, the third film was adequate, and this was the final official sequel before the remakes came along, but unfortunately, it did not turn out as I expected or hoped it would. Basically, in the mid-1990s, teenagers Jennifer \"Jenny\" (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer), Barry (Tyler Shea Cone), and Sean (John Harrison) are celebrating during their senior prom. They are driving through Texas when they are forced to take a detour off the freeway. Heather makes a wrong turn, driving them into a remote area. Distracted, after thinking she saw something, she crashes into another driver. They get out and help the shaken driver, Sean looks after him while the others look for help. Heather, Barry, and Jenny find a rural real estate office, there insurance agent Darla (Tonie Perensky) calls up her boyfriend Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey), a tow truck driver, to help them. Meanwhile, Heather and Barry are separated from Jennifer. Vilmer eventually arrives at the crash scene, where he breaks the driver's neck and chases Sean in his pickup, eventually running him over. Meanwhile, Heather and Barry come across a dilapidated farmhouse. Barry goes inside and asks Walter (Joe Stevens), Vilmer's brother to use the bathroom. While waiting on the porch, Heather is captured by Leatherface (introducing Robert Jacks), who stuffs her inside a meat locker. Meanwhile, Barry discovers human remains in the bathroom, then he is bludgeoned to death by Leatherface. Afterwards, the killer removes Heather from the meat locker and hangs her on a meat hook. Jennifer returns to the car and meets Vilmer, who shows her the bodies of Sean and the driver, and then chases her in his truck, but she escapes into the woods. Leatherface attempts to attack her, chasing her wielding a chainsaw, until she makes it back to Darla's office, begging for help. But Darla and Walter are accomplices, they subdue Jenny and take her to the Sawyer family home. Jennifer falls unconscious and awakens at a dinner table with the cannibalistic family. Joining them is a mysterious suited man named Mr. Rothman (James Gale), a member of a secret organisation responsible for many of the world's major events. He has hired the family to show \"the true meaning of horror\" but criticises them for botching their mission. After Mr. Rothman leaves, a furious Vilmer kills Heather, crushing her skull. Jennifer tries to escape but is held down by Vilmer as Leatherface prepares to kill her. However, she manages to hurt Vilmer and escapes. Fleeing to the main road, Jenny is helped by an elderly couple in an RV, but the vehicle is turned over by Vilmer and Leatherface, forcing Jennifer to run. Eventually, an airplane appears overhead and hits Vilmer's skull with its blade, killing him. Jenny is picked up by a passing black limousine, but she is shocked to find Rothman inside. He tells Jenny that her experience was supposed to be spiritual, but it went wrong and that Vilmer had to be stopped. She is dropped off at a hospital, where police question her. Also starring Chris Kilgore as Rothman's Chauffeur, Vince Brock as I'm Not Hurt, Susan Loughran as Jenny's Mother, David Laurence as Jenny's Stepfather, and Grayson Victor Schirmacher as Grandfather. As the films have continued, the violence and blood spill have increased and gone more over-the-top, but this 90s offering hardly has any deaths or gory stuff at all, and that makes it a real disappointment. There is nothing wrong with up-and-coming and established stars Zellweger and McConaughey, but there should have been much more of iconic masked murderer Leatherface, the pace was uneven, the story is dull, and to be honest, I felt bored almost the entire way through with hardly anything worthwhile happening, a most disappointing and hardly mentionable horror.

            "content": "Soft-spoken introvert Jenny (Renee Zellwegger) along with her friends Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer), Sean (John Harrison), and Heather's boyfriend Barry (Tyler Cone) attend their high school Prom and soon after a Heather finds Barry making out with a random girl find themselves driving on the Texas backroads until another car crashes into them leaving them stranded. As they search for help, a tow truck driver named Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) arrives at the scene and is but only the first of several escalating instances of insane violence that will befall the group over the night.Following failed attempts by studios Cannon Films and New Line Cinema to successfully exploit the legacy of the 1974 horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with the sequels Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III respectively, the rights reverted to the original film's co-writer Kim Henkel who produced the low budget follow up in The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (later retitled Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation) which like the original was produced on location in the state of Texas using local actors and resources. Eventually procured for distribution by Columbia only for the film to become buried at the insistence of parties with vested interests in the careers of Renee Zellwegger and Mathew McConaughey putting pressure on Columbia to bury the film in a limited release of only about 20 theaters where it fell into relative obscurity and received negative reviews from whatever critics saw it (with the exception of Joe Bob Briggs who was one of the film's few Champions). Over time the movie has become cult favorite thanks to its absolutely bonkers take on the franchise as well as the early appearances by McConaughey and Zellwegger, and there is entertainment value to be had, but that by no means makes it \"good\".Aside from Zellwegger's Jenny, the rest of the teens are very broad stereotypes you've seen before who fall in line with brainless airhead, jock jerk, and stoner and are basically just there to pad out the body count. The impetus that brings them to the backroads of Texas as a group no less is pretty contrived even by the standards of slasher films that need to find ways of isolating a group of characters from the rest of the world so they can be picked off by whatever monster or killer is lurking around. But there's a strange awkward charm that comes from the interactions in our group as their written to be such braindead kill fodder that it's almost like it's trying to be parody of this type of movie but never quite crossing that line into full on parody.McConaughey plays, Vilmer, the de facto patriarch of the family this time around (I'm honestly not sure if they're still the Sawyer family) and regardless of the quality of the movie around him, he is not pulling punches with his performance as he chews his way through the scene arguably decimating more of it than Leatherface's chainsaw. The rest of the family all have their quirk with Leatherface now a crossdresser (which is explained by him adopting the identity of whoever's face he wears), Joe Stevens' W. E. playing a guntoting psycho who's basically this movie's equivalent of Chop Top or the Hitchhiker down to his similar movements except his quirk is randomly quoting different people ranging from Ulysses S. Grant to Voltaire, and lastly we have Tonie Perensky's Darla who's Vilmer's (I think) girlfriend whose relationship shifts on a dime from violent pummeling to ravenous sex and believes Vilmer to be ingrained in some \"secret society\".The movie follows many of the same beats as in the original 1974 film with characters being locked in a deep freeze, a character gets stuck in the back with a meathook, Leatherface even once again destroys the front door of the house though admittedly it does lead to a pretty impressive set piece with Leatherface chasing Jenny on the roof with some pretty impressive stunt work. And once again we have yet another rendition of the famous \"Dinner table scene\" which again has grandpa sawyer (I think, I could've sworn he was killed in one of the sequels but who knows) and it strikes all the expected beats with the exception of the addition of a plot point that I think is supposed to be self-referential commentary but I'm not even sure the movie knows at this point.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a rehash of the 1974 original but its such an odd rehash with a multitude of awkward scenes and WTH sequences that any description I give of it can't possibly do it justice. From the surrealness of seeing early appearances by Renee Zellwegger and Mathew McConaughey to the tone that never lets you know whether it's in on the joke or not, I'm not going to forget TCM: The Next Generation. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was self-aware in its insanity, but Next Generation definitely falls into that \"So bad, it's good\" camp and will make a welcome addition to the collection and repertoire of riffers in need of schlock to play on the TV with their friends as beer and pizza boxes adorn the coffee table.",

I am really at a loss for words in many ways to describe just how bad, ridiculous, appalling, and horrible this film is. A group of teenagers are out on prom night when they are redirected on the road down another route only to find a car with a kid hit them, a beautiful Realtor in a cheap office late at night with a neighbor across the street who is never explained, a variety of people going through this place where we are led to believe these terrible atrocities that are about to ensue could happen, and, of course, the house with the crazed killers. Who would these killers be: (1)Matthew McConauhey as Vilmer - a crazed psychotic with a powered mechanical leg who takes a knife to his body(shirtless of course)repeatedly, yells maniacally throughout, beats his girlfriend, steps on another girl's face, bites said girls nose almost off, etc... (2)W. E. - Joe Stevens plays the cattle-prodding brother who quotes(and misquotes) the likes of Thoraeu, Macciavelli, and others whilst having virtually nothing else to do except mercilessly poke and prod girls with a cattle prod(who knew prod could be such a versatile word?) (3)Darla - Tonie Perensky as Vilmer's supposedly almost stable girlfriend who is the Realtor and seems to enjoy the high of being with a man with a powered leg, a girlfriend beater, and living in a squalid house where there is no way in hell that she could dress as nice as she does for her job. Perensy is about the only thing I really did enjoy in the film. Not for her performance but for her bust of which we are given a brief but gratifying look at. Other than that she wildly acts hysterically throughout. (4)Grandfather - a truly thankless role as he is in one scene and has nothing to do. ... and, finally, (5) Leatherface - played by Robert Jacks and giving an absurd portrayal of this clownish killer figure. Watch the ending as he wields that chainsaw after the ludicrous Winebago scene. I almost fell out of my recliner laughing at the cinematic ineptitude of that sequence, the lack of directorial competence, and Jacks playing it way - WAY - over the top. Yes, Renee Zellweger plays the main tortured soul who has to watch these crazed thespians(way to generous here with that appellation)run amuck in a disgusting house. She isn't very good either but does manage to evoke mediocrity here and there - almost some credibility in the beginning of the film. You are never really sure where this film is going. Is it trying to be camp, horror, grotesque comedy, or a combination? I never really knew which it was trying to aspire to but do know that it achieved none. This film is just a really bad film with some supposedly good talent. The acting as aforementioned is universally bad. The writing is just ridiculous: what is with the Realtor angle? Who is Rothman? What happens at the end? Who was that guy in the bathroom at the top room upstairs that gives a gun to a girl? How did Vilmer get his legs like that? So many questions and virtually no answers. Yes, I know films like this don't have to have lots of answers but they need something to bridge the gap between imagination and credibility. The bridge here was blown right out of the water. Most of all, the biggest reason this film fails is due to the uninsightful, gratuitous, poorly crafted direction of one-time director Kim Henkel. I really didn't see anything in this film that cried out for his talent. Sure, I have seen a lot worse than this and there are many, many films which are crafted even more poorly. But when one connects the material with the cast and everything else - potential must be factored in to the equation as well. This one doesn't come even remotely close to the sum of what its parts could have been. A total bust(remember that was the only highlight- highlights).",

Its not trying to be scary, its not trying to gore you into submission, its just something to pass the time, make a few bucks, and let the studio decide if a part 5 is worth while.

The actor who plays him does the worst job of any of the other actors. The whole movie is a total mess. Mostly its just people running around a house getting tormented. At least the original had a creepy atmosphere this one has nothing.No scares and not much of an entertainment value. The only amusing thing is Matthew McConaughey who plays Vilmer a crazed killer but thats not enough to save the movie. Later Leatherface turns female, thats just dumb. Why do that? This is easily the worst of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies.",

From start to finish, this thing is a complete load of nonsense and extremely irritating crap! Not ONE line that is spoken by anyone of the performers makes even a tad bit of sense. In fact, your ears start to hurt after a while from listening to all that useless and dumb chatting. You cannot believe what they dare to bring to the screen here. The dialogs and one-liners without a doubt belong to the crappiest that were ever written. Give a typewriter to a 5-year-old child and he'll do a better job than Kim Henkel did. And they don't have to start claiming it's meant to be like this and that it's supposed to be a comical spoof.because it's too idiotic to be a comedy and too painfully amateurish to be a spoof. There's another name for it.rubbish!In every possible way, this pile of garbage is a disgrace to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and blasphemy to the genre of horror. There's no structure to be found whatsoever! Characters are disappearing all of a sudden and they don't get mentioned anymore thorough the whole movie, while other, newly introduced types are supposed to fit in right away. The members of the maniacal family are stupid, empty and utterly annoying. Especially the image of Leatherface is messed up badly. All of a sudden, he suffers from a serious identity crisis got really lame. Even when he's appearing in his most 'scary' form, he's only a glimpse of the portrayal Gunnar Hansen once gave. I guess the local and ambitious wannabe stars Zellweger and McConaughey would have done anything at that point of their careers to be noticed.I'm surprised they grew out to be famous after this anyhow! They should be pointed at and laughed for being part of this piece of junk. Writer-director Kim Henkel had her 15 minutes of fame when she co-wrote the original, along with Tobe Hooper. She now turned into a complete joke herself. TCM: The Next Generation isn't even bad enough to be good.it's bad, period.",

Leatherface becoming a transsexual or whatever it was? Since when? And that screaming... horrible. And now he's destroying brick chimneys with his chainsaw. Even the Leatherface's hairstyle is horrendous. One of the genre's listed on IMDb for this movie is \"comedy\". I didn't see any. If there was comedy, it was awful. Story is also a bold \"what the f*ck\". More importantly - there was no gore! A Texas chain saw massacre movie and no gore. Something doesn't quite go together, does it? What was up with the \"don't hit me\" scene? It was like a 90yr old woman hitting a mentally retarded kid. Thank god that Kim Henkel understood that he is not a good director and didn't continue to work as a director. Just do yourself a favor and skip this part of the franchise.",

            "content": "After the fiasco of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 was released in film and video completely shredded, displeasing most viewers (the uncut version was only released on DVD in 2001 over 10 years later), excellent news sparked great anticipation among viewers. Fans of the series: a fourth The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would be made, with the direct participation of Kim Henkel, the screenwriter of the original classic. To improve, Henkel would not only be an executive producer, but also the screenwriter and director of this new sequel, which, moreover, would be done independently, so as not to suffer the same censorship of part 3. Could it be better? Of course! That's why it's strange that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre- Return has been the worst movie in the franchise so far.It is possible to say that nothing is saved in this repetitive and bland plot. Kim Henkel, screenwriter of the first film, returns as director (and also takes over the script) in this film that is basically a retelling of the 1974 classic: a group of young people have a minor car accident while leaving graduation festivities. When looking for help in the surroundings, which means going through a stretch of forest to get in touch with a house/establishment, the young people come across the family of \"degenerates\" and the bloodbath enters Leatherface's agenda... In this beginning, the prom isn't even shown, as Jenny's friend Heather fights with her boyfriend Barry and the four young men hit the road. The characters are so ridiculous that Henkel doesn't even try to write interesting dialogue for them in the first ten minutes of the film, when we should at least get to know the young people better. What presents itself is the traditional conversation about sex, and nothing more. Soon, there is an unlikely car accident on a country road, and the inevitable separation of the group: Jenny, Barry, and Heather go for help while Sean stays with the driver of the other car, who is injured. The trio meets Darla, a tow truck attendant, who calls her brother Vilmer to pick up the cars. Vilmer is Matthew McCaughey, another who is in an awkward start to his career (this is his fourth film).At the same time, Jenny returns in search of her boyfriend while Heather and Barry find a home in the middle of the forest. There's Leatherface (Robert Jacks, horrible!), with a mask that doesn't even convince. Leatherface kills Barry with a sledgehammer to the head (identical to one of the young men in the original film), traps Heather in a freezer (ditto) and then hangs her on a meat hook (identical to the first movie!!!!!). The difference is that, in the original, the girl hanging from the hook showed pain and fear, while here the terrible actress doesn't even scream convincingly, and we don't even see blood dripping from the wound (she has a hook stuck in her back!!!!).That leaves Jenny, who spends the other 50 minutes running around, running from the killers, being arrested, running away again, being arrested, fighting with them, getting beaten up, being tortured, mistreated, and so on. Some of these chases are good, like the one on the roof, others not so good - until we get to the messy end. Any normal person would be horrified, traumatized by half of what Jenny goes through in the movie, but she keeps her sanity, not screaming, not even showing fear and horror, as Marilyn Burns did so well in the original movie. Since the beginning of the so-called \"tension and horror\" that the director wanted to rescue from the original, we see that the trip will be long - and not pleasant. The weak script gives us the worst characters in the franchise, a kind of stereotypes from the original movie - and with incredibly stupid dialogue. Some chase scenes are pretty silly, and most of them are done by Vilmer, like the one where he chases Sean or Jenny in the car.And the quotes from the first film don't stop there: at one-point Jenny is chased by Leatherface through the woods, with the chainsaw buzzing incessantly, until she finds shelter in the towing service, where she thinks Darla is a friend, but she, in fact, she is part of the psychopath family (exactly what happens in the first movie, when Sally is helped by Cook Dreyton Sawyer!!!!). As we all know, it's never good to trust Texas people, especially in a Chainsaw Massacre movie. Jenny is then tied up (as with Marilyn Burns in the original), bagged (ditto) and taken back to the house (ditto), placed on the dinner table (as in the first movie) for another screaming and torture session.... It's impossible not to mention that on the way to the house, inside Darla's car, Jenny screams, cries and kicks, then the villain threatens her: Stop screaming immediately! For the imprisoned girl not only stops crying and complaining at the same moment, but also speaks, totally dismayed: Okay, but I'm not able to breathe, with the greatest calm in the world, as if I were a crying child who just got a Mom's ear poke! And she doesn't scream anymore, even when Darla is approached by a police officer - and a scream from Jenny could betray that the woman was a kidnapping psychopath.Despite several passages identical to the original, this fourth chapter doesn't even come close to the first. In addition to not having a minimum of violence and horror (no one is butchered for dinner, for example, nor is there any mention of cannibalism; what it seems is that everyone is crazy, and that's it), the film becomes ridiculous and comical in several moments, especially in the bad characterization of Leatherface, who spends most of the film dressed as a woman (with dress and makeup), screaming and even taking orders from Jenny (who, at one point, yells at him to sit down and shut up. Mouth, and that's exactly what old Leatherface does!!!).In fact, Leatherface doesn't do anything else in the movie. He appears as a transvestite, visibly overweight and dressed as a woman, and is totally overshadowed by Vilmer, who suddenly becomes the film's biggest villain. Then, just when we think it can't get any worse, Jenny is tied to a chair at the family dinner table and a man in a limousine appears out of nowhere, dressed like an executive, with a refined English accent. And he goes into the psychopath's house as if he were a member of the family. Jenny thinks he went to save her, but actually he's crazy too; Rothman then starts grabbing her and licking her, and his chest is slashed with scars and piercings!!!! The mysterious character approaches Vilmer and says: You know why you are here.... I want these people to go through the truest horror. Did you understand? Well, neither do I! Nobody bothers to explain, either, what kind of family relationship those completely different misfits have - do Leatherface, Vilmer and Darla have any kinship, for example? And what happened to the original's family, if The Return would be a direct continuation of the first movie? The only members of the original family present are Leatherface and Grandpa (of course!).If Renee Zellweger never comes across as a helpless, life-threatening young girl, the worst interpretation by far is McCaughey, who plays a hysterical type, always screaming and wanting to be badass and scary, when in fact is the most caricatured and unfunny villain in recent times. When he wants to look scary, he widens his eyes and starts screaming. But the worst is when he has a tantrum and starts mutilating himself with a knife (just like Hitchhiker does in the original movie).Lacking in rhythm, The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is weak, tasteless and presents us with a psychopath without any impact, armed with his chainsaw, but unable to act because of producers concerned with censorship. All in all, this fourth part is a total mess, it tries to bring new elements to Leatherface's story and make some references to the '74 classic, but it only let the viewer more confused. The script doesn't even try to give a greater sense of clarity. Everything ends up in a disastrous ending, full of holes and meaningless theories. Every 10 minutes, the story introduces new elements, without any fuss, which leaves everything messy and poorly done. Presenting us with a mob bow and a Leatherface drag queen, this movie is completely unnecessary, comical, offensive and bad, but really bad. No wonder the franchise hit rock bottom after this movie and only reinvented itself after the remake, in 2003.",

            "content": "In the mid-1970s, Tobe Hooper had unleashed horror in a new way to moviegoers with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). It was a film that had so much going for it. It may have been outrageously controversial for its depiction of sadistic violence but it served its purpose in being a scary film. It relied on simplicity and minimalism in order to drive its viewers crazy. Then Hooper created the long awaited sequel that confused his original fans by attempting to keep continuity while simultaneously changing everything else. It turned out being more of spoof of itself than being a sequel. When the franchise finally released its second sequel, it was even more mixed in reception due to its further lack of connection to the last two movies even though its title said otherwise. At that point, it would've been thought that maybe the franchise was suffering from lack of attention. Apparently the next sequel (this one) shockingly was neglected even further. It by far is the most confusing and disappointing to say the least.The overall idea behind the story is no different from that of the other movies before it. A group of teens end up crossing paths with Leatherface and his notorious family of cannibals. This sequel was written and directed Kim Henkel, the original co-writer to the original film that blew everyone away. According to Hinkel it was supposed to be the official sequel to the original film. As to what he thought consisted of making it the official sequel is barely visible. The writing is all over the place and the continuity is very unfaithful. Like the films before it, it begins with a monologue recounting the past events, yet it was supposed to ignore them too. So how does that work? There's also a subplot about Leatherface's family having some kind of government connection or something along those lines. Allegedly they report to a higher authority and their motives go higher than their personal needs? The most painful part of the writing belongs to the dialog and the actors don't make it any better.Almost the entire cast essentially is an over the top exaggeration of some horror trope but worse. Starring as the heroine is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger best known for her breakout role in Jerry Maguire (1996). She's also accompanied by Lisa Marie Newmyer as Heather, who constantly spouts out useless sentences that don't add anything to develop her role. There's also Tyler Shea Cone playing Heather's boyfriend Barry who is none the more likable. They also come across a local who tries to help them played by Tonie Perensky. All of which can't deliver a line that sounds the least bit believable. The only thing that really keeps a viewers' attention is because of how bad the actors are. The only actor who has some saving grace (for himself) is now esteemed actor Matthew McConaughey playing Vilmer, a member of Leatherface's family. McConaughey just hams it up playing his role as psychotic as possible. Playing Leatherface is Robert Jacks who is annoyingly bad because all he does is scream nonstop.The only other positives worth mentioning are the practical and makeup effects. There's not an abundance of practical effects but the fact that it was used shows effort. The same could be said for the makeup. McConaughey's character is part robotic with a hydraulic leg and that does make it interesting to see. How he got that way and as to where he came from, if this is the \"official sequel\" to the original, is never explained either. What a surprise. This is it though for pluses. Even though there are practical effects, there is almost no gore to this movie. It makes the previous film to this franchise look bloodthirsty. It's actually very surprising. With all the inhumane and off putting scenes that involve grotesque acts, there's hardly a drop of blood shown throughout the running time to this movie. Sure, minimalism works to an extent but if nothing else is really working in the overall product, at least give the audience something visual.That also goes for background elements. The director of photography to this project was Levie Isaacks. Isaacks is best known for being the DP to movies of Guyver (1991) and the infamous horror movie Leprechaun (1993). The work that Isaacks presents here isn't much to talk about. Much of the shots throughout the film consist of turning away from anything gory and refusing to place any establishing shots. Viewers will see the disarray of the cannibal house but there's no real setup. The films before it at least had some kind of arrangement. Here it's just everything everywhere with no real order and it's boring. For music, Wayne Bell from the original film returns and his composition is uneventful too. There are moments where he creates a tune or two that establish a nice sense of dread but other than that there's nothing memorable about it. Much of the instruments involved are synthesizers and since it is not used properly, the audio is rarely effective. So sad it got this bad.It's a shocking film all right. It's shocking that people who were involved with the original returned and had completely forgotten what made it so unique. Matthew McConaughey is possibly the only actor who tries (somewhat) and there are some okay looking effects. The rest isn't good. It makes the other sequels before it look like it they had better writers. Not even a gorehound would enjoy this.",

            "content": "In a long line of sequels to the cult classic 1974 slasher film by the late Tobe Hooper, this has to be one of the worst of the bunch. To director Kim Henkel's credit, the aim was to connect to the original film which is admirable though the effort ultimately falls flat on its face.Following the franchise's clich\u00e9 of young teens getting lost only to wind up being victims of the chainsaw wielding Leatherface (played here by Robert Jacks instead of original actor Gunnar Hansson), the real villain is the iconic maniac's deranged brother, Vilmer, which isn't a bad move. Riddled with the typical antics of the dumb teens lost in the woods who are then picked off just makes you want the film to end as quickly as possible.In one of her earliest roles is future Oscar winner Renee Zellweger as the virginal heroine, Jenny. Zellweger hits the traditional scream queen requirements with lots of screaming and desperate running from the bad guys and of course surviving in the long run. However there is little to care about when the actress says such clich\u00e9 lines as \"why are you doing this?\" to \"please don't kill me\" even though she is the final girl and is meant to get away. Jenny's best quality is that she isn't quite as dumb as her friends who quickly bit the bullet within twenty to thirty minutes of each other, but of course Jenny stupidly ends up falling into a trap set by the villains and flimsily tries to escape.The film's sole bright spot has to the absolutely outlandish and utterly deranged performance of future Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as the psychotic Vilmer. The native Texan's initial appearance is abrupt and unsettling as we don't know what will happen, but when McConaughey subtly starts making threats it's clear there is something wrong with him. Even the actor's laughter is hauntingly melodic and deeply frightening as he first chases one of the teens with his truck and then effortlessly runs down the teen. Vilmer becomes even more psychotic once he and his crazed pack get their paws on Renee Zellweger's Jenny as Vilmer terrorizes the teen in horrifying ways from his disturbing hits on the pretty blonde, to his cannibalistic attack on ill-fated Heather and then his deranged ramblings. McConaughey switches from a caged tiger waiting to explode to going ballistic within a matter of seconds where he hollers, turns animalistic with utter cruelty and displays a sickening charm putting the viewer on edge, feeling defiled as the actor commands the screen.",

Why, why, why, why, why? Was the constant question that kept popping up in my brain while watching this turkey. I saw the cut version and I highly doubt I missed anything noteworthy. Added gore wouldn't change my opinion on this dreck. There is no suspense what so ever (Aside from an admittedly decent rooftop sequence), it is rather dull, and it really doesn't take itself all that seriously. Where to begin on all the flaws. I'll start with Leatherface. Gone, is the terror that Leatherface provides, replaced by a shrill scream that can give even the calmest people of headaches. It got to the point where I almost muted my T.V. He also wears lipsticks, dressing up like a transvestite. For someone who wanted to make a true sequel to the original, Kim Henkel pis**** all over it instead. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters in this one, I wanted them all to perish. Also, how is it that the villains are so attractive? I had a hard time believing that someone with Matthew McConaughery's looks could be that sadistic, as well as Renee Zellweger being \"ugly\" , as she is inexplicably called in this film. Zellweiger does what she can with the awful material, but her character is stupidly written to the point where I wanted to smack her one. This was released in 1997 to try to take advantage of Zellweger & McConaughery's surging popularity. Speaking of McConaughery... he is probably the best thing in this film. He gives a completely over the top and unhinged performance. He was a blast to watch on many occasions. He knew what a piece of crap this was, as evident when he tried to prohibit this from being distributed in theaters, so he had some fun with the role. Robert Jacks is a disgrace to Leatherface. It isn't entirely his fault though. The rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning, aside from the Marilyn Burns cameo at the end. Blink and you'll miss it.Final Thoughts: Even the most die-hard fans of TCM will despise this film. If you're a masochist, then by all means view this movie. If you have enough beers, this MIGHT be good for a few laughs, but it would take quite a few beer DUD",

            "content": "The first \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" was a rarity: a true horror film that genuinely delivers shocks and scares. It may not have been the most explicitly violent of the genre, but in the long run, it was one of the best. It success put a young director, Tobe Hooper, on the map, though he has yet to live up to his early promise. He attempted to revitalize 1980s horror movies by giving us a sequel to TCM; the result was a critical failure, only marginally successful at the box-office. Although TCM 2 was seriously flawed, especially with a somewhat tedious buildup, it wisely refused to recycle the original material, leaving us with an uneven but often invigorating dark comedy. The third film ignored its predecessor entirely; although it was more faithful to the original, the it failed to add anything new to the table, making the material tired and overtly familiar. When the fourth film went into production, some fans must have felt a renewed sense of hope; this time it was being directed by Kim Henkel, cowriter of the original. Perhaps this time someone would finally get it right?No such luck; \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 4\" is the latest of many entries on a long list of mediocre horror sequels. It's not a badly made film, but it's almost as forgettable as the last one. It does have a few oddities to its credit, however. The strangest thing about the film is that they didn't even try to make Leatherface scary; he's just a big clown with a chainsaw who's more likely to cower than to terrify. Not only that, but he's a cross-dresser as well; in one scene he primps up in a way that recalls memories of Buffalo Bill in \"Silence of the Lambs.\" It's amazing that they would make such a poor decision for the character, but his treatment here does have an odd fascination. The last third even tosses in an \"X-Files\"-style conspiracy subplot, the nature of which is never adequately explained. I suspect it was thrown in at the last minute or something. It doesn't help that the whole setup feels contrived.The film features future stars Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, who undeniably make it a practice to leave this project out of their resumes. Admittedly, Zellweger does a reasonably good job under the circumstances, but her presence primarily serves to remind us that even major performers begin their careers in smaller (and occassionally embarrassing) roles. Henkel throws in a few \"smoke machine\" effects but he can do little to liven up such a sloppy script. In a way though, it has some curiosity value since at least it's willing to be a bit off-center. Still, the original TCM was best left as a stand-alone movie; to be fair to the people who gave us the sequels, there just aren't a lot of inherent storytelling possibilities in the material.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Cinepix Film Properties",

Actually in this case I don't mind spoiling, as it might save you more time to spend with loved ones than watching this crud \u2013 they introduce some dominatrix male in a suit who controls everything for whatever dumb reason. I believe this was to lead into a part 5 that (THANK GOD) never happened, much like the open ended plot holes that happened in both at the end of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and Aliens Vs. Predators.As much as I was angry at life after Texas Chainsaw 2 and 3, I think I just gave up during this viewing. Sure, as bad as the predecessor sequels were, this takes the absolute cake in horrible film making. It has wretched acting, intolerable dialogue and a pointless script.Despite the fact I wouldn't normally agree with actors attempting to halt film releases when they have already completed a film, I have to side, just for the extreme embarrassment defense, with both McConaughey and Zellweger's feeble attempts to stop Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation from being freed to the world. Unfortunately they lost. What kind of world do we live in when OJ (originally) walks and this movie is distributed. There is no justice after all.Does it go without saying: SKIP IT? * - Side Note: I did go out of order. I first rewatched TCM Remake, then the remake's prequel, followed by TCM 2, 3 and 4. I still have to go back to the absolute beginning to complete the series of reviews. I do pray they don't make any more.",

            "content": "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre starts late one night on 'May 22 1996' when Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer) spots her boyfriend Barry (Tyler Cone) kissing another girl, upset she gets into her car & begins to drive away but Barry manages to get in before she does. In the back seat are two of their friends Jenny (Renee Zellweger) & Sean (John Harrison), as they argue about various things they suddenly realise they are lost in some woods. Then out of nowhere a car hits them & they are forced off the road, Jenny, Heather & Barry head off to find help while Sean stays behind to look after the injured driver of the other car & before long a guy named Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) turns up in a wrecker. Unfortunately for Sean Vilmer is a psycho & kills him. Meanwhile Jenny, Heather & Barry find an isolated house where they are terrorised by the inhabitants including the chainsaw wielding retard Leatherface (Robert Jacks). Who will survive & what will be left of them...?Written, produced & directed by Kim Henkel & probably more commonly known under the title The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (maybe whoever retitled it was a Star Trek fan) this was the fourth Texas Chainsaw Massacre film & is easily the worst. The script at times copies exact scenes from the original in particular the scene when a girl is dragged screaming through a corridor & a bit when she is lifted up & impaled on a meat hook, the escape from the house felt very familiar & the final shot where Leatherface is swinging his chainsaw around in anger as the sole surviving teenage girl drives off into safety. Unfortunately The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an awful film in every way possible, the character's are clich\u00e9d & annoying, it's predictable, it's totally bloodless & devoid of any exploitation, it is punctuated with lame attempts at humour & there are some truly bizarre plot developments. How, for instance, can someone be driving through a dense city & then within what seems like 5 minutes suddenly become lost in some woods even though there seems to be plenty of roads around? How can these bunch of killers operate so openly? Who on Earth is that guy in the suit at the end who unbuttons his shirt to reveal his body is pierced with large rings?! Who was in the plane? Are we to assume the average crop spraying pilot would use the propeller on his plane to kill people? There are so many things wrong with this film, there are so many bad parts, stupid parts, annoying parts & it's a film without any balls whatsoever so no one even comes close to being killed with a chainsaw. This isn't a massacre for god's sake, I saw more blood when I cut myself shaving this morning.Director Henkel turns in a really crappy film, there are various continuity mistakes that you don't even have to look that closely to see & as a whole it has no style or visual quality. The comedy elements are out-of-place with scenes of Vilmers leg being operated by remote control! There is also the frankly embarrassing sight of seeing Leatherface dressed in drag, a wig & putting lipstick on! A truly hideous image & one that one just can't help but laugh at. There are no shocks, no horror, no gore whatsoever, we barely see a chainsaw & generally speaking I think The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre fails miserably at what it sets out to do.With a budget of $600,000 The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is pretty sloppy & poorly made throughout. The house interior is OK & adds a little atmosphere but not enough. What on Earth are McConaughey & Zellweger doing in this? I would imagine that the only reason The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is of any interest is because these two make early acting appearances, I trust they have since fired their agents & got better ones. To be fair to them I thought they both did OK considering the 3rd rate material they had to work with.The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is total crap, I can't really see why anybody would like it. The two previous sequels The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) & Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) are far superior so watch one of those again instead. According to the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section there was originally a longer cut that ran for 95 minutes rather than the one widely available which runs for about 86, I shudder at the very thought...",

McConaughey is terrific in the film and literally steals the show but I don't know if I'll ever look at him the same again! He goes looney tunes in this flick! Leatherface himself can be kind of a sissy in this one. In fact he does nothing but dress like women in this flick so I guess he is a sissy.It's pure chaos through and through and that's cool and all but it's over long and wears out it's welcome. The whole bit with the guy in the limo was really stupid I think. It seemed an attempt to bring something new to a film that is really nothing new. And the ending left me a bit confused.

Vilmer had become a silly boy, according to Rothman, because he had not frightened Jenny and had let her take control, unlike the way poor Sally Hardesty had been frightened out of her mind in the original. Rothman should have been directing his comments to Kim Henkel, for he is the one who had driven the franchise into this abomination. Alas, what worked well in Return of the Living Dead, the deft combination of horror and satire, falls so flat here that Columbus would sail off the edge. This miserable attempt makes all TCM fans cringe beyond all belief at the embarrassment afforded to that grand horror icon, Leatherface. The general plot outline could have worked in the hands of an able director, and does grant a few genuinely frightening moments near the beginning, and starts out promising. The chase on the rooftop is quite inspired, and Leatherface does seem foreboding early on, but most of that is lost with the ridiculous howling, and the later excessive transvestite behavior. In this regard, the one positive thing about this lame entry is that, by comparison, TCM part 2 is utterly superb and TCM part 3 is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a remake of sorts to the original cult classic. It tells the story of a group of teens who are stranded in the middle of nowhere after prom. Pretty soon they are being hunted down by a family of cannibals lead by a seemingly normal young woman. The dirty work is done by Vilmer, a sadist with one leg, and Leatherface, a cross-dressing chainsaw-wielding maniac. Please don't expect this terrible entry into the series to be serious. I think it's a prank to be honest.I don't understand how this series could go wrong. Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel created a horror movie legend with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Then Tobe Hooper came back for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and that was a disaster. The 3rd film had no one that was involved with the original involved. Now, original writer Kim Henkel returns to direct the 4th film in the series. He makes it a kind of reworking of the original, and all the while he spits on his original creation. All of the characters are stupid and dull, and you're rooting for Leatherface to kill them as soon as possible so the movie will end faster. Pretty soon, you're not even rooting for Leatherface anymore. Instead of being the chunky, terrifying, silent retard from the first film, he is an obese, noisy, clumsy retard that dresses like a woman all the time. The most ridiculous plot point is when it is revealed that the FBI knows Leatherface and his clan are still active, and they're allowing the killings to happen in a controlled environment.The acting is disgustingly poor. Not one performance in the movie is good. It is interesting to see two good and highly successful actors like Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger sucking so bad. It was actually kind of sad too.Overall, everybody should just ignore the fact that this movie even exists. Matthew McConaughey was in Angels in the Outfield in 1994 and moved on to Boys on the Side in 1995. Renee Zellweger was in Love and a .45 and moved onto Empire Records. Remember that.1/10",

Not even Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey could save this one.The problems I have with this film are that there is practically no plot, and what what little plot there may be is stolen outright from the original film.

Matthew who is playing the hitchhiker role from the first one is the main attraction and it just doesn't equal all that much terror this time around.

It has Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, but that doesn't even help this movie at all. Matthew McConaughey is usually good at playing psychotic southern maniac so he fit right into his role with this one. Seriously, how many psychotic relatives does the creepy grandpa have anyways? Maybe I am missing something, but didn't that creepy old guy die in the third one? They even made Leatherface a pizza eating transvestite...Seriously. I am not sure, if they intentionally made this movie bad, but it's downright bad. I give this movie a 2.3 because although it's in the awful category I was able to sit through it without having that huge urge to just leave. But that really isn't saying much. The acting in a lot of parts is just laughably bad, like they were intentionally not trying. It doesn't even have the entertainment value to sit with a group of friends and just roast it.

The first half of the movie has an effectively creepy look about it And it does have a good balance of humour and horror for much of its course. Sadly though there are several things that let it down. Badly. For a start the Sawyer family here are the worst in the franchise. That's not to say that it is down to bad acting, rather the characters are just poor in comparison. Cross dressing Leatherface looks creepy but not so much threatening. Vilmer is too over the top, and W.E. is constantly spouting famous quotes, which rapidly becomes rather tiresome. Darla, the sole female member, was my favourite loony. There is a minor sub plot about an educated guy in a suit, something to do with a secret society but totally pointless. The first half of the film is quite good but I felt that it just fell apart during the second, and was quite relieved to see the end credits.

I stepped into a little, obscure Video Center and in order to watch \"TCM The Next Generation\" I had to become a member. The attendant didn't want to sell it. Anyways, the box cover is really weird. A tranvestie Leatherface stands holding a chainsaw between the faces of McConaughey and Zellweger. (I scanned the image in case someone wants it). I must say that I'm very disappointed of this sequel especially because Kim Henkel wrote and directed it. I had mixed feelings after watching the movie. At first I thought it's a decent mid 90's slasher flick with a confusing story. Then I thought about it as a 90's version of the events of the original TCM. Then I thought about it as a mediocre attempt to remake the original and adding 90's horror movies elements. Then I was like \"what a f***ed up movie!\". Then I put my ideas together and I reached the conclusion that this is a bizarre horror movie. Not bizarre like TCM 2 which was fun and gory. It's bizarre in a bad way because it makes no sense, the dialogue is awful, the characters are cartoonish, the events are stupid, the script goes nowhere, there aren't explanations to important events, etc. The first half an hour is quite good for an early 90's slasher flick. There's a little suspense and some weird moments. The first half of the movie is a re-make of the events of the original. We get the hammer in the head, the girl hanging from the hook, Leatherface's crisis, Leatherface chasing Jenny, the hitch hiker routine, Jenny asking for help to just be driven to the house, etc. I must say that these scenes are actually well done. Specially the rooftop sequence. It looks really creepy when Leatherface comes out from the window and chases Jenny in the rooftop. It's always nice to watch these scenes mainly because they're great moments in the original TCM. After these scenes; the movie goes abruptly downhill. The second half of the movie is a disaster. What the hell does the FBI has to do with the Sawyers?! What's with the \"mission to make people feel horror\" line?! The clan are cannibals! Why would someone mess with the original story and add FBI and aliens? The \"torture\" that Jenny goes through is not even 5% what Marylin Burns went through. THINGS TO SAVE ABOUT THE MOVIE. -The hammer in the head kill. -The hanging in the hook scene. Always works. -Leatherface's first appearance. -The rooftop chasing sequence. -Rene\u00e8s performance. She's very hot! -McConaughey's psycho performance is pretty good. -The pre Scream scenes. -The cameos of Marylin Burns and Paul A. Partian. -Darla's breasts and her sexiness.THE NEXT GENERATION is a mess. Fans like me are insulted and feel betrayed by Henkel. Watching a tranvestie Leatherface imitating the chainsaw \"dance\" is pathetic and hurts deep feelings. There's no gore or violence like in the previous TCM movies. The direction is in the caliber of a direct to video slasher, please. The soundtrack is lame! Horrible punk pop tracks. The dialogue is a disaster!

Some of the characters in this film are so cheesy, you would just laugh. For instance, one family member from Leatherface's family has a ROBOTIC LEG, that is so stupid, that kind of material doesn't belong in  Massacre film. Like I said, the acting was below normal.

The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre seems to think it's a clever dark comedy, but it's actually just an exercise in pure tedium and homage that goes on for far too long.We should have been warned within the first 10 minutes once we meet what passes as our characters and they're as boring and unrealistic as any teen slasher film I've ever seen. One girl won't shut up about her philandering boyfriend and constantly tries to pull a Scream and talk about how many bad decisions they're making and how they'd be dead if this was a horror film. Our heroine is blatantly obvious, because they make fun of her glasses and her virginity (and because she's played by future Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger).The rest feels like a scene by scene homage to the original film. Girl runs through woods from Leatherface, finds shelter and realizes that person is in on it as well, returns back to the house, jumps through a window, etc. It's all accounted for.

So I expected this movie to be at least half as good as the first one, but sadly it is just a bad movie.Henkel remade some scenes from the original movie, but did none of them any better. All the good bits from this movie were already done better in the first movie. The absence of blood maybe satisfied the BBFC and the MPAA, but was a real slap in the face for the fans of the first movie. Why would anyone want to see this blood-free movie when the gorey and bloody original movie is available? A sequel must break new ground to justify its existence, not paddle backward.The most outrageous thing that really p****d me off was the fact that in this movie there is NO chainsaw massacre. The bodycount is very low and no one is either killed or wounded by a chainsaw.\nThe previous movies in the series were really bloody and inventive, and therefore shocking. This movie is like Chainsaw-light or \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for dummies\". A real shame.\nEven good actors like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey can't save this movie. Zellweger's performance felt fake as hell and McConaughey's psycho also seemed fake and over the top.Yet another problem is the lack of realism. Zellweger's character jumps from panicky mode to action hero mode to can't-really-act-scared mode. McConaughey's character cuts himself with his knife, but doesn't seem to bleed at all except for a thin strip of blood.All in all, you can watch this movie. If you are a big fan of the series you will feel compelled to. Just don't do the mistake I did and buy it. It is simply a bad bad movie.",

At the very least, it would be the best of both worlds of gore and human deviants mated perfectly with the X-Files that was popular around this time. It could almost work.Sadly, Henkel seemingly has never made a film before.All of these elements are thrown into the mix willy-nilly which give it the luster of a book report written a few hours before the class and without any knowledge of the book included within it. We get a solid unintelligible mish-mash of convenient plot twists and bad acting that can only be defined as utterly pathetic. It's impossible to say if this was the fault of a difficult shoot, a badly written script, or a horrible directorial job, but all it adds up to is failure. The secondary title of \"The Next Generation\" just adds another dose of hilarity to the mix as it definitely refers to the famous Star Trek show and adds more hilarity, given the out-of-the-blue aspect of the Illuminati that seems tossed in their, a red sock amidst the white wash.All and all, you can see where this could have been made into something different in several spots but is let down by incompetence on every conceivable level. In a way, it tries to be Halloween 3 and Halloween 6 and ends up being too much like them to the point of failure.

Other than that, the only other things I really enjoyed was the house itself because I found it very creepy, and also a more transvestite-like Leatherface, which was an interesting take.Aside from these few small things, this film was awful. Particularly their attempt to make the Sawyers into some sort of conspirators in a weird project that is supposed to be \"spiritual\", as the random Agent Rothman tells the surviving girl; this reeked of something half-baked that the writers came up with as an idea they thought was interesting, but only falls flat, as there's too much vagueness surrounding this random Agent Rothman, and what exactly the Sawyers were doing for him. For me, it felt like an infringement of science fiction into what is by all other accounts a pure horror film, and it really, really made it even worse than it was. This gets a 2 out of 10 stars.

Kim Henkel, who co-wrote the original TCM returns to write & direct this remake/sequel. Just like TCM 3, this one makes no effort to include events of the previous movie into it's story (except for a very brief mention in the introduction). Four teens get in an offroad accident after the prom and find themselves being hunted by Leatherface, and yet another horde of new family members. The movie moves at a nice speed and the plot takes many predictable turns and characters do extremely dumb things (i.e. a girl is locked in a trunk; driver pulls over at crowded fast-food area. Instead of screaming for help to the dozens of people around, she calmly pleads with her kidnapper \"I'll be quiet if you poke me an airhole\"). Renee Zellweger stars as the mousy heroine (you know the cliche, ugly duckling until she lets her hair down and takes off her glasses) and Matthew McConaughey plays Vilmer, the handicapped leader of the family, whose intents don't appear to be of cannibalistic nature. The movie wasn't released until 1997, three years after production wrapped up -- due to the rising popularity of both of the leads at the time, and it's easy to see why the movie was held back and why a lot of people fought to stop it from being released. Sure, it serves as entertaining horror cheese, but the ending and the complete lack of gore, scares, excitement and logic completely flattens the experience. Kim Henkel should have been able to do better. The recent TCM remake is far superior and just embarrasses this farce.

Even the insert has a model who looks very different to the Leatherface actor from the film, in a completely different mask and outfit -- what's the story there? We don't care.Ultimately the film is a disaster from beginning to end, in more ways than one.

The rest of the cast are so amazingly disposable and useless that they never manage anything but taking up scenery; not a single character sticks in the mind in a positive or sympathetic way (the aforementioned included), but worst of all is Matthew McConaughey's annoying and incoherent role. Every moment he's on the screen is another moment of grating repulsion at the fact that his performance is so terrible. It's even more tragic when one realises that he's not a bad actor, it's just that he's not trying...not that most people would, given the abysmal script and lacking direction.The film tries to be eerie at times or disturbing, and it fails outright. Unfortunately more's the pity, since it also completely fails to provide any special effects whatsoever, gore or otherwise. This leads to its most inexcusable affront, and that is the fact that the film is extremely dull and uninteresting. It's not tense or frightening, it's not disturbing or scary, and it's not as thought-provoking as one feels it wanted to be. It's certainly not witty enough to coax forth any laughs, unless you're marvelling at shot of the window that didn't quite break away, which they for some reason left in despite the very next shot being the same window successfully doing so. It's just dull, and there is no excuse for a horror franchise sequel, no matter how far into the series one goes, to be dull. But this one fails on so many levels that it should be a benchmark for what not to do in a sequel.The previous three films in the series each brought something new and different to the story, and although there were good and bad in each, they could ultimately stand with reasonable independent merit. Not so with this one, which relies on the franchise name and iconic character (who incidentally accomplishes absolutely nothing new) to carry it. It's easy to see that there were some good ideas in the writing process of this script, it's just that none of them were developed adequately, and not a single good one made it to what they thought would be a good final revision. This script should have never made it to screen.There are some moments of promise, like the dinner scene, which rapidly go absolutely nowhere. There are setups that do nothing, and ultimately it becomes more frustrating than boring after the tenth or so situation set up and then left with no resolution. This was especially shameful in light of the fact that Zellweger and Perensky had such screen presence and obvious talent -- and we know McConaughey has talent, but you wouldn't know it to watch him here -- but the poor excuse for a script did absolutely nothing with their characters. The direction was also all over the place, and it seemed almost as if the first part of the film were an entirely different piece than the last.It all ends up in an unfulfilling and frankly asinine mess. The ending feels like it had been hastily typed out the day before filming was to finish, and acted out hurriedly, to wrap the film. It gives the impression that they couldn't afford to pay Zellweger for further lines, and it's completely contradictory with her character up to then. Nothing is resolved, nothing is fulfilled, and most damning of all, absolutely nothing is accomplished. This film is an exercise in the most flagrant type of ego masturbation that I have seen in a while, but it's so aimless that one finds it impossible to tell exactly whose ego is being stroked.Certainly not the viewer's, unfortunately. This is a film that crops up at Halloween season, when stores are wanting to sell cheap videos to people picking them up for parties and so forth. This might be a fun once-through when you're so drunk you don't know where you are, but for people watching it even for mild amusement...look elsewhere. This doesn't even manage to give that much.",

It isn't long until they find out they are being toyed with by a degenerate, crazy family with cannibalistic roots and chainsaw wielding tendencies. When first viewing TCM: The Next Generation with no prior knowledge of the film, it's hard to believe how bad the movie would end up being. It's obvious when watching the opening five minutes that the film worked with an extremely low budget for a big-named sequel and a first time director. The film is filled with pointless dialogue and head-scratching scenes that don't belong at any point. There isn't any chainsaw related deaths and very few chainsaw scenes in general. Not to mention, they made Leatherface into an unlikable sissy figure from the traditional menacing maniac that he should be. The film isn't completely trash though because there are a few times that are pretty laughable, and it can be entertaining to watch on the standpoint of it being a really bad movie. If the viewer can get past the terrible acting and writing, then give Next Generation a shot. Especially, if the viewer is a fan of Matthew McConaughey or Renee Zellweger, being Next Generation is one of their first films and they are the stars of the movie. It really isn't necessary to search out this film after watching the original trilogy and looking to move on to the newer modern day Texas Chainsaw films. Yes, Next Generation is that bad",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of horror. I'm the sort of viewer that tracks down obscure movies that most people have never heard about before. In all of my travels through the world of horror, my absolute favorite film still remains THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. So, it is with some embarrassment that I admit I am also a big fan of the sequels. As a horror fan, you have to generally accept that sequels are rarely good and never match up to the original. The further into a series you get, the lower the quality generally continues to drop. Generally, these movies can make up for it somewhat by upping the body count or going way over the top in the plot lines.I say all of this to acknowledge that I love the Chainsaw series. I own this movie on DVD. I know that horror sequels are usually bad. Yet, this movie is REALLY BAD. I mean, it makes other horror sequels look good in comparison. There is really nothing redeeming about this movie that I can even say, it's bad but..No, it's just bad.We can start with the obvious horror fan complaint that the body count is pretty low in this movie and what deaths we do see on screen are low-key, boring and not inventive at all. There is very little gore, no atmosphere and no real scares to be had. The original is actually pretty low on gore, as well, but viewers hardly noticed because of the terrifying atmosphere established by director Tobe Hooper. Without that atmosphere to lean back on, a movie like this usually has to give the audience something else, but sadly fails to do that.The movie can't decide if it's a sequel or a remake, so goes for some mixed up combination of the two. It remakes many of the iconic scenes of the original (the hook in the back, the window escape, the dinner party) but these are such pale imitations that it just makes the movie look even worse in comparison. The biggest factor in this is that the characters are just awful. I'm not speaking of the acting necessarily, but they're just never given anything to do. Renee Zellwegger is the greatest example of this. She might be the worst final girl in the history of horror. Not really because Zellwegger fails to act up to the part, but because the part is so horribly written. There is no real background given to her, no character development, no emotion almost at all. She is simply a plot contrivance for things to happen to and around, but never really feels like an involved part of anything.The one solid thing about this is McConaughey who plays the only character that's worth of the TCM family. Yet even this character becomes a joke in the end as we have the ridiculous plot device of him having a bio-mechanical leg constructed from old wires and a vacuum cleaner that is, for some reason, controlled by old television remotes. Yes, a sinister organization would replace a leg yet make it controllable by generic remotes. There is no biological reasoning for this. It serves only as a stupid plot tool so that several characters can control him using one of the multitude of handy extra remotes lying around the home.We won't even get started on the ludicrous Illuminati plot. It's so bad, I think writer Kim Henkel was actually trying to make it bad. It's almost like the rights would revert back to someone if they could make a sequel that was so horrible it would sink the franchise forever.I still watch this every few years when I go through an inevitable TCM marathon, but each time I'm a little more embarrassed that I own this on DVD. It's really just plain awful.",

Just one of the worst movies I've ever seen in general, and this is coming from someone who has sat through godawful crap like 8 Heads In a Duffel Bag, Mafia, The Men's Club, and many more. I went to rent 3 movies the other day, I picked Videodrome, Drugstore Cowboy, then went momentarily insane and picked this. I should have quit while I was ahead. No, I should have taken the rental money, bought a bumch of nails, and spent 90 minutes pounding them into my skull instead, as it would have been far more pleasant, soothing, and less painful. I saw TCM 1, 2, and 3. It would be insulting to even begin to compare the original with this, so I'm not gonna try (though the main survivor in that, the woman who gets away in the last scene, has an unbilled cameo in this). TCM 2 was great. TCM 3 was lame but this made it look like Goodfellas in comparison! The \"plot\" involves 2 couples on prom night who run into Leatherface and his family. Why was it so bad? Well, let's see. 1. Leatherface and other villians simply wander casually into camera range to make their entrance with no pretense at any kind of suspense or buildup. 2. Extraordinarily bad acting, even for a B-horror flick, even from Renee Zellweger and McConaughey.  3. They must have spent their entire FX budget on a shot of a rotting corpse in a bathtub, because there is NO gore at all, not even blood, even when someone gets hit in the head with an axe. There's a scene where M Mc M runs over some kid--after he's been chasing him in his tow truck, and the dumb kid just runs ahead of him the whole time, like in a road-runner cartoon, when he could have easily gone into the woods and escaped--and all you see is a shot of McM sitting in the cab of the truck, backing over him and going \"yeeehaw!\" about 20 times. No body, no nothing. Not even a sound when he runs over him. 4. victims are unusually stupid, even for a horror movie. Yeah, I know they're supposed to do stupid stuff and end up getting killed, but this went so far I wanted to slap the screenwriter (if there was one--most of it seems improvised). Characters on the run from killers hide in houses to escape and DO NOT EVEN CLOSE THE D*MN DOOR. There's the obligatory TCM scene where the victim is forced to sit at the dinner table with the rest of the cannibalistic family while they torment her, but in this case she is not tied to the chair--all she had to do was get up and stroll out. It gets to the point where even a viewer with a speed-limit IQ would have their intelligence insulted by this. 5. Leatherface has been turned into a whining, wimpy cross-dresser who is scared of everyone else in his family. Those are just the reasons I can think of off the top of my head. In fact, I'm getting all worked up again over how amazingly idiotic and insulting this movie was just writing about it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Do not pay to rent this movie. Do not even sit through this movie if someone pays YOU to watch it. And this isn't one of those 'so bad it's good' movies that are fun to laugh at, either. Don't rent it just to see how bad it is--if you do, you'll hate yourself after sitting through 3 minutes of it. Trust me on this, please.",

The role Matthew plays adds sick humor and pure 100% redneck attitude to a role that I am certain was lame on paper.   McConaughey actually out shines Leatherface in this one.  Well, that should not be too hard to understand considering Leatherface pulls a J. Edgar Hoover in the film by dressing up like a girl and squeeling a lot.   Watch the film for Matthew McConaughey's one man show.  If for any other reason you will be a bit jaded on this one.RETURN OF THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE:  \"6 crows dead out of a possible 10.\"",

I had been wary of this movie but I rented it. If I had seen this in the theater I would have burned it down and peed on the ashes. The only slightly amusing part deals with Toni Perenski's character Darla who adds a strong, modern woman touch to the often male dominated tribe of cannibals. Her character is like Dixie Carter on crack; a nice performance. Renee Zelwegger slept through her part, obviously bored with this unchallenging role of cannon fodder. Finally, Matthew McConaughey was frightening for a few seconds until he went back to yelling like some inbred goontard. And those two were decent compared to the rest of the cast. And you know what, I don't know their real names, I don't know their characters, and I don't care; you shouldn't either. They simply didn't matter. One person sticks out, though, at complete incompetence. Whoever played Leatherface was a screaming, shrieking moron in a Tim Curry/Dr. Frankenfurter suit. The actor should have had enough reverence to the original that he wouldn't rape Tobe Hooper's original vision as badly as he did. And the director, Kim Henkel, and Hooper are old pals. I would have smacked Henkel. And the plot, tried to go somewhere but didn't. The ending, tried to be cool, but wasn't. Simply a waste of time which actually sucked some of my precious life out of me.

I don't even know where to start with what is wrong with this flick at all, well I'll just say I didn't like the angle of why the family did what they did. Hint: they're not a cannibalistic group like the rest of the series portrays them, and I can't even believe they chose to go down that path! And Leatherface is a total wussy in this film. So sad they let the face of the franchise do so little to nothing at all in this movie. The major thing about this film is it being the debut of Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger. You do notice that most of the major stars today seemed to do their big debuts in horror movies a lot, but this movie is the stain of their careers. I'd be so embarrassed if I were them. I admire Matthew as an actor, but he just overacts too much in this movie and not the \"Overacting so much it's funny\" point either. I'd so watch How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days over this one any day.So if you ever plan a Texas Chainsaw movie marathon, please forget this movie. Like I said, it's the black sheep of the franchise.

Now I will admit that I didn't rate 1,2,or 3 on my top 10 list of favorite movies in the first place, but this movie was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen.  I've seen some pretty bad movies (say, Gods and Monsters?) but this beats all.  First, there is no plot.  I sat there the entire time wondering what in the hell the point of the movie was.  In the original (the second and third as well), you understood why these people were running around slaughtering people with chainsaws.  The crazy family, though REALLY crazy, made sense.  This installment failed to let the viewers in on this little secret.  So I sat for 2 hours and still have no idea why the freaks in the woods were freaks in the woods, nor do I understand what in the hell Matthew McConnehey was supposed to be and he was the main character. Second, what in god's name happened to Leatherface?  That's not Leatherface - I don't know what the hell he was either.  The original made your skin crawl-he was creepy, disgusting and a helluva lot scarier than some freak transvestite who does nothing more than scream like a little girl.  And what's with the Warren act from \"There's Something About Mary\"?  And finally, where was the ending?  I must have missed something because all I saw for an ending was Zellweger in the limo with that weirdo (who or what he was supposed to be is also extremely and irritatingly elusive) and that thing that was supposed to be Leatherface spinning around with a chainsaw. Then she's all the sudden at the hospital staring at this bloody chick that wasn't even in the movie, as though she had something to do with any of it. But I feel the worst insult to the TCM movie series was the fact that the \"C\" and \"M\" were completely missing from the movie.  You cannot name a movie Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE if there is NO CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  Not a damn person was killed by a chainsaw, nor was there any kind of bloody massacre like that nastiness in the second one with all the bloody hacked up body parts falling out of the wall or Leatherface putting L.J.'s face on Stretch's face.  The only blood I saw came from Vilmer, and that was a sorry disappointment.To sum this up, if you have any regard at all to the orginal Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, or any regard for the film industry whatsoever, bypass this wretched movie.  And if somehow you end up being held hostage and forced at gun point to watch this movie, I recommend telling them to pull the trigger. Seriously.",

Fourthly, the events in the film are either completely random or don't make sense, usually its both. For example, a girl will be placed on a meat hook\u0085she's then seen crawling across a road? What?! And towards the end (A SPOILER FOLLOWS\u0085), Vilmer gets hit for no apparent reason by a random plane, that springs out of nowhere! I don't quite understand what Henkel trying to do with this one, but he's failed miserably. One thing's for sure however, he defiantly wasn't sober when writing or directing this. If he was sober, then he must have dropped the full copy of the script on the way to the studio, picked the pages back up, and then put them in a random order\u0085that's what this film feels like. However, despite what a terrible terrible mess the film is, it's amazingly not all bad. The black humour does work well, and some of the characters are entertaining to watch. Leatherface, despite being far too whiny than menacing, personality wise he's far closer to the original Leatherface's persona than in any other sequel. However, despite these positives, the film is far outnumbered in negatives; it isn't a good sequel, but at least it's to an extent entertaining, unlike Chainsaw 3 which is just boring.Kim Henkel said he wanted to bring the series back to the \"spirit of the original\", but the only spirit was the one he was drinking before he began writing the script. Watchable for the casual audience, but if your fan of the series you'll be very disappointed.",

To say its bad would be a gross understatement, and to say its funny in even a bad, campy way would be an outright lie. So lets see... Fans who saw part 3 will understand this: Tex=Vilmer. I cant say I think much of Matthew McConaughey, but he did at least outdo Viggo Mortensen from part 3 in stinking up the film. In fact the Film should have been called \"Vilmer\", since afterall the most integral character of the whole series Leatherface is now a cowering drag queen that sits in only as a comic foil. Did also mention he looks like a horrific combo of Rosie O'Donnel and Roseanne Barr??? That alone should be reason enough to stay far away from this atrocity! Ren\u00e9e Zellweger may be cute, but she sure cant play a scream queen... in some scenes you can actually see her giggling aloud at the pathetic situations she is placed in! The Family is in no way comparable to even the pathetic one from part 3, in fact they are so laughable you might think this is a local film school getting their first taste of being shot on film. Lastly, where the hell is the CHAINSAW MASSACRE the film so portrays in its title? I mean not one death was result of its namesake...\nGod, now I feel cheap that I even reviewed this drivel.

Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so unprecedented in it's poorness, that it doesn't even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick.  Let me reiterate.  The filmmakers actually FAILED at the least complicated genre in the book.  If I wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere I would have rented \"Week End\".RotTCM should have gotten a 1.  In fact I felt like I was disappointing moviegoers everywhere when I gave it a 2, but the extra point is the ever crafty curiosity value.  Yes, you will be compelled to watch, if only to observe some clue as to why both Matthew McConaughey (pre-\"A Time to Kill\") and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (pre-\"Jerry Maguire\") accepted the lead roles (the clue never comes).

            "content": "I've seen very few TCM films that were good. This is actually the first one I ever saw, though, as the choice film for a Halloween party many years ago, randomly picked by a gaggle of middle-school girls. Because of this I tend to compare; I'll watch and dislike another TCM and go \"Hm. The Next Generation was funnier\". Which is really one of the only defenses it has.I'm not even completely certain this film takes place IN Texas like the other ones. The locale is obviously different (while there are some wooded areas in the original, location has always been key, and this place doesn't resemble the original in any way, shape or form; I would actually place this film further northeast).Rewatching it several times and paying close attention, it seems to me that rather than this be the same family (or even one or two members of the returning family, plus some new ones), it's an entirely new one, in a different place. There's no real proof that these people show cannibalistic tendencies like in the first ones (the only thing you see them eat in this movie is pizza. And as the latest film, The Beginning, would suggest, they have alternative sources of food which the originals did not have.) The most I could make out of the conspiracy bit was that someone found a decent smattering of weirdos, threw them in a house together, and basically set this whole situation up to be a copycat of the old 70s murders -- more or less to keep the legend alive. (This is further validated by the fact that when the \"leader\" of this charade, after saving Zellweger's character and driving off with her, offers to drop her off at either a hospital or a police station, encouraging her to pass the word along.) With this in mind, I have no qualms with Leatherface showing up in a dress. Why? Because it's obviously not the same one.With that out of the way, seeing this and knowing who figures like Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey are really adds this almost surreal quality to the whole experience. McGonaughey (Vilmer) is positively terrifying at times, and considering his lightning-fast mood-swings, and his constant and aimless acts of violence (even against himself), one has to wonder just what it is that he suffers from mentally. This attitude is likely what got him picked as the leader of this group to begin with, however.Zellweger (Jenny) is almost unrecognizable at the beginning of this film, and the transformation that is attempted for her character almost works. Almost. If there'd been more background given to her, the change from shy geek to toughened victim of circumstance (a transformation that is key in most survival films) would have flown more believably. I have to say I always laugh at loud, though, when she announces she's leaving, and that nobody follows her. Leatherface starts to scream and fly into a rage, to which she responds \"And YOU sit the **** back down!\" ...And it works.Funniest horror movie moment, EVER.Short of Darla, Vilmer's girlfriend, all women in this film appear to have a serious problem with running upstairs when they should be going out the door. Zellweger does this twice, in fact. The other main female in the film, Heather, seems to be played up as a parody of all dumb bimbo chicks in movies. She is rude, whiny, badly acted, and constantly talking like she's psychic, but it's played with all the panache of a petulant five year-old.All in all, watch it for the laughs, and to see what Zellweger and McConaughey were doing in their early years.",

The only reason I bump it up from a 1 is the fun of seeing Matthew McConaughey torture Renee Zellwegger for an hour. Matthew's charismatic presence is the only thing this movie has going for it, though I found his girlfriend rather attractive and interesting in her routine acceptance of this family as being normal. There is some overlap with the original but that 1974 film was very frightening because of its low-budget documentary style (was it black and white?, I can't remember). I didn't see any reference to cannibalism in this one; they eat pizza here.One continuity glitch: In a homage to the original, a female character is hung up on a meathook alive and we hear the hook go into her back. However, 20 minutes later she is still alive and lying on her stomach in the road and we see that the skin on her back has no marks or insertion points at all.

About a month later I bought the special edition LD of the original one.  On it I saw a trailer for Return of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and thought that it had looked pretty cool.  At this point I knew that the movie had in fact been made.  I got my hands on a Japanese LD catalog and found it for sale in there.  I bought it immediatly.  When it arrived in the mail I was so happy.  I sat down and started to watch. When I was done I realized why the movie hadn't been released in the theaters or on video.  The movie was pure garbage.  The acting was terrible and the story was just a total ripoff of the original.  A few years later It got released in the theaters after the Rene Zelweger's success in Jerry Maguire. A bunch of my friends wanted to go see it in the theater.  I told them to save their money and gave a little show at my house.  They agreed with me as did most of the people who saw this movie.  It's terrible.",

Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse they made 'The return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.  This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. The acting (from then unknown Matthew McConaghy and Renee Zellweger) is appalling and the whole film feels as if its missing about 20 mins of plot. This movie was definitely sold on its title.  One to watch if only for the fact that it's so bad. Oh yeah, its not even violent but it still banned in Britain (along with the rest of them).",

The first Massacre, Leatherface was INTIMIDATING. He could scare without the chainsaw and he growled, moaned and roared, not squeaked like a little p****. The rest of the story was.... what am I saying there was no story. There was some semblance of a story. Here, it's just using the name to get people into theaters and parting fools and their money.

But there are a few occasions where I cannot simply use another word, or expect anyone to use a different word. \"Pointless\" accurately describes this movie, even knowing that a horrors/thrillers are not known because of their character development or inappropriately elaborate plot lines. The main problem is that the \"Chainsaw Massacre\" does not really have a plot, save the intro, up to the point we can see the first killing.I must admit that I have not yet seen the first movie, or any of its predecessors, but after seeing this, I started to become curious how they could be. I know that sequels are not superior to its prequels, at least in the eyes of the reviewers. Seeing that the first movie got far better rating than this one, I look forward to seeing them, or any.As for this film, I do not intend to give a brief outline of the plot, as some of my fellow reviewers have done so. The story started out relatively well, mainly because of the dialog in the car, but it continuously became worse as the movie progressed. When the fat man with started chasing the poor girl with the chainsaw, I was hoping that at least there would be something that boosts my morale in this movie. But no, not a single one was killed in a downright bloody and brutal way, I exaggerate if I say that either of the killings was any good. Yes, either, because only two of the four protagonists die in the movie, plus one antagonist gets chopped by the propeller of an aircraft. That was the best part in the film. (How the aircraft came into the view and why remains a mystery) Frankly, I was expecting more from this movie. I expected much gore and got little. The skulls, skeletons, and other corpses improve a bit on the overview. Not if these were elements which are unique for a narrow range of horror movies, or how they are displayed/placed were any special.",

It should be an obvious sign that this movie stinks if Gunnar Hansen didn't want to reprise his role as good ol' Leatherface. Who can blame the guy, though? The script must've mortified him! To top it all off, the amount of people who die can be counted on one hand. When I watch a horror movie, I want to see massacres of immense proportion, not a measly three or four murders.

This thing is very cheap and does no respect to the excellent original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This movie is truly horrible! The main point(if there is one)of this movie is about some high school teens that conveniently get lost on some back roads after leaving the prom and then crash into another car while driving in the night. From there it goes all down hill as the teens stumble onto the house inhabited by the chainsaw family and are chased and beaten and stabbed but still manage to mumble their meaningless lines as the movie drags on for over an hour and a half. The plot then takes a  turn from bad to horrible as we find out that the United States government is running tests on fear and using the family to do the dirty work.

(But the sound of his \"fake\" leg got really annoying after awhile.)This movie basically had two highlights: the fact that it ended, and the fact that it was less than 90 minutes long. I assume it was supposed to be some sort of a slasher flick, but it missed the mark in that there were no good death scenes. Are people dead? Well, we THINK they are. We never actually see them die. This movie has the look of cheap, low-budget rent-a-flick, over-flowing with what were, at that time, low-paid, inexperienced, no-name-brand actors. In fact, a few haven't been in anything SINCE 1994.Could this have been a good movie? Maybe, depending on your personal tastes. I'm not a huge fan of cannibalism, cheap theatrics, or over-done routines. About the only decent thing about the movie was the acting. I may have hated the characters, but Perensky and McConaughey were fabulous in those roles. I'm not even going to go INTO my complaints about Leatherface.

I can however say that the man Leatherface was originally based on, the \"True Story\", was Ed Gein, a serial killer who wore a mask of human flesh and killed women at his remote home. The characters of Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill (Silence of The Lambs) were both also based on him and were, by all accounts, more accurate. Ed Gein also wore a suit of human flesh, including breasts, in an attempt to be more female, which accounts for Leatherface wearing a dress in this film. However, a lot more characterization should have been put into explaining this. For the record, Ed Gein worked alone, no family members helping him and certainly no grand family traditions of cannibalism, and the only two bodies ever found were killed with a pistol; no evidence ever pointed to him using a chainsaw on any of his victims. He was just another Jeffrey Dahmer-esq serial killer with a highly dysfunctional sense of eroticism.",

I am sure those involved in spawning this movie intended it as camp but anyone with a modicum of creative ability knows you cannot ever intend something as camp. Campiness lies in the fact that the creators took their own work seriously and it just ended up badly. If they don't take it seriously and try to make something \"so bad it's good,\" the word for this is not \"camp.\" Terms like \"pointless\" or \"insulting\" are more apt. And no, I cannot bring myself to say Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaghey \"did the best they could\" or \"their stardom shines through\" or whatever meaningless tripe I am supposed to say about well-known actors who star in trash like this. McConaghey probably intended to be an over-the-top psycho but he just came off as unbelievably irritating and his skills were about as subtle (and painful) as being bashed repeatedly with an I-beam.Zellweger phoned in her performance while sleepwalking and her skills are so pathetic that she cannot even convey emotion upon learning her prom date has been run over by a tow truck.\nThe only way I would ever watch this movie again is if it were one of the ransom demands made by the person who kidnapped one of my family members.",

Leatherface, why oh why did you have to do this to me.  First this movie, then the pathetic remake which was more of a 90's slasher throwback than anything that happened in the original.  I wish somebody in Hollywood would grow a pair and make a true remake of the original.  Get Tobe Hooper to direct it and focus on resurrecting the story, not making it like a big homage to Scream.\nAt least the TCM 2 had a different storyline than try to rehash the same plot with a few minor changes.  I hate you Kim Henkel, you are filth, excrement, and waste all wrapped into one big intoxicating piece of garbage. How dare you try to pass off this terrible movie as a TCM movie.",

Everything about this film is awful. Its just bad. Totally B- quality acting. No Plot. Doesn't stay faithful to the story. Its just bad! I would have to say that I have loved all the films installment...1, 2, 3, and um, NOT part 4!! No...Part 5 (YES!!!!) Jesseca Beil kicked but!! Part 4? Well...Renee was OK...but the fact that she existed at all in such a mess of Mannequin proportion....makes her kinda negative cool, as well!! Matthew Mcaughney? He was good!! But still...he was amongst such horrible co-stars...that he, himself has managed to self destruct! You see....no matter how good the actor...if he's believing and going along with something so unbelievably bad (the plot, acting ability, just everything) Then he becomes part of that disaster...I give this film a 1...it gets 1 only because I have a soft spot in my heart for crappy b-films...I love em all...so I give this something...not too much but something. But its one of the not so desirable....Watch if you will...its the only way you'll know for yourself!.. C, 'Ya",

I was looking through my local video store and I saw \"Chainsaw IV\". From the look at the names who stared in it, I thought this had to be an awesome movie. I mean the chick from \"Jerry Mcguire\" and the guy who stared in \"Reign of Fire\". What could go wrong? I bought the movie right then and took it home(big mistake). I was so embarrassed for the makers of this movie. How in the world did this film make it to the light of day. What studio executive green lighted the release of this film? When did they sit down and actually say \"this is a good movie let's let people watch it.\" There was no \"best part\" in the movie. Not even went it was over did I feel good. I knew that I could never get that time it took to watch the movie back. Please do not watch this movie. I beg you. If you see this movie at a store, hide it, so no one will have to watch it.",

The first TCSM(how it was really spelt, but it seems you forgot that here) was probably one of the best horror movies ever made, right up there with psycho, but this \"horror\" movie is lucky to compare with a film that was overexposed, and then overexposed again. Tell me this Mr. Henkel, why would the Illuminati(the group that Rothman was a member of) care about some psycho family in Texas? Oh yeah, that's right, because it is a RIDICULOUS concept!  Why you put that plot element in there to further add to this attrocity is beyond me. And what was the deal with \"Leatherface\"?  Do you have some problem with Gunnar Hansen that you had to destroy the character he created so well? (Did anybody realize he looked just like Drew Cary's cross dressig brother?) In the opening credits of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, it says written by Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel.  I think we all know that Hooper wrote the script, and Henkel is credited because he dotted the \"i\"'s. Everyone, see the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre and try to avoid this, and try to forget about this disgrace!",

I also noticed that kim henkel produced, wrote and directed this film which he also played a big part in the making of the original tcm, id just like to know what the hell was going through his mind when he made this total piece of crap,, i could not believe what i was watching. This film is very very very bad,, i dont mind a cheesy horror film but this is just awful. avoid at all costs,, if your a tcm fan and want to see this disgracefull piece of garbage wait for it to come on tv ( which i doubt will ever happen ) or wait for a friend to buy it or something,, dont waste 1 pence on this,, tobe hooper should give kim a bit of a kicking for making this film, i would. my advice is STAY AWAY.",

            "content": "Hm, I have never been an UBER fan of this genre, the whole, chainsaw idea is scary to a point, but Chainsaws arent nearly as prime-evil as say, a machette. With that said, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre gives us a chilling look at possible humanity. Though, it twists the true tail of a man who just liked to skin dead bodies and a few living people for parts, it does give us a neat little genre to think about. Now, WITH THAT SAID. I can starb bashing this terrible movie. God man, a horror film should scare you, and disturb you a little. Not annoy you and disturb you none. This is just a bunch of cheap attempts to gross you out and make you laugh all piled up into one stinking bag of crap. The movie fails on every level and its dialogue is far past dated. The characters are stereo typical, and the acting is bleh. The antagonistic characters are so homely and freaking 'southernish' that any self respecting southerner would be offended. The movies constant state of POTENTIAL disturbance ruins it, really. It ends up being just long and annoying. It will drive you more batty then a really bad independant film that tries to be artful. The ignorance of the 'victim' characters is disgusting. When I watch a horror film, nothing annoys me more then a victim character that JUST WONT DIE. Its usually the 'anti-hero' of the film. But as anyone knows, Leatherface is kind of a wimp. He cries alot, whines, and is far from scary. Infact Id go as far to say that his family is more disturbing then he is. This movie fallows the same path as the others, where you keep a human character alive, bloody, beaten, half dead, just so they can die later on when they should have died hours ago! Its just a really bad flick that I think would annoy ANYONE!",

The 2 next sequels were bloody awful, and this one stinks more than a New York sewer inspector... Leatherface has become a F**kin DRAGQUEEN for Christsake!
