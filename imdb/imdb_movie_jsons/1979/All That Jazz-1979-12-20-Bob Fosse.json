            "content": "All that Jazz is a great film that almost seems to have dropped off the radar screen of classic musicals. The film gives us the account of a choreographer named Joe Gideon (Scheider) whose relentless way of living drives him straight into the grave. The character is based on the real life of director Bob Fosse who suffered the same fate in 1987. Gideon is a womanizing, drug abusing, perfectionist who begins each morning with the same routine. He pops a few pills, takes some Alka-Seltzer, jumps in the shower (sometimes with a cigarette in his mouth!), and declares it's \"showtime\" after giving himself one last look in the mirror. When we meet him, he's currently putting the finishing touches on a film he's just directed, and he's beginning work on a new Broadway musical. The man looks absolutely exhausted. He's always smoking. He seems on the brink of collapse from angina, and he frequently grasps his left arm apparently in an effort to determine if his heart is still beating or not.The main idea behind this film is that Gideon knows he's dying. The life he has lived has assured him only a brief stay on this earth. As the film plays out, we see how Gideon comes to grips with his impending fate. His final journey is often touching; sometimes joyful. But above all, it is compelling and once it's over, you'll probably wish Gideon had hung on longer. He seemed to have so much to live for. Even the people around him who he's hurt in life (his ex-wife and current girlfriend, for example) still are a big part of his life. He has a wonderful daughter who he's just getting to know, as well. Without him around, there would certainly be an enormous void left for all of the central characters in this film. We see him confess his life's sins to Jessica Lange who plays an angel waiting to usher him into the afterlife once he finally succumbs to his medical problems. The closer the two of them get, the closer he is to the grave.Fosse's direction is exceptional. His musical numbers (particularly Airotica) are top-drawer as you'd expect them to be. And he's never afraid to shock you with his camera-work. At one point we get an up-close and personal look at Gideon's heart surgery, and that's a bit grotesque for a musical. Remember this is the same director that showed us Dorothy Stratton's face getting blown off with a shotgun in Star 80.Fosse also understandably knows these characters better that they know themselves. By the end of the film, you really know Joe Gideon, and you feel like you've lived part of his life. Fosse saw the same fate coming to himself, and indeed it found him in 1987. We often wish exceptional individuals would stick around longer, but then again it's the way they live that makes them so exceptional.This film is highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

            "content": "A never less than fascinating, barely fictionalized biopic about legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse. The character in the movie is named Joe Gideon, but come on: he's in the middle of choreographing and directing a stage musical that looks an awful lot like \"Chicago,\" and he's in post-production on a film that looks an awful lot like \"Lenny.\" I think we all know who this movie is REALLY about.It's self indulgent to be sure, and a bit of a mess overall, but it's just so damned accomplished in every way that it's impossible not to sit back and enjoy the ride, however destructive that ride might be. And boy is it destructive. You're going to feel like you need to go on a rigorous exercise regimen and a system-cleansing diet after watching the Fosse stand-in in this film abuse himself to death. This movie will quickly disabuse you of any illusions about the glamour of the show business world.Roy Scheider gives the performance of his career as Joe Gideon. My other favorite performance came from Leland Palmer as Gideon's long-suffering ex-wife (and presumably Gwen Verdon stand in). These two make poignantly obvious what made them click in the first place while at the same time conveying perfectly why they can't live with one another. Ann Reinking plays Ann Reinking, one-time girlfriend to Fosse who does the same honors in the movie. And before anyone knew who she was, Jessica Lange played a very ravishing angel of death.\"All That Jazz\" isn't as tight or as powerful as Fosse's previous musical, \"Cabaret,\" but that's largely because it's so much more insular as a movie. It's really about the demons plaguing one man, and it doesn't have any broader context than that. Whether or not you like it will depend heavily on how fascinating you find the world of New York theatre, and how much you care about Joe Gideon in the first place. To his credit, Scheider is able to make Gideon an entirely sympathetic, if not entirely likable, character.And if there aren't any musical numbers to rival the razzle dazzle of the \"Mein Herr\" or \"Money, Money\" numbers from \"Cabaret,\" there are still a fair share of showstoppers in \"Jazz,\" notably a cute little duet for Reinking and the girl that plays Gideon's daughter, and the rousing opening number, in which a stage full of Broadway hopefuls audition for a show in a whirl of quick edits set to the song \"On Broadway.\" A fantastic, mesmerizing film.Grade: A",

            "content": "Bob Fosse's autobiographical look at the hectic life of a Broadway director/choreographer rehearsing a new show in New York City while concurrently editing his latest movie. Roy Scheider fabulously stands in for Fosse; as Joe Gideon, pill-popping, womanizing, self-destructive genius on the verge of collapse, it is Scheider's shining moment as an actor. Fosse paints himself as suspicious, paranoid, driven, indifferent, exhausted and horny. It's more than most of us want to know about the man, who seems intent on showing us what a creep he is...but a talented creep! The film doesn't particularly look good (it's a gray movie), though it has amazing musical flourishes and the self-styled bombast is actually rather amusing once you get the idea. Jessica Lange is beautiful in an early role as the Angel of Death (imagine Fosse explaining that role to her!), and Scheider's performance is really something to see (only occasionally does the camera catch him not knowing what to do). Fosse tries hard not to be pretentious, he keeps things playful and perky, and his ironic ending is bitterly funny. The film is alive and ticking--but that's not Fosse's heart, it's a time bomb. *** from ****",

            "content": "Read my review of \"Newsies\" if you want my opinion of the musical genre. People just don't break into song-and-dance numbers in the course of their daily lives. Unless they are Bob Fosse, when suddenly doing so not only makes sense, but makes you wonder how we can go through life NOT singing and dancing.What this movie is, is simple: Bob Fosse unveiling his life, his knowledge, and a detailed explanation of his creative process, for future generations to evolve. This film is part biography, part self-exploration, and part legacy. It is the \"legacy\" part that is overlooked by almost everyone. If you ever dreamed of becoming a choreographer, this is the ideal place to start, because you'll watch, over and over, as Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder as the fictionalized Fosse) puts his stamp on a dance number, a process so unique and brilliant that it could easily be classified as its own form of dance rather than a subset of modern dance. If three words could sum up Fosse's style of choreography it would be \"make it sexier.\" Then make it even sexier. Then, when you're done, you need to make it even sexier. The \"Airotica\" number exemplifies this, and served as the inspiration for Paula Abdul's \"Cold Hearted\" video.The movie brings Fosse's inner circle and personal life to the screen, pulling absolutely no punches. Some call this film a form of narcissism, but it's hard to see how a man looking for self-given glory would portray himself falling apart physically and personally, the years obviously having taken a toll, as well as the emotional baggage that comes with abandoning family life (and a brilliantly played daughter by Erzsebet Foldi, in what would be her only film before she retired) for a girlfriend with some side dishes for variety. The women hate Gideon's infidelity, but love the man so dearly they know not to question or challenge it.Throughout the film, we are treated to vignettes that comprise the mosaic that is the life of Fosse. Metaphors abound, and the music blends effortlessly into a film that can make two hours seem like two minutes. This is not a film that could have been written and will not be enjoyed by those of simple intellects. So much of the plot exists in the abstract, and it is up to the viewer to find what is often an incredibly subtle symbolism. Simply put, this is a well-constructed film. Fosse's ex-wife and dance prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Ann Reinking, auditioned for (!) and won the part based on her, while the supporting cast includes many solid names, even a young John Lithgow as Lucas. Fosse's daughter makes a cameo in the film, as does the film editor. The comedian who appears as the subject of a movie is based on Lenny, a previous Fosse film.Joe Gideon is what everyone should be no matter what they do: someone who doesn't copy others, but develops their own vision and then methodically, sometimes maniacally, makes it happen. He lives in the moment, and squeezes everything he can out of each moment. This is evidenced by Gideon's brilliant work, but also by his rapidly deteriorating health caused by living in the party moments as well as the serious ones.The ending number is for the ages, putting a spin on the sappy endings that musicals are famous for.Your life is lacking until you have seen this film. That it did not win the Best Picture Oscar for its year was an absolute tragedy. It is one of the five best films of all time.",

He also has sex with every woman he can, is a chronic smoker...there's more but I don't want to ruin it.Basically, this is a character study and an absolutely fascinating one. This is Bob Fosse doing a movie about himself and showing his life in an extremely negative light.  I saw this movie when it first came out in 1980. I thought it was one of the most depressing things I had ever seen--but went back to see it three additional times.The acting is just great all across the board--Scheider is cast against type...and pulls it off.  In fact he was nominated for an Academy Award for this performance (he lost to DeNiro for \"Raging Bull\").  Jessica Lange is playing...let's call her Our Lady of the Oxygen Tank (you'll see what I mean).  Seriously, she has a difficult role and plays it beautifully. \nThe direction is superb, mixing fantasy with reality seamlessly.  The songs are good and the dancing is just great (especially in one VERY erotic number about casual sex).This movie is not for everyone--I know of one theatre in which half the audience walked out demanding their money back--but, if you're game, you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.Depressing but just great.

            "content": "A brilliant movie from a brilliant artist, and you'll be reminded of that constantly as you sit through All That Jazz, both in positive and negative ways. This, Fosse's fourth and also penultimate film, is his version of 8\u00bd. But the great success of Fellini's semi-autobiographical masterpiece, easily one of the five or ten best films ever made, is that its author depicts himself with the greatest humility. And not only great humility but, most importantly, honest humility (or at least believable humility). Fellini's constant self-deprecation felt like honest self-criticism, and it felt as if he was truly exposing his inner self to his audience. In All That Jazz, Fosse tries to do the same, but the self-deprecation comes off almost as back-patting. Fosse presents his alter ego, Joe Gideon (well played by Roy Scheider), as a lovable cad. Oh, he might bang every chick in sight, but it's very much applauded.I can complain about these more arrogant aspects of All That Jazz, but what is undeniable is how great a filmmaker Fosse really is. It may be extremely self-congratulatory, but, judging from this film itself and its three predecessors, it can be argued that Fosse deserved the adulation that he supplies himself. As a fan, I loved the way he incorporates semi-fictionalized versions of his previous films into this one. 1974's Lenny plays a major part, as Gideon is going through the process of editing his new film The Stand-Up throughout the film. He brings his daughter to its premier, and, it being her first R-rated movie, she thanks her dad and then asks him why that guy wanted to sleep with two women at the same time. The reference to Cabaret is less pronounced but clear, when, stemming off from the daughter's question about threesomes, Gideon flashes back briefly to himself recreating the \"Two Ladies\" number. This number, of course, was famously created for the film version of Cabaret by Fosse. I'm not 100% sure if there is a reference to Sweet Charity (which would make sense, since it bombed horribly and almost ruined Fosse's filmmaking career), but the musical number with Gideon's girlfriend and daughter begins sort of like the \"If They Could See Me Now\" number, with Shirley MacLaine in Ricardo Montelbahn's bedroom.The musical numbers are something to behold. I think this is a given in a Bob Fosse film, but every single one is breathtaking. The sexy rehearsal number, which leads into the even sexier \"Airplane\" number, would be pilfered by singer/choreographer Paula Abdul in her video \"Cold Hearted Snake.\" More silly trivia, John Lithgow was so goofy looking in his relative youth, that guy who was the captain of the Love Boat and also the dad in ALF has an important part, and Wallace Shawn, of Manhattan, My Dinner with Andr\u00e9 and The Princess Bride fame appears in the most poorly calculated scene in the movie (Fosse wasn't scrutinizing his film enough if he left it in), has one line, and it is the worst line in the entire film.

            "content": "This film is about an EXTREMELY manic Broadway producer (Roy Scheider) who burns the candle at both ends--pushing himself in such an extreme and unhealthy way that eventually he has a heart attack in the midst of a production. Will he survive? Well, while waiting to find out, the film takes an amazing turn. Up until the heart attack, it's a SOMEWHAT conventional film about the making of a play. BUT, after the attack, it suddenly becomes VERY surreal--with many song and dance numbers that explore death! In this sense, the film really is a lot like Fellini's \"8 1/2\"--but with song and dance numbers! I could say more...but don't want to spoil what happens next. Just hold on...the final scene is one of the most amazingly stunning in film history!!\"All That Jazz\" is one of those rare films that I didn't particularly enjoy BUT I really respected what it tried to do. While it is similar, in some ways, to a few other films (such as \"42nd Street\"), the total package is wholly unique--and for that reason alone it deserves to be seen. But, I am warning you, it's very possible you won't like a lot of the film because the leading man is pretty awful--drinking to excess, using drugs to excess, using women to excess--heck, doing EVERYTHING to excess! Interestingly, the film's director, Bob Fosse, intended this as a sort of autobiography--so I assume Fosse was a very talented but incredibly screwed up man...AND, he welcomed the world to see this!! This was either a case of incredible narcissism or perhaps a cry for help or understanding--I have no idea which the case might be! I mentioned how \"All That Jazz\" is a lot like \"42nd Street\". This is because in \"42nd Street\" (the film), Warner Baxter is in many ways the manic Broadway producer that Scheider is in \"All That Jazz\"--and, in the end, he burns himself out and dies--all for the sake of the show. As far as \"8 1/2\" goes, it's much more likely you've seen that and it's a very strange film that explores a film director whose life is VERY hectic and he retreats into fantasy and day dreams to cope with his out of control life. All these films are well worth seeing and would make a great triple-feature.By the way, less than a decade after \"All That Jazz\", Fosse really DID die of a heart attack at age 60. Talk about art imitating life!! NOTE: This film has many adult themes, language and nudity. Think twice before showing this to your mother or kids.",

            "review_title": "Brilliant summary of director/Co-writer Fosse's decent into show biz madness and death",
            "content": "Fosse's ALL THAT JAZZ has been mistaken for a rip-off of Fellini's 8 1/2 for some time. But that is giving it short shrift as an illuminating, sobering account of one man's burnout in the face of enormous pressure from the elements of the entertainment industry which he's involved himself in, namely Broadway and the film industry. Based on Fosse's experiences directing CHICAGO on Broadway and LENNY for United Artists, it stars Roy Scheider as Fosse's always black-dressed alter ego Joe Gideon, who's long road to success has been dotted with drug addictions, one-night stands, betrayals, and show biz phoniness.Particularly of interest in this film is the strong autobiographical quality of it. Fosse did, indeed, suffer his first heart attack during this 1973/74 period of his life. The film-within-the-film, \"The Stand Up,\" is an interesting variation on LENNY (1974, with Dustin Hoffman and Valerie Perrine)---much more irritating than that movie. LENNY ended up getting great reviews, for the most part, but it must have been a tough movie for Fosse to get his hands around, especially while dealing with his failed marriage to Broadway star Gwen Verdon (portrayed here by Leland Palmer). It's certainly portrayed as such in this film.  And Chicago seems to have been a challenge for him, too.  He obviously thought the original script for that show was lacking (as he actually went on record as saying) and that he had to spice it up for him to become interested in it.   (How fascinating would a Fosse film version of CHICAGO have been?   As it was, it looks as if eventual CHICAGO director Rob Marshall screened ALL THAT JAZZ many times in order to mine its many storytelling treasures, including the main conceit that most of the film's musical numbers appear in the minds of the main characters.)Scheider has never been better and deserved real consideration as that year's Best Actor Oscar-winner (he lost, ironically, to Dustin Hoffman who won for KRAMER VS. KRAMER).  He is positively channeling his director's personality, down to his constant cigarette smoking and his artsy goatee (not to mention his snaky, rakish attitudes towards personality responsibility).  The fine cast also includes: John Lithgow as a rival Broadway director who may or may not take over Joe's show if he dies on the operating table; Max Wright (the dad on ALF) as the producer of Gideon's film; Sandahl Bergman (from CONAN and RED SONJA) as the lead dancer in the \"Take Off With Us\" musical number that disappoints the stage show's backers; longtime Fosse girlfriend and dancer Ann Reinking as Gideon's other serious bedmate; Cliff Gorman as Davis Newman, the lead actor in \"The Stand Up\"; the lovely Erezebet Foldi as Gideon's precocious daughter (Fosse's real daughter, Nicole, later appeared in the film version of A CHORUS LINE); Jessica Lange in her first serious role as the Angel of Death; Keith Gordon (an actor in CHRISTINE and BACK TO SCHOOL, who's now an acclaimed director of films like MOTHER NIGHT and the 2003 film adaptation of THE SINGING DETECTIVE) as the young Joe Gideon; Ben Vereen, energetic as a show-biz veteran who \"hosts\" Gideon's final decent into death. The list goes on and on....And the tech credits are superb. The film won Oscars for its Tony Walton sets (Tony Walton has been married to Julie Andrews for years, and is an acclaimed stage and film set designer), its Alan Heim editing (Heim worked on NETWORK, among other things), its Ralph Burns scoring (which includes old jazz, classical, pop, and Broadway standards), and its Albert Wolsky costumes. Its photography, by Giuseppe Rotunno, is also great (Rotunno phtographed many Fellini films and probably had much to do with the lumping of Fosse's film in with Fellini's work).Tying in 1979 with APOCOLYPSE NOW for Cannes Palme D'Or, this is one of the greatest movies ever made, I think, and you'll know that once the first moments--a mass stage audition unbelievably well-edited to the tune of George Benson's version of \"On Broadway\"--unreel in front of you. It's an unflinching look into the madness of one artist that, eventually, became his undoing (Fosse died in 1986, in his early 60s, of another heart attack, after completing only one more movie, STAR 80, and one more stage show, BIG DEAL).

He doesn't ask for forgiveness, he doesn't try to justify Gideon's behavior, and he certainly didn't encourage Scheider to be sympathetic.  \"You're right, I'm a bastard,\" he seems to be saying.While catchy and professional, the musical numbers (particularly the art direction and costumes) range from tasteless to bombastic- as they were intended, I think.  The choreography is precise, the editing masterful, and the performances in sharp focus.  These elements, plus the acerbically mournful script, make for a fascinating deconstruction of self to an extent rarely, if ever, seen in the movies.Not every artist should think himself so interesting, but thankfully, both Fosse's professional and personal life merited such honest examination.  I can't think of any of our more iconic filmmakers today who have been turned the camera back on themselves in such unflinching fashion.Note:  Among the direct parallels to Fosse's actual career are \"The Stand-Up\" to \"Lenny\", and Lithgow's snooty Lucas Sergeant to theatre's estimable Harold Prince.",

But everything else about All That Jazz is so great, it is one of the better 1970s musicals and one of the most unique ones you'll see anywhere along with Ken Russell's The Boy Friend. All That Jazz looks spectacular, the editing, costumes and art direction all won Oscars that were richly deserved. The editing and cinematography is some of the most imaginative of any musical, the costumes are rich in colour and the art direction is wonderfully opulent. The score also won an Oscar which was also deserved, it captures all the glitz and glamour of musical theatre brilliantly with no over-sentimentalising. The songs are ones that you will have no trouble remembering, Take Off With Us being the highlight. And they are superbly staged and imaginatively shot with choreography that is unlike what you've seen before and since, plus it is very rhythmically driven(again the very erotic Take Off With Us is the standout, though Everything Old is New Again is very sweet). The reality parts of the story blend surprisingly well with the more fantasy-like ones, the reality stuff is often hard-hitting and unpleasant but very real like Joe Gideon himself while the fantasy has a real surrealism to it. Fosse's direction is truly impressive, yes some scenes like the death sequence is a touch self-indulgent but there is his usual pizazz and rhythmic precision while also very Fellini-esque, reminding one somewhat of 8 1/2. Roy Schneider gives a blistering career-best performance as a very sordid character with a good amount of complexity. Jessica Lange is alluring, Leland Palmer is equally solid and Ann Reinking is equally charming. The director-daughter relationship is touchingly done. Overall, a wonderful, if somewhat divisive, musical and one of Fosse's best alongside Cabaret. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Directed by legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse, All That Jazz is painfully autobiographical; we know it, and so does Fosse. What we receive is a film that is both robust but recklessly uneven, uncompromising in its vision. Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is aging in his long and paramount career. As a man in love with the stage and never willing to invent a normal, strictly crowd-pleasing production, he has become exhausted; he works only with frenetic energy and is willing to stay up hours upon hours to perfect his goals. But all those years of light sleeping, pill-popping, alcohol consuming, womanizing, and smoking have finally caught up with him. Joe can barely handle it.In All That Jazz, Fosse's ideas are fearless, conveyed only in lightning speed. But only about half of them are thoroughly successful. His inhibitions are sometimes extremely dynamic, energetic, even touching, while others remain dynamic and energetic but lack that impassioned stinger. Take the \"Take Off with Us\" sequence, for example. The scene sees Gideon previewing his planned dance numbers for his upcoming play to executives who are offensively conservative but scared of being, dare I say it, mean. The one that comes before \"Take Off with Us\" has all of that theatrical ambition of a Fame piece; the executives already have the feeling that they're witnessing moments from their newest blockbuster. But what follows turns the practice studio into a smoking orgy of choreography, dubbed \"Airotica,\" leaving its dancers nearly nude, sweating profusely, and rumbling around in sexual energy. It's one of the best dance sequences I've ever seen in my life. It's the pinnacle of the film. Nothing truly follows it with that same brash excellence.Fosse is a treasure in the world of Broadway and a sporadic genius in the movies. All That Jazz is his 8 1/2, both stylistically and in tone. In style, it's slightly Truffaut, unafraid to jump cut, use \"natural\" music, and combine the contempts of real life and the joys of fantasy. In tone, it's almost uncomfortable in its self-reflexiveness, as the film mirrors Fosse's life.Yet in the end, All That Jazz is split down the middle between annoying self-indulgence and filmmaking brilliance. Fosse's boldness is easy to appreciate, but there are times when the film's in your face style leaves you with a headache rather than a new lease on life. But Scheider is terrific and so is Fosse's choreography; All That Jazz is the definition of a mixed bag, if there ever was one. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",

            "content": "With the kinetic edits capturing fully the energy of a Broadway cattle call and punctuated perfectly by George Benson's jazzy version of \"On Broadway\", the opening sequence of Bob Fosse's 1979 autobiographical musical extravaganza is so dazzling that the rest of the movie feels like a series of climaxes awaiting the big finish...literally. Fosse, who also co-wrote the script with Robert Alan Arthur, encapsulates his own hectic life into a patently self-indulgent movie with unmistakable style and verve and isolated moments of sheer brilliance. His doppelganger is Joe Gideon, who is juggling a major Hollywood film about a stand-up comic (like \"Lenny\") and a major Broadway production starring his ex-wife (like \"Chicago\"), while simultaneously dealing with his failing heart and a splintered domestic life. A demanding perfectionist, Gideon drives himself with unbounded energy, a heavy smoking habit and an excess of medications. This leads him to the hospital where he faces a personal abyss monitored by the Angel of Death, here a diaphanous woman named Angelique. Gideon's pending mortality starts to take on the stamp of his own productions until reality and fantasy become indistinguishable.As anyone who has seen \"8 1/2\" knows, Fosse's film has a Felliniesque aura about it, but the dancer/director/choreographer brings his own unmistakable brand to the film with his rhythmic pacing, unique choreography and show biz savvy. It's a blend that sometimes works quite well, for example, in the erotically charged \"Take Off With Us\" number and the sweet pas de deux between Ann Reinking and Erzsebet Foldi on Peter Allen's \"Everything Old Is New Again\". Yet, at other times, Fosse comes across as narcissistic and self-serving, especially during the extensive death sequence set to the Everly Brothers' \"Bye Bye Love\". Luckily, Fosse cast Roy Scheider as Gideon, a smart move given the actor's innate lack of vanity makes the character's self-absorption more tolerable. It's a smart performance well turned and not overly excessive given the opportunity. The rest of the cast is serviceable though little more - Broadway veteran Leland Palmer as Gideon's ex-wife Audrey, obviously modeled after the legendary Gwen Verdon; Reinking playing a variation of herself as girlfriend Kate; and Jessica Lange, just after the \"King Kong\" fiasco, most alluring as Angelique. The 2003 DVD is fairly modest on extras - scene-specific commentary from Scheider, brief interview snippets with Scheider, and very brief vintage footage of Fosse directing the cattle call sequence.",

            "content": "A terrific opening sequence involving a cattle call of dancers being reduced to about a dozen or so gives way to an indulgent, but still mostly entertaining autobiographical look at the director's life. Legendary choreographer and director Fosse was on top of the world professionally the year he won an Oscar an Emmy and a Tony, but, soon after, he keeled over from a heart attack and nearly died. This film is an artistic expression of that near death experience, examining his work ethics, his personal turmoils and his creativity. Scheider pays the character closely based on Fosse. He is simultaneously editing a film starring Gorman and developing a stage musical featuring his estranged wife Palmer and a gaggle of dancers. Meanwhile, he is romancing (though that may not be the best word) Reinking and finding occasional time to parent daughter Foldi. Each morning begins with a shower, a handful of pills and a cigarette as he drives himself nearly into the ground with an obsessive approach to every detail of whatever it is he's working on. Lange (in the role that helped bring her back from the disaster of \"King Kong\") looms near Scheider as an Angel of Death until it's time for him to succumb. The bizarre approach to the storyline (having Scheider chat with a death figure prior to joining her) was unusual (though not completely original) at the time, but has been repeated many times since in things as diverse as \"Dallas\" and \"De-Lovely\". The primary appeal here is two-fold. First, is the spot-on, stellar performance of Scheider. Because he is not a singer or dancer, he isn't the first person that springs to mind for a role like this (and was, in fact, an eleventh-hour replacement for Richard Dreyfus, who would have been all wrong physically), but he rises to the challenge beautifully. He isn't called upon to do a lot of dancing and does even less singing, but he perfectly embodies the self-destructive whirlwind who was Bob Fosse. Secondly, the film contains several impressive dance sequences, one performed by a virtually nude ensemble. As Scheider himself noted, the film does in the first eight minutes what \"A Chorus Line\" took two hours to do (albeit, obviously, without the many great songs and dances in that show.) There are also several numbers featuring the talents of Palmer and especially Fosse's own famed prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Reinking (who portrays a variation of herself, though she, famously, was asked to audition for the role!) Fosse fave Vereen also figures prominently in at least one number. It's a film that will doubtlessly mean more to fans of the director and to those who are somewhat familiar with his life and work than to the casual viewer. Others may find it to be a little too self-indulgent and lengthy. Oddly, Foldi, who did a very fine job as the daughter, was never seen again on film! Palmer never worked on film after this either, preferring to live in Israel. Many popular Broadway performers are interspersed into the cast Including Frederick, who also appeared in \"A Chorus Line\".",

            "content": "To think that Fosse synthesized musical theater, artistic obsession, relationships, fatherhood, and satire all within the framework of a deconstructionist film musical and made it all about himself to boot (including predicting the manner of his own death) without being the least bit self-congratulatory is amazing.  The film is edited beautifully; choreographed flawlessly; lit with stark colors that almost fade to black and white at times; and acted with heart and verve, especially by Roy Scheider.  The film has one of the most effective uses of the zoom lens (despised by most filmmakers precisely for their inability to figure out when to use it) in film history.  The shot pulls back from a lone choreographer on the stage while multitudes of bodies go flying by him, letting us feel his insurmountable task of choosing which of these people will make his show come alive.  Some may say the final series of musical numbers runs long but I defy anyone these days to sustain a musical film with the same success.  \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"Chicago\", excellent films that they are, play their cards fast and furious, hoping to razzle-dazzle us just long enough that we'll stay tuned.  \"All That Jazz\" dares to show you a taste of musicals to come (\"Take Off With Us\") and yet insists you remember where the form came from (the Busby Berkely-esque \"Who's Sorry Now?\"). When will they come out with the DVD?  We can only hope soon.",

Film also stars Ann Reinking as a fictional version of herself and Leland Palmer as a fiction version of Gwen Verdon.While it's a fascinating look and \"putting it together,\" from CHICAGO auditions to the grueling rehearsals (amid Fosse's endless womanizing), it's also wearing on the viewer. After 90 minutes, we launch into the endless \"death\" sequence which features a smarmy Ben Vereen at his worst and a series of trite goodbye songs. This entire sequence should have been cut from the film. It grinds on and on and on while Jessica Lange (as the angel of death) hovers.The film does not improve with age. Scheider and Palmer are good, but Reinking is always hard to take. Cliff Gorman appears as Lenny Bruce even though he did not get to star in Fosse's film LENNY. We also get Anthony Holland, John Lithgow, Wallace Shawn, Deborah Geffner, Max Wright, Michael Tolan, Sandahl Bergman, and Theresa Merritt. The homely girl who plays the daughter is painful to watch.Had there been a real editor around to trash that last half hour, this might have been a good film.

            "content": "Artistic people probably do not understand how creatively-lacking people function in their day to day lives. Uncreative people judge artists are pretentious, ridiculous, and unrealistic because of their own lack in understanding of an artistic mind. Ignorance no longer need be a problem, not once you see All That Jazz. I've never seen an artist's thinking, inspiration, and life depicted better in a more flashy, colorful, and wild film.The protagonist, Joe Gideon is for the first two thirds of the film, practically never captured on screen without a cigarette on his lips. Watching All That Jazz is like stealing the cigarette from his mouth and inhaling his artistic expression. The most obvious aspect of All That Jazz that is successful is the manner in which its technically made. Bob Fosse is the director here and each scene is directed with such precision, you can feel the real-life, artistic pain melt off the screen. In a film that centers itself around dancing, the choreography is feisty, swift, and collectible complex and inventive. The sets and costumes are dazzling and prove the film cares about it's look just as much it does entertaining us and even more so than both of those, it makes a priority of saying something about artists. The film editing is used as a poem of madness and completely works for All That Jazz.The grounding strength of All That Jazz is Roy Scheider being front and center breathing life and artistic \"smoke\" into the film. Never a moment where he takes things too far, everything is held back like a man who has bit off more than he could chew would hold things back. Scheider is perfectly astute and the film wouldn't be the same without his understanding of the character and story. All That Jazz is centered around a flawed man with a drug addiction, uncontrollable sexual desires, stress levels that go through the roof, and personal relationships that have more bumps than they are smooth. Yet, we understand this man's life and work because of Scheider.All That Jazz is bright, flashy, and seeking attention to this business and lifestyle. Artistic people are misunderstood by people as some sort of hippie that tries to sway away from \"the norm\" any chance they get. No, they understand themselves and feel they have something to share with the world. They see the world differently than \"normal\" people do. They have a firmer grasp on what things mean to them. It almost feels like a style of film Fellini would be directing. All That Jazz is in tune with the the work, the stress, and the real-life hardships that come as a package deal in the entertainment industry. The film is like shining bright lights on big distress.Through this wild, raunchy film, Fosse makes a commentary on an artist's experience understandable to the common man in a very entertaining way. All That Jazz reinvents the word style, flashing new visuals, songs, and choreography at us every minute. Filled with art, dance, and personal expression, All That Jazz will suffocate you with its fantastically told metaphor of an artist's life.",

Sounds good, and with all the dazzle, it should never get slow, but by some miracle it does. Even the grand final number goes south, getting repetitive as the camera swoops, the films cuts, the dancers writhe, the lights glare. But it sure is visually exciting, and there are some great dances and some great sets, improvised and elaborate both. And Scheider is convincing as an unattractive, drug enhanced, chain smoking middle aged man. The plot whirls with growing inevitability, and the quasi-surreal heaven scenes with Jessica Lange are stiff and \"stagey\" which might be on purpose (it's like Broadway heaven, maybe). What you really have is a patchwork of dance numbers, some hugely talented dancers, and a selfish lead male lacking charm. It's a tough watch if you aren't predisposed to Broadway musicals. The best relationship, between the director and his little daughter, is quite touching in parts, but oddly this is abandoned by the end, and we are left only with mania and ego, in that order.",

It's something to be scared of under any circumstances, but at that time the outcome was problematic in a way that it no longer is. It's as if Fosse were first in a long line.The musical numbers. They progress from realistic, excerpts from a show Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is choreographing and directing, to hallucinatory by the end, a frightening congeries of monsters and plastic anatomical models. When Gideon is asked how he feels before an angiogram and says, \"The truth? I'm scared,\" we can believe him.Scheider is a fine actor but this part really calls for a dancer. And what dancing we see. Such dedication, skill, and fitness, of a kind required only of athletes like tight ends. A viewer must pale with awe, seeing the rehearsals. And of the dancers, Foldi and Ben Vereen are particularly appealing. Oh, and Sandhal Bergman, whose bare bosom requires a review all its own. The songs are eclectic but innovatively arranged and orchestrated. Your fingers tap even as the characters die.Gideon dies, we are more or less told blankly, because he smokes, boozes, lies, and screws around. He is morally flawed. Big deal. The problem is that he dies because he was alive in the first place. It's not the tragic story of a fall from greatness -- no \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Coriolanus\" -- but a change from life to death. Would Gideon have lived longer had he become, say, a vegetarian? Maybe. Then he would have been granted more years in which to become old and faded and impotent and forgotten. I don't mean to be too glum about this but the movie itself raises these kinds of questions. Or, as Edgar Allan Poe put it, \"The play is the tragedy \"Man,\" and the hero the conquering worm.\"Do not watch this movie if you have ever gotten drunk, lied, smoked, done drugs, or fooled around. I'd even hesitate to watch it if I'd used cuss words. But I must sum it up by saying that it is an example of how close any single human being -- Fosse in this case -- can come to turning his own failures into a work of art. What makes it as strong a fable as it is, is that Fosse does not give us easy answers. Even vegetarians must face eventual dissolution.",

Story is for the most part about Bob Fosse but he calls himself Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) and the film starts with the auditions for \"Chicago\" and during this he is also editing a feature film about a stand-up comic so we see that he is a workaholic. He also chain smokes, sleeps with various women and neglects his daughter Michelle (Erzsebet Foldi). Everything around him is causing tremendous stress to his already fatigued body and in his imagination he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique (Jessica Lange). Gideon's condition gets worse and he checks himself out at the hospital and he learns that he has two clogged arteries and needs heart surgery. The backers for the broadway show must now decide if they should delay the opening or replace Gideon as the director. The film shows Gideon reflecting back on his life and the decisions he has made and how he feels about his own fate. Fosse cast Roy Scheider as Gideon and Scheider pulls it off pretty well. I'm not sure if he did his own singing or not but Scheider does possess a lean athletic body that was needed to make us believe he's a dancer. You have to give him credit for doing such a remarkable job in a role that most would not have cast him in. *****SPOILER ALERT***** I found it interesting that Fosse had the character Gideon die at the end of the film but I think Fosse was trying to make amends with his own past. Its as if Fosse used this film as a way of changing and letting everyone know that he's a changed man. The old Fosse is dead and the new Fosse has moved forward. Lange was reportedly dating Fosse at this point and thats why she was cast in the film but it turned out to be an important role for her. She garnered good reviews and it helped some people forget the wretched \"King Kong\" debacle. Some familiar faces show up in this film like Max Wright, Michael Tolan, Keith Gordon, John Lithgow, Sandahl Bergman, CCH Pounder, Vicky Frederick and Wallace Shawn.

Jessica Lange (Angelique) \"Normal\" '03 was Joe Gideon's guardian angel and the wife of his dreams.   If you look closely, you will see a great actress who was never given a break in the film business, she is Irene Kane (Lesie Perry, TV Movie Critic) who starred in \"Killer's Kiss\" '55 where she gave a very dramtic role, this was Irene Kane's last performance in this film.   This film over the years has become a great classic to be followed-up with \"CHICAGO\", view it whenever you can.",

With the exception of The Wizard of Oz, I can't think of any film where this works well. Bob Fosse was a groundbreaking maverick who lived by his own rules, so in that respect I suppose I can appreciate the craftsmanship of this film, but ultimately a self-portrait should withstand close scrutiny, and I feel that he should have gone a different direction to portray his own death. It's hard to fault Roy Scheider's natural intensity, and he seems a good fit for the main character, but why in the world wouldn't he learn to dance more, if he were that committed to the role, it would have been impressive to see his moves in the final numbers instead of lying around being sung to by Ben Vereen.",

Oh, and did I mention the incredible dancing?Shunned by reviewers because of its nastily undisguised look at such theatre luminaries as Harold Prince, Michael Bennett, Stephen Schwartz and Gwen Verdon, and film luminaries such as Dustin Hoffman, the movie has started to re-emerge as the definitive movie of musical theatre and dance. You can't help but realize this when you discover that even Paula Abdul has used the famed \"Take Off With Us\" dance sequence as the basis of one of her own music videos.Not for the faint-hearted, this movie is loaded with talent, beautiful and jarring images, and even a moral. It maybe intentionally repugnant, but this was a \"mea culpa\" from a generously talented man who survived his hedonism and sought to warn others awary from its inevitable effects.See it. Enjoy it.

I had absolutely no idea what it was about, but I noticed that Roy Scheider was in it and he's a fantastic actor, so i figured what did I have to loose? I slipped it in and this is definitely one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. Like I said I had no clue what it was about, so I even watched it twice just to clarify things and still I was just left dumbfounded. The way this film was made is not your typical biography, it does have exciting dance sequences and a lot of trippy scenes. It's strange to say, but it's very dated by the way this film was made. Roy does a knock out performance, not his best, but it makes the film work, but I just don't think this was a film for my tastes.Joe Gideon is a choreographer who is tough, but unique. He always cooks up something good and everyone just adores him, including an endless line of women. Let's put it this way, the line of women he's had an affair with could go around the world twice. We go through his life story, how he came to be who he was. A chain smoking perfectionist who worked non-stop to get ever step and beat down. The critics start to worry that he is loosing his touch, Joe works harder than ever to prove them wrong leading him into a physical break down, but he is determined to put the greatest show on stage.Roy really makes the film worth your watch, so I felt like my time wasn't totally lost. I just couldn't get into this movie. I think it depends on your tastes, it's just made very strangely, which I did understand the direction they were going for to understand Joe's madness, but it just wasn't for me. The whole dream sequences with I think her name was Angelique were just a little off key, I know why she was apart of the story, but it was just a little too strange. I'm not sure if I could recommend this, the only thing I can say is that it is a one of a kind film that you have to be in a certain mood for.6/10",

            "review_title": "a cheerfully ironic and devilishly self-indulgent plunge into the spirit of Bob Fosse",
            "content": "I should be inclined to say that All That Jazz is much too full of itself to really pull off as an entertaining comedy-musical. But then again, the whole tone of Fosse's \"semi\" autobiographical splurge, less so much a typical film, is to comment on self-indulgence in movies, while at the same time embracing it, going all out with crazy musical numbers involving rehearsed airline erotica and two Joe Gideons with one within-a-movie directing the other laid up on a hospital bed. But what does make it a deep work, as did Fellini's 8 1/2, which Fosse obviously loves to the point of hiring the spectacular Giuseppe Rotuno to do the cinematography, is that it laments the end of life by celebrating the enjoyable mania and despair of its protagonist. Although Fosse can't totally compare to the penultimate film about the creative crisis of an artist (the angel of death scenes are hit or miss, depending on the context, and unlike Mastroianni there seems to be too much forced on Scheider to be almost exactly like Fosse, at least in myth, with the cigarettes and pills and women), he does make it often exhilarating cinema, and hilarious cinema with the touch of someone who is cynical but not afraid of speaking the truth, about talent, creativity, love, and just plain living. Never has being and nothingness been portrayed with choreography so extravagant (if that makes sense)! The premise is actually very simple, as most musicals should be: Gideon is preparing his latest musical of free-wheeling sex and luridly fun (we're never too sure what it's \"about\" as he zones out completely during a script reading), and editing a film on the side, while also dealing with his many women on the side sometimes meeting one another in the bedroom, and his daughter, the one pure fountain of innocence who may be catching some of Gideon's attitude. But the stress, and pressure, of being on top of his game all the time knocks him out- on top of the usual barbiturates for f***ed up artists, leads him to the hospital with horrible heart problems, of which he doesn't take too seriously, even when he's on his last breath. Fosse turns tragedy into self-reflexive entertainment on a self-consciously buoyant scale; I can only think of Singin' in the Rain as another musical that is as explicitly fun- if not as dirty and outlandish- at portraying serious subject matter.Fosse aims maybe too high, if that's the only problem, particularly with a final musical number that is catchy as hell (and how could it not, shuffling off the mortal coil), if maybe TOO catchy, if that's possible. However this isn't something that becomes a deterrent, on the contrary it's like watching some acrobat out of a dingy Bronx hell-hole who puts on quite a show on the high-wire. Certain musical numbers will forever remain my all-time favorites, chiefly the 'rehersal' performance that Gideon puts on for the producers to see of a highly erotic number called \"Take Off With Us\", proclaimed approximately by his ex-wife to be \"the best thing you've ever done...you son of a b****\". Then there's the hospital-bed number, where deep-rooted psychological angst not only gets some up-beat razzle dazzle, but even a wink and a nod to Fosse's directorial style, (\"you missed your line\"). While the sub-plots put in place, namely with heel John Lithgow and the budget problems of the musical production, don't serve much of a purpose aside from slightly interesting fodder, leading only up to whatever great little moment, little weak or totally cool gesture Gideon may make, even when he's hooked up to a breathing machine.At the end of it all, what makes All That Jazz sensational movie-making is the combination of strong subject matter, of the flawed brilliance of a man such as Gideon- via Fosse himself- with a completely assured hand of style. The dancing is terrific, the camera movements are always apart of the action itself (Rotuno gets the frame almost to dance with the others), and Scheider is particularly great. Following the lead from a certain TV 'critic', I give it three and a half out of four balloons!",

But Scheider's antics come at a price as overwork, exhaustion, a weakening body and a total disregard for medical opinions threaten to end his life much too soon.

Accolades (the vast majority of public opinion) are looked at as grains of salt while rare detractors throw emotional stones that are debilitating and damaging. Fosse is definitely one of the more interesting film-makers in the history of the cinema and \"All That Jazz\" ends up being a difficult, endearing and dominant success that foreshadows the all-world director's ultimate demise a few years after this film's 1979 release. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

But this one gives you an entertaining and noisy view of the life of an artist. Then, is silence ...The story is a perfect portrait of Bob Fosse's life and his thoughts about life, family, childhood, music, money, women, sex, believes, cigarettes and of course ... show business. The movie told us the story of Joe Gideon, a very knew artist in show business. But he has an illness. Now he look to present, to past and to future. Angelique is waiting him ... Roy Sheider (Steven Spielberg \"Jaws\"), Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking (Close, very close friend of Fosse who mades with Vereen -who appears too in this movie- famous \"Fosse\", a musical homage on Broadway), Leland Palmer, Ben Vereen, Erzsebet Foldi, Michael Tolan and Deborah Geffner stars in this perfect portrait of show business, dreams and tears.Bob Fosse's works in theater and movies are impossible to forget for those who has witnessed (Obviously i cannot see their plays - only parts in video - i born 4 years after his death, but thank God i have his movies to enjoy). His works in stage and screen includes \"Cabaret\" (Which, years after made his own movie adaptation), \"Sweet Charity\" (His film debut later. A marvelous adaptation to Fellini's \"Notti di Cabiria\", which are marvelous, funny and touching), \"The Pajama Game\", \"Damn Yankees\", \"Pippin\", \"Dancin'\", \"The Affairs of Dobie Gills\" (With Debbie Reynolds), \"Give a Girl a Break\", \"Kiss me Kate\", \"How to Succesed in Business without a Really Trying\", \"The Little Prince\" (As the Snake), \"Lenny\", \"All That Jazz\" and his last work \"Star 80\". In all his work we see a real artist working. Excellent as choreographer, director, writer and actor. And we can see perfectly this in \"All That Jazz\". And if much see it as a pretentious work, its because maybe they cant see how the really show business is. \"All That Jazz\" is a fabulous work that much of us maybe can appreciate. Is more than Fosse's life, is about his dreams, about his point of view of life, death and stage. The point of view of an artist who love its works, but a work that demands much (The related topic of Ingmar Bergman's \"Smulstronst\u00e4llet\"). Then begins health and family problems. And we see that show business can be actually a good thing, but here is a question that not even me can answered ... the show business really worth? However, Bob Fosse demonstrate to the world his amazing world. He lives a life of light and dance. But too lives a world (If we follow \"All That Jazz\") of pain. Bob Fosse's life is a great teaching of survival to all that crap of selfishness of the same show business, and how is ore important the artist vision, how the art - which contains the thoughts, the love for anyone ... the point of view- cares much than the show business.One of the best musicals that i have ever seen.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",

This character has seen every side of fame, where again in the utilization of story, this one is played out like Lenny, in a back and forth format.

Basically Joe Gideon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Roy Scheider) is the workaholic, chain smoking, drug taking and womanising theatrical director and dance choreographer who is trying to work on both a Broadway musical and film he is making. He does have the people who care about him, his Kate Jagger (Ann Reinking), his ex-wife Audrey Paris (Leland Palmer) and his daughter Michelle (Erzsebet Foldi), who try and stop him from causing himself so much stress and self indulgence, but he has had too long to make his body overly exhausted, and his heart condition is diminishing. Gideon is rushed to hospital after suffering a heart attack, he is placed in the ward admitted with severe angina, and despite the show production being postponed in his absence, the show still goes on in his imagination, where he also flirts with the angel of death, Angelique (Jessica Lange). The cardiovascular charts show no signs of improvement for Gideon, as he has been continuing to smoke in secret and causing more stress for his heart, and the only option is to perform a coronary artery bypass surgery. Meanwhile the show makers are debating whether the production can continue without him as director, but they decide instead to bet on the likelihood of Gideon dying to make their money back, which would give them a profit of $500,000. Gideon is having more surreal but dazzling dream sequences featuring musical numbers with Kate, Michelle and Angelique singing about his past experiences, direct to his hospital bed. The final parts of his own personal musical feature the five stages of death - anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance, and we get a final hallucinatory extravagant number where Gideon himself gets involved himself on centre stage, of course in real life his life has ended. Also starring Cliff Gorman as Davis Newman, Ben Vereen as O'Connor Flood, Erzsebet Foldi as Michelle and Michael Tolan as Dr. Ballinger. Scheider creates both a sleazily charming and amusingly detestable character, the direction by Fosse (a dance choreographer and musical director himself) has created some fantastically eye-catching sequences, most based on his own experiences, all beautifully captured and edited with colourful background and sparkling costumes, adding up a highly entertaining musical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound.

In the scene juxtaposing Gideon's open heart surgery with the conference on the insurance value of the show (one of the most compelling scenes in cinematic history; it manages to be graphic while maintaining dark comedic cadence) is Fosse making the cynical satirical point that life is cheap because a fiscal value CAN be put on it? Or is he mocking the cynics with a hard penance of life's bloody fragility right in the face? Those are philosophic points to be sure and there's such a rich variety of them in this movie, as to dazzle the mind. But to just concentrate on the cerebral is only half the wonder of this film which is a strong contender for Top 20 status in this writer's mind.The other half - pure Fosse - is the range of artistic expression utilized to present an integrated total whole. It's a movie that takes you the viewer on your own artistic journey from the guts of a production to the unseen polished art in Gideon's heart and mind, where even mortal death must be turned into art to be defeated. Shots of tedious life are shot in tedious muted tones, the footage looks raw at these times and if it owes anything to Fellini it's that the more hyper the closeup or edit to sparse angles, the more \"real\" the subject becomes and the LESS you feel you are watching a film.Time doesn't permit me to go on, and I don't know if any new viewers will even see this review - but if they are reading this, and you love great cinema - this is it.pax vk",

I had never known Schieder was this good an actor; and haven't seen much of it from him since then. \nCheck this movie out, it touches you.",

            "content": "1979's ALL THAT JAZZ is definitely one of my favorite films, a permanent part of video collection and a film I can watch over and over again without tiring of it. This dark, twisted, self-indulgent, musical version of Fellini's 8 1/2 seems to be Fosse's exploration of his own personal demons as he lays his life out there for all to see in a not too flattering light as a career-driven, hard drinking, smoking, womanizing director/choreographer who is alive when he's on a Broadway stage creating dances or behind a camera lens but is clueless on how to deal with regular life and the little imperfections that most regular folks are able to cope with and accept. Roy Scheider delivers a brilliant performance as the Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon, who is trying to stage a new Broadway musical and put the finishing touches on a movie he directed and the stress of all this work puts him in the hospital after a heart attack. This story was based on the period in Fosse's career when he was beginning to mount the musical CHICAGO for Gwen Verdon and was still editing his 1974 film LENNY with Dustin Hoffman and had a heart attack shortly afterwards. This film sucks you in from the beginning with shots of dancers warming up onstage as the opening bars of George Benson's \"On Broadway\" begin to fill the audio. Soon the camera pulls back to reveal hundreds of dancers onstage as Gideon weeds out the dancers he wants to cast in \"NY to LA\", the fictionalized version of CHICAGO. This number is just brilliant and is a wonderful introduction into the world of NY theater auditions for the uninitiated. Fosse, is, more than anything, a choreographer, and his dance direction in this film is nothing short of astonishing. I can watch the \"Take Off With Us/Air-Rotica\" scene over and over again and never tire of it. I also enjoyed when Ann Reinking (as Joe's girlfriend, basically playing herself) and Erzsebet Foldi (playing Joe's daughter, Michelle (Nicole))do a dance for Joe to Peter Allen's \"Everything Old is New Again\" in his living room. Joe's fantasy production numbers after he enters the hospital are also dazzling, especially long-legged Reinking's rendition of \"You Better Change your Ways\". There are also small quiet moments in the film that are equally effective, in particular a lovely scene in a dance studio with Joe and his daughter where she tries to talk him into getting married and giving her a little brother. This is not a side of Gideon we see much of (Fosse either) and it is a lovely moment. Jessica Lange's ethereal quality was used to great advantage in her small but showy role as Joe's Angel of Death. Leland Palmer (who starred in Fosse's PIPPIN on Broadway) registers as Audrey Paris, Joe's ex-wife and Michelle's mother, a fictionalized Gwen Verdon. Her scene with Scheider in the dance studio where she calls him on his constant infidelity is a gem. Cliff Gorman scores as Davis Newman, the star of Joe's film, THE STAND UP (this film's version of LENNY), who is seen visiting Gideon in the hospital and psychoanalyzing him at the same time. The \"Bye Bye Love\" finale is a little over the top and WAY too long but I like the end of it when he says goodbye to everyone before his death (especially loved the looks exchanged with John Lithgow and his hug with daughter Michelle). All in all, ALL THAT JAZZ is a must for Fosse-ites and fans of musical theater..whether it's stage or screen. Not as good as CABARET, but still a unique movie experience to be savored.",

            "content": "Few movies have given insight into the grim reality of show business than All That Jazz. Director Bob Fosse's semi-autobiographical musical is highlighted by entertaining and terrifically choreographed numbers which give unexpected depth to the storyline. This unconventional blend is anchored by the outstanding performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon. As the movie's focal point, the title character is loosely based on Fosse himself. Gideon is a man addicted to his work in show business and the vices that come along with it. Rather than a straightforward autobiographical tale, the dramatic narrative is rather uniquely presented. All That Jazz blends conventional storytelling, musical numbers, and an astonishing first person point-of-view sequence where Gideon suffers his first heart attack. All these elements intertwine seamlessly in pushing the story along to it's grim yet inevitable conclusion. The result is a masterful work of art by a true genius. The film, however, does not get bogged down by the song and dance moments and maintains believable realism with it's depiction of a man's journey towards his own self-destruction. When Roy Scheider passed recently, I thought immediately of his memorable work in All That Jazz. This is a movie that really stays with you, and there is no other film like it. All That Jazz was the swan song of a great decade in film-making, and brought to it a rousing yet unfortunate close. The 1970's were an unparalleled era in cinema defined by groundbreaking and truly important works of art. A time when directors took the medium as a serious form of entertainment and storytelling, while raising it into previously uncharted heights. This is one of the finest examples.",

It's a multilayered piece of neurotic fiction disguised as a musical about life and death, held together by a wonderful ensemble cast and some beautifully abstract dance numbers.

Although they're both surreal films with an autobiographical basis, they're also very different. All That Jazz was an integral part of the artistic revolution in Hollywood in the 70's and it was way ahead of its time for American cinema; and even if a lot of it seems indulgent and uneven, it holds its own shockingly well thirty years later. Unlike a lot of bio-pics which hold interest only for those interested in the subject, All That Jazz holds a profound and bleak statement about show-business, success, humanity and morality, all told through Bob Fosse's own experiences. Fantastic musical numbers as only Fosse could make make sure that it's entertaining, breaking up the constant darkness and depression and makes it a great film experience.",

            "content": "For about half the duration, I thought this was going to be a masterpiece, a bit of late but considerable innovation for the musical. All the way back to Busby Berkeley in the 30's, the musical was a film about our film being put together, this was already a worn-out trope by the time of this. But there were clear demarcations in those days, between a life you agonized about in terms of creative love and the big stage where all of it was magically danced right.So I thought the experiment, a very interesting one, was the same template - a film about both a film and a Broadway show - but blurred lines between stages and dance spliced in the small moments, not the perfect dance, but the one that is human and flawed. It has all sorts of new cameras capturing that, or thought to be new then on this blockbuster level. It has Welles. It has Altman's roaming eye. It has Nouvelle Vague. Cassavetes. Kubrick. All of it blends in one style that is pretty cool to watch. It is visual jazz in the sweep of improvisation.So the first half of this is just a beautiful melange of sometimes cold intimacy being confessed inbetween poise, and the poise is as spontaneous as the people improvising feelings, making it up as they go along, as we all do. But Bob Fosse was an egomaniac, so it was not enough to give snippets of life being danced into motion, a rehearsal of life. It had to be a big show. It had to razzle-dazzle us.The problem is that Fosse is just not, as a thinker, a cinematic jazzman. The second half is maudlin, crass (thinking he will shock), obvious, self-important, ordinary in that frivolous way that passes caprice as insight. It seems like someone is out to impress instead of being content to evoke.The good thing that came out of this is that it probably inspired Dennis Potter to write his own autobiographical musical of sorts, The Singing Detective, a beautiful work of much more earthy imagination.But apparently the French were impressed.

I know that this was a labor of love for Fosse, and that it has eerie similarities to his death several years later. Yet every time it feels like Fosse is about to make a serious emotional statement, he ruins it with a silly fantasy or pointless dance routine. This is probably why the scenes with his wife and daughter are among the best, because they're the only ones that don't get interrupted by glitter and gaudiness.Bob Fosse could have made a film that depicted the struggle of the Broadway artist, that really showed us the ups, downs, and betweens of working in showbiz.

Two hours of self-regard masquerading as self-loathing, of egomania as a substitute for content. It's not the cast's fault, nor the crew. It's all down to Fosse.

And in fact, this film's structure is often compared to Federico Fellini's 8\u00bd, another thinly-veiled autobiographical film with fantastical elements.Again, this is perhaps one of the best musical films that i've seen so far. The choreography is dawn good, there's really a lot of effort put in it. The numbers are really great as well, specifically the last one. The acting by Roy Scheider is without a doubt great. He brings to the screen the perfect image of a baroque mix of the disturbed and egocentric man. The editing is also perfect. The sequence which repeats multiple times in the film, where Joe is awaking up, going to shower, taking his pills and playing the music is priceless.The art design is good as well. I sometimes thought that i was myself into a Peter Greenaway film, due to the familiar and similar use of colors to turn the ambient and the atmosphere into a weird and beautiful one at the same time.So, what else can i say about this film?

The dance sequences are spectacular, right from the opening audition scene to the final farewell and I loved the musical score.

Choreographers are usually dancers themselves, and are inspired by what they see around them and use what they have learned and seen within the dances they makeup for the dancers they are choreographing for. Within the dramatic fantasy musical, All That Jazz, directed by Bob Fosse in 1979, the main character, Joe Gideon is a dancer and choreographer who is struggling to hold onto reality.Joe Gideon is a career-driven, hard drinking, smoking, womanizing director/ choreographer who is alive when he is on the stage. When he isn't on stage he doesn't know how to deal with his life and lies so much to others that he doesn't know where the lies begin and end. He has to deal with his ex-wife his daughter, Michelle, and his girlfriend. Because of Joe's speed addiction, (the pills he always pops) smoking, and career addiction Joe finds little time to be with his daughter. There is one particular scene where he is with her and she asked him to remarry and give her a little brother. But Joe has no intention to remarry and is too busy trying to stage a new Broadway musical and put the finishing touches on a movie he directed and the stress of all this work puts him over the edge. He has already suffered from a heart attack and is now having a lot of health problems. His left arm begins to stiffen and hurt, and this shows throughout the movie by him holding it and trying to stretch it. Joe Gideon is an amazing choreographer who is having difficulty holding onto reality and is slowly dying. He is eventually put into the hospital because of his bad health and he doesn't take it seriously. Finally he comes to the point where he doesn't want to die and he tells the angel of death that he sees that he isn't ready to die yet. After massive amounts of surgery Joe finally realizes that he is going to die, and he accepts it. Within the last scene of the movie Joe sings \"Bye-Bye Love,\" within this song he gets to say goodbye to all of his loved ones and friends. Obviously he is not really doing this and its inside his head, but that is what is able to get him to let go of his life and pass on",

Sweet Charity had already demonstrated Fosse's prowess in syncing movement with sound - that's just basic choreography. Here he injects rhythm with the cuts themselves, condensing an afternoon of initial dance rehearsals into a montage bursting with vitality and colour. The dancer's movements are spliced and rearranged into a single cohesive unit - graphic matches merge their individual pirouette into one multicoloured blur, like a spinning top. They drag their feet to the sultry beat of George Benson's On Broadway, and leap into the air in perfect sync. The experience is a complete performance on its own, and already Joe has his eyes on a select few (and not just purely for their dancing). For him the only ritual more steadfast and constant is in his morning sacrament, a Dexedrine, AlkaSeltzer, and copious eyedrops, all enlarged in grotesque extreme close-ups. Is playing Vivaldi over it all an attempt to convince himself of some semblance of serenity? If so, it's an uphill battle. This daily intravenous drip allows him the zest to commit to several different creative projects at once, a string of women and a thick smog of chain-smoking, and then to do it all again the next day. Joe is a true artist in the sense that he is a perfectionist in his work, and a hurricane's wake in his private life. This being showbiz, the two often intermingle in an incestuous embrace, with dance as the sole bridge for conversation. That may be the only way to get his attention, as all three of ex-wife, girlfriend and daughter discover. Joe may have giddy tears in his eyes as the latter performs an impromptu rendition of Peter Allen's Everything Old Is New Again, but the acerbic cut to his morning routine suggests an unchanged man.Why does he throw himself into these projects, even at death's door? Some contemporary critics note the flaw of his impenetrable character; Joe's motivation remains ever-obscured behind a haze of drugs, sex and musical numbers, with hardly a moment devoted to why. Why? The show is his life, and his life is a show, forever destined to contest for centre stage. They can chastise his lack of devotion or loyalty all they want - it isn't something he doesn't already know anyway - as long as it's done in costume, and in time. Fosse's choreography suffers none from this maddened attentiveness; his bodies stuttering from movement to a frozen strut, limbs cocked at odd angles and splayed across each other. It's sexy and suave all at once, and none too pleasing for the anxious financial backers sitting in the test audience. \"Now Sinatra will never record it,\" they moan as the dancers bare their chests (and see how Fosse splices together their yawns in the opening rehearsal). Joe is loyal only to Angelique, an angel of death played by the glittery Jessica Lange. Their tango takes place in an imaginary set decorated with both past and present relics of his life, costumes once worn and now discarded. She's his witty equal, an angelic figment of the imagination that is at his every beck and call - no other girl could suffice, or put up with his constant professional negligence. His daughter Michelle gives it her best shot, although her presence is one of the film's glaring oversights, a chatty, flippant teenager who only fits within this frenetic, showbiz lifestyle because Fosse pipes in her wit through poorly dubbed ADR. Watching her tease Joe on the free-flowing sexuality of one of his numbers is like witnessing a comedic skit of an entirely different film.Only in his daydreams do these dances attain his final seal of approval. While the business executives are busy musing over the potential financial gain of his early demise (bluntly overlaid graphic images of his dissection), he's hard at work stage-managing procession. It's usually here that detractors bemoan Fosse's excess, the self-indulgence of an artist who can't even bow out without a blasting fanfare and at least three elaborate set pieces. In some ways, they're not wrong (I like my dream sequences fleeting and with a devastating gut punch, like the finale of Claire Denis' Beau Travail). And yet, why would Gideon/Fosse ever want to hold back? A little heart attack never hurt anyone, not when there is dancing and directing to be done. It's showtime, and the show must go on.",

            "content": "From the moment Bob Fosse's All That Jazz starts, just about every scene is memorable whether it is flashback or hallucination.This is one of Roy Scheider's top roles. His Joe Gideon is a man with two much. Two much work, too much wine, too much cigarettes and too many women. His life is reviewed by the Angel Of Death (played by Jessica Lange) and sometimes we see him discuss with her points in his life when he should have done this and not done that etc. etc.It has been well documented that part of this film is based on certain aspects of Bob Fosse himself. There are many moments in this film that i love beside the musical numbers.1. Joe Gideon getting a chest examination from a Doctor coughing himself to death.2. Joe's daughter making faces at him from a departing Taxi as he waves to her in the pouring rain. Sweet moment.3. The rehearsal of the script scene, when everyone is laughing at a line in the play loudly, but Joe can only hear his own breathing and actions.4. Joe constantly tampering with the editing of his new film, convinced it is going to be a disaster.5. And finally, Joe (to the song 'perfect day' by Harry Nilsson) waltzing with one of his dance girls in his apartment then taking her to bed...simple but priceless.The choreography in this film is amazing. From the opening auditions for the fictional Broadway play to the last hallucination number, all the songs are wonderful and get better and better with each viewing. Favourite song moments are 'Fly Away With Us' (all the dancers in this scene are fantastic) 'After your Gone' (song brilliantly by Leland Palmer) and the final 'Bye Bye Love' which will bring a tear to the eye as it plays out. Special mention must go to Ben Veneer for a show stopping cameo as an imaginary TV personality and Ann Reinking as Joe's lover who dances superbly.If you love musicals like Carbaret and Moulin Rouge, then you will love All That Jazz, for me its my personal favourite Musical of all time!

Whilst this inevitably results in touches of self absorption, pity and narcissism, Mr Fosse has given us some of the greatest and most admired musical films, ever, where he combined human tragedy with artistic spectacle and the sense of really getting the most from his stars. The star in this is the choreography and its interpretation. Running alongside and crossing between outer body experience and real life but that line being somewhat blurred, Roy Scheider is always at loggerheads between his artistic and excess-all-areas lifestyle, with the results thereof introducing themselves in various forms. The censors, producers, doctors, lovers, cast members and cigarettes all have a big role in his daily battles, but at the end of the day, we are all immortal and are just a body with a brain in its skull. Don't let me put you off...it's largely entertaining, hugely at times but never too dark or morose. Just don't expect all sweetness and light with joyous numbers.It's Cabaret without Liza Minnelli, but with a somewhat bitter genius who doesn't sing, or dance. Enjoyed the former? Then you'll get a lot from 'All That Jazz'.",

It references to \"eight and a half\" (a Fellini film about a director who straggles between the women of his life and the film he can't make) and Godard's 60's films (Specially \"A Woman is a woman\", with a reference in this film to Fosse's directions in theater: the films pauses and Anna Karina has a sentence: Careography by Bob Fosse!). The shots of All That Jazz reminds us to Godard shots, and subjective narration remind us to Fellini. The Theme of the film, A director in the search of a way to make his own film (that would never been made) is also The theme of Fellini's masterpiece, and reminds us to Fellini's world. But all that jazz i said is bullshit! This is a film about life and death. It seems to be a person who has made this film, is drunken the cup of life to the end. I remind you one of the final scenes which Joe Giddeon kisses an old woman, and of course it doesn't need to remind the final \"Number\" With an eternal song: Bye bye life, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness... . I have never seen a movie like this which shows us the deepest dreams of a man in show business and his own cinema, and of course his own family and his own love. This is an eternal film that i can't describe it with the words. Some films are being honored to get Palme d'or but this film has gloried the Palme d'or.

Legend has it that Shirley MacLaine (who Fosse had directed in the film of SWEET CHARITY) told him to start taping conversations he had with people about his heart attack as the basis of a stage show or movie. The end result is ALL THAT JAZZ> It's a brilliant and intense look at the insecure but brilliant Joe Gideon (based on Fosse himself and played by Roy Schneider). In the first five minutes of the film alone Fosse manages to capture more of the angst and worry of auditioning for a show than A CHORUS LINE THE MOVIE does in two hours. What follows ins a roller coaster ride through Gideon/Fosse's life directing and choreographing a new show while battling chest pains. These scenes are inter-cut with fantasy sequences where Gideon converses with Angelica - a seductive angel of death played by Jessica Lange. As much of Fosses later works - this movies is full of Broadway glitter and jazz alongside disturbingly dark themes such as death, infidelity, and substance abuse. Fosse's self vision is unflinching and as in real life we manage to actually cheer for Gideon even though he makes such lousy choices in his personal life much the way so many people adored Fosse despite his treatment of them. Of course when it comes to choreography and filming dance - there is none better than Fosse and this movie shows you why. ALL THAT JAZZ is simply a masterpiece of movie musicals. just don't expect ANNIE or WHITE CHRISTMAS. This is all about the grime and sweat beneath the glitz.",

            "content": "Of all the supposedly great 1970s films that critics love to gush over, one they should be gushing over is this brilliant and sensational pastiche of razzamatazz, artistic ambition, obvious roman \u00e0 clef and a starkly unsentimental view of show business. \"All That Jazz\" is all that and more.The late Roy Scheider shows the strength, depth, and range of his abilities as Joe Gideon, the hard-drinking, hard-living, hard-loving director of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films. It is largely because of his performance that the film is a success. For all the horrible, irresponsible things he does, Scheider makes Joe an extremely sympathetic character. It is easy to see why the women in his life, and his daughter Michelle, keep coming back to him in spite of everything; they want to love him. Underneath his cynical exterior is a burning desire to live, love, and be loved. The pathos in his life is handled beautifully and without a trace of sentimentality. The supporting cast works well, too, notably Jessica Lange as the angel of death, Ann Reinking (\"Annie\") as Joe's girlfriend Katie, Max Wright (\"ALF\") as the harried producer of Joe's film \"The Standup,\" and Cliff Gorman (\"The Boys in the Band\") as the lead actor in that troubled film.Technically the film is a marvel. Fosse is at the peak of his directorial ability, and every scene shows a master touch. His musical numbers are some of the most exciting ever conceived for film; they are sensual, rhythmic, dynamic, and remain fresh after all this time. Fosse wannabes who have co-opted his unique style only serve to prove their own derivativeness (I'm talking to you, Rob Marshall). The editing fits the directorial style like a glove.This was truly the best picture of 1979; not \"Kramer Vs. Kramer,\" and not \"Apocalypse Now\" (nothing against those two films, though). It truly deserved the Oscars it did get, and the Palm D'Or at Cannes. It's certainly a lot more fun than 8 \u00bd.

The drama, the passion, the love of art, the sweat and blood and tears, the triumphs and failures...this is life in the theater.

A legend of 1970's Cinema, a guy who is still underrated in my opinion & yet has given us some absolute Classic's such as, JAWS & JAWS 2 & BLUE THUNDER & THE SEVEN-UPS & LAST EMBRACE & THE FRENCH CONNECTION!!! This guy is one of the reasons I'm a film fan & movie geek as i grew up watching Scheider in Jaws & Jaws 2 & his iconic role as Police Cheif Brody is probably the first film character i knew by name & loved. Scheider has always been there as a recognisable face in films from when i was little & watching videos all the time, i also loved The French Connection & Blue Thunder. Truly Roy Scheider is one of my all-time favorite actors (in my top 3) & is such an amazing screen presence, Jaws wouldn't of been as great without Scheider as Brody.Here Roy Scheider delivered one of, if not his best, Performances of his incredible Career. Roy is mesmerising on screen in all his sweaty & energetic glory, he's so charismatic, funny & tragic all at the same time. It was exhausting just watching him. Truly one of the best performances of the 70's & in movies in general!!! Joe isn't a bad man or a good man he's just a guy that lives too fast & wants everything all at once. We get scenes with his daughter & he's a good father but at the same time he's constantly distracted by his work on his show & trying to edit his movie & all the women he beds. Joe is a man obsessed with sex & how much he can get of it. The movie is a musical in ways but mainly a drama, a drama that is both dreamlike & realistic at the same time. All That Jazz is superbly directed & acted, Scheider should've gotten an Academy Award.I really enjoyed this film even though i have no interest in musicals but i had to watch it for Roy Scheider's performance & i just love 70's filmmaking.

Somewhat in the vein of 'Chicago' and 'A Chorus Line', but not as enjoyable as either.Some SPOILERS follow, so please read no further.In this movie Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is the director and choreographer who lives a very unhealthy lifestyle, abusing tobacco and prescription drugs, sleeping around, and trying to ignore symptoms of heart disease. The movie alternately flashes to the 'present' where Joe is conversing with the Angel of Death (Jessica Lange) in a dream-like state and to various parts of his past, some as a young tap dancer being tempted by the strippers, some as a cheating husband, some as the choreographer and director of a work in progress, some as a hospital patient undergoing open-chest surgery for his bypass operation.

I was in High School at the time \"All That Jazz\" came out, I sat through this film and the only part I liked was \"the guy on the bed watching his life pass by his eyes as a choreographed dance number.\" But I had no idea why.Years pass, and when I thought of \"All That Jazz\", all I could think about was a little girl on a white hearst singing to her dad in a dream sequence to stop messing himself up and live for her. I really wanted to see this film again. There was something I wasn't getting. Finally in 1990, I go out and buy this film. I absolutely had a different view and I absolutely loved it. Why? Because by that time I had found out WHO Bob Fosse was and realized what he did was something very hard in the Hollywood Industry, he gave you a film about his life that he directed and choreographed ---before he died!A Premonition? A Prediction? A Re-Call from his heart attack?Now, it seems like common place for folks who never knew the person to run out and do films of famous people and their lives after they're cold, cold in the ground to object.Here, Fosse actually did a film squarely about HIS life, told to you...by him. Not only that, he went to those in his industry to help him! Dancers he worked with, and in sme cases made stars out of them  and even lovers he had. If you're not aware of this, this film may seem kinda dull and trite to you. It did to me, but now that I know, it's a brillant peice and a card Fosse left behind so that there would be little mistake for folks to know somewhat more deeper (not too exactly but close enough) about him.Fosse takes the time in his life that when all his demons and his dance with death came to head...Directing and Editing the motion picture \"Lenny\" and at the same time staging and Directing \"Chicago\". Yes, he was a driven workhorse, but he was also a womanizing slime bucket, an adultrer,  at times a clearly negligent father and all the while always with his little secret crush on \"the angel of death\". This was Fosse's vision of how he thought he would leave the earth, this is his telling to you of how he was...and in my view, it was brilliant in its timing of such-- in its film release and in it's telling.Brilliant film by a brilliant...and very flawed genius.",

            "content": "All That Jazz is a biopic that reminds me of the recent Oscar winner Chicago in that the main character is so passionate about show business that the line between reality and the stage become blurred. Chicago, I really did enjoy watching because it took this idea and went with it full-force mixing melodramatic scenes with musical song-and-dance numbers, where as All That Jazz didn't really go full-force in any direction and ended up in an awkward middle ground. Centering on Broadway dancer Joseph Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, the film relies on a couple recurring motifs and chronological disorder in its storytelling to convey its effects. One of the motifs is that Scheider starts out every day taking some kind of prescribed drug, drinking a cup of water with alka-seltzer, putting eye drops in his eyes and smiling in front of a mirror exclaiming to himself, 'It's Showtime', which just has the overall effect of making him appear distanced from reality.The other big motif is that there's a certain blur of events time wise, especially when there are frequent interruptions in the story in which Gideon is talking to a pretty attractive woman, Jessica Lange, who happens to be the Angel of Death, so that makes the film a sort of surreal flashback. The whole thing left me more confused than anything else, and also by the time I figured out who she was, the story's protagonist was in the hospital and it was unclear whether he would survive, so I felt like the answer to that question was ruined.I really liked the opening musical number as a crowd starts out on a Broadway stage trying out for a show while the song 'On Broadway' is playing and one-by-one Gideon sends them home until he whittles it down to the cast we'll become more familiar with over the course of the film. It really has an interesting vibe to it as are some of the behind-the-scenes aspects of Broadway we see in this film, but they didn't show too much of that.When I really think hard about why this film didn't cut it for me, it points to the fact that despite Scheider's efforts, Joseph Gideon, and I don't even know if he's an actual real-life person, just isn't anyone interesting enough to make a biopic about. The gist of the man's life was that he was very talented and genuinely cared about those who loved him, but he also couldn't stay loyal to any one woman and slept around, even while he was married. Well, I'm sorry, talented and womanizer is nothing new. Judging from all the scandals and divorces going on in Hollywood.

I just saw it again, and my goodness, I enjoyed it ten times more this time around! This is not a true biography of the movie's director, (Bob Fosse) but a fictionalized account of a overworked Broadway and movie Director named Gideon(!!). He is played here by Roy Scheider in one hell of a performance. Who knew that he had such range! Singing, Dancing, you name it! He's putting on his new musical and in the finishing stages of editing his new movie. Day by day, you can see the stress pile on to him. Plus, it doesn't help that he's a chain smoker..Fosse edits this movie brilliantly, using the Gideon character in the current time, and also using Gideon reflecting on his life, while talking to a character, played by Jessica Lange (whose character I won't reveal, so not to spoil it for you (but if you were paying attention, you'll easily pick it up).What can I say? This has the best choreographed scene I've seen in a long time. The Airotica number is so well done, choreographed and edited that it simply took my breath away. Of course, this theme was the inspiration for the ending of Flashdance and Paula Abdul's 'Cold Hearted' video. Nice to see the original.And the ending, my god. One of the most perfect endings, period.I saw this on VHS. I just might the DVD",

            "content": "It is rare for a celebrity director to flay their skin to show you the mess underneath, but that's what Bob Fosse did in All That Jazz. His alter ego Joe is brilliant and self-destructive, successful and riddled with doubt, honest when it will hurt others but unable to fully see himself. He creates great art and lays waste to the lives of those closest to him.It's as though Fosse is saying, \"yes, this is who I am, yes, it's awful, yes, it's gonna kill me, and no, I can't change.\" The movie follows Joe as he works on a stage musical while finishing the editing of a movie clearly patterned after Fosse's film Lenny. We repeatedly see a standup routine from the movie that is remarkably unfunny, which is annoying although it's used well towards the film's end. (Trivia: the comedian in that scene is the guy who originated the role of Lenny on stage.)Throughout the movie, Joe flirts with death (in a weirdly literal way) and wreaks havoc. He also choreographs. The early audition scene feels very real, and the first half of the movie feels more like a drama with some musical scenes than a musical, but somewhere along the way Fosse starts throwing terrific numbers at the audience.This is a really weird movie. It's a bit offputting at first, but stick with it.",

            "content": "Sam Peckinpah's \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\" was a personal movie Roger Ebert admired for its 'brutal honesty' calling it a \"bizarre masterpiece\". Allow me to steal his line to describe the Golden Palm winner of 1980, an oddity that could only germinate from New Hollywood's imaginative fields and growing on anyone who'd give it a second or a third viewing (one isn't enough).Bob Fosse's \"All That Jazz\" is a personal film and -to put it simply- a love-letter to entertainment from a professional's perspective, not a fan's. The passion of an observer, no matter how accurate, is inevitably undermined by distance. Bob Fosse IS a performer, his love for Broadway isn't Scorsese's \"fascination\" for gangsters or Miyazaki's passion for planes, he loves it as something defining passionately and madly, a part of himself.The film's memorable leitmotif is Vivaldi music playing while an Alka-Seltzer tablet dissolves in a glass, some drops put in green-blue eyes, Dexedrine pills, a shower and then Joe Gideon -Fosse's alter-ego- lifting his palms in front of a mirror and uttering the film's motto: \"It's showtime, folks!\". The ritual is played over and over throughout the film as to show that a talented choreographer can't make good routines without a few bad ones structuring his life.Indeed, Gideon's a chain smoker, drug-addict, sex-addict, workaholic, alcoholic, the price to the commitment to his profession while the outcome is the energy and positive vibes he infuses to his crew and the producers, his fatherly manners and even sex appeal. It's self-destruction for the sake of creation, the tragedy is that creation is inconstant, inspiration fluctuates, but we do witness a decline in health, highlighted in the \"showtime\" interludes.The film follows Gideon, caught between a musical production and the making of a film named \"The Stand-Up\", a nod to Fosse' directing of Lenny Bruce's autobiography (Cliff Gorman who played Lenny in the stage version reprises his role as the comedian) while making a Broadway version of \"Chicago\". So the film isn't implied but meant as a semi-autobiography, which gives an eerily prophetic taste to the decline of Gideon, especially when we know Fosse died eight years after the film, at the age of 60.Like Peckinpah or Hal Ashby, Fosse died in the 80s before any possible comeback leaving us \"Cabaret\" or \"Lenny\", movies that ennobled entertainment, making them drivers, results and comments on their own narratives, the 'Cabaret' burlesque numbers worked like a Greek Chorus, the downfall of Lenny Bruce was punctuated with post-death interviews while his troubles or experiences inspired most of his comedic interventions. In \"All That Jazz\", Gideon's life inspires his acts and his acts affect is, that's the Fossean cycle, we're all our lives' own protagonists.Stage is where Fosse made his bones and it all naturally became the embodiment of life with family, friends, colleagues as players or viewers. Fosse is pushing up to the extreme the notion that there's some spotlight shone on us when we die so even if we lead a so-so life, we can die in a blaze of glory, like a show, a great finale can redeem everything. Maybe Fosse made this great film because he didn't think much of himself.But if we can't evaluate the talent of Gideon, the best tribute to Fosse's talent is Roy Sheider who wasn't a dancer to begin with and only known for a streak of top-notch thriller movies in the 70s. Fosse just gave him his greatest role. And Sheider returned back the favor by giving his best shot as Gideon. Honesty and guts always pay back. And \"All That Jazz\" is so personal it never cheats, so personal it was even deemed as self-indulgent. Yes, there's some reverse narcissism behind self-deprecation but self-indulgent?Fellini was praised for \"8\u00bd\" but Fosse goes deeper than all the Oedipal details any viewer could relate too. Fosse undresses his soul, predicting his downfall, only sugarcoating it through a surreal flirting with the Angel of Death, played by Jessica Lange. Even death is portrayed like a beautiful woman, a part of the show. \"All That Jazz\" like Fellini's classic ventures in the improbable world of entertainment metaphysics. As Minnelli said: \"Life is a cabaret\". And yes, we wouldn't be so absorbed by its extravaganza if Fosse wasn't so self-absorbed.But the film isn't all flash and strass, it has moments worthy of comparison with Hollywood classics, the finale and Gideon's health-affecting dedication echoed \"A Star is Born\" and \"42nd Street\" but the beauty of \"All That Jazz\" can be found in 'smaller moments'. I was caught off-guard when Gideon's ex-wife (LeLand Palmer) made that dancing routine in the living room with their daughter and you could see Sheider's genuine emotional reactionFosse was also talented in capturing simple, heart-warming and tender moments, here, a family reunited and a mother just having fun with her daughter. That intimate sequence became an instant favorite just like the \"South American Way\" moment in Woody Allen's \"Radio Days\". Speaking of Allen, there's something oddly Allenian in the film's 'couch approach' to an author's life and relationships with his producers, family, mistresses, doctors, it's also Fellinian in its sensible, empirical emotional exploration. But style-wise, it's all Fosse!The director spits out his soul in the story, culminating his career and the New Hollywood period with a last Hurrah. There would be no musical nominated for Best picture till \"Moulin Rouge!\" (live-action anyway if we consider Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\") Fosse would die in 1987 of heart attack as if exhaustion had finally caught up with him. So, it all comes down to one question: would a true artist trade a few years of his life to make a masterpiece?A fraud would say no, an artist would say yes, a tormented genius might make his death a masterpiece, and \"All That Jazz\" contains perhaps the greatest \"exit\" to any cinematic movie character ever.",

Joe Gideon (Scheider) is a play director and choreographer, along with being a womanizer, drinker and drug user. At times, he has conversations with a fictional woman Angelique (Lange), who resembles a sort of angel. When Joe has a heart attack, he learns that his ways have caught up with him. The musical numbers in this are so strange, yet strangely fantastic. About 5 of the musical numbers are hallucinations of Joe's when he's in the hospital. Bob Fosse obviously based Joe on himself, and based this on how he figured his life would turn out, and sadly he was correct. \"All That Jazz\" is consistently brilliant, but the way the end was done just blew me away. A bouncy and happy musical hallucination about death, all leading to Mr. Gideon finally meeting Angelique head on, and then the final scene, which in it's own way was amazingly powerful. This is definitely not for everyone, but all should at least enjoy it for it's amazing direction, choreography and of course, music.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 121 mins.

            "content": "The film All That Jazz, details the life of Joe Gideon, who is based on Bob Fosse, who ironically wrote and directed the film.The film uses flashbacks to create depth for the characters. For instance, Joe Gideon has a vision of a beautiful woman all in white; this is the Angel of Death, he is dying. While talking to this Angel, he has a vision of his childhood, when he grew up in the Burlesque house. This scene allows the viewer to see what kind of kid Joe was and how he became the man he is today.Sound is very important to this film, it's all about music and dance. One scene in particular is when the script scene appears. All the surrounding sounds were taken out and it focused on his breathing, knuckles cracking and everything else he was doing, everything else was muted.All That Jazz is a dark and depressing film that deals with drugs, sex, and death. These are controversial elements to add to a musical. The lighting used enhances the sexual elements in the film, especially in the dance number in which all the dancers dance in the dark, but the spotlight hits a few. These dancers begin taking their clothes off and everything becomes sexual, which upsets everyone.The final dance number is a vision that Joe has on his deathbed; once again the dancers wear all white, which symbolizes angels. Joe has made many mistakes in his life and in this scene he asks for forgiveness. All his friends and family are in the crowd or dance number.This film is still influential today, with quick editing and montages such as: Joe taking a shower, taking pills and taking eye drops. All of those are seen in the recent film Requiem for a Dream. All That Jazz is a different take on the musical that tries to go for controversy rather then a cheerful jolly ending that most conventional musicals do and this film should be applauded for doing so.",

On a second level, it is a film about recklessness and mortality. Running throughout the film is a third element, acting almost like a Greek chorus; his efforts to complete his film, \"Lenny\". But there is a very significant difference; \"Lenny\" was a movie about a really funny comedian who was legislated into madness. ...but that's not what the film within the film is. The movie Joe Gideon works on relentlessly is of someone trying hard to be a comedian who tells rather unfunny gags about death and dying. With a tremendous amount of effort, Gideon manages to turn this lousy footage into a better, more polished work that gets released, even though he is still unhappy with the final result.It seems apparent to me that the film he is working on is not \"Lenny\" at all; it is, in fact, \"All That Jazz\". Take away all the dancing and music, and \"All That Jazz\" is just a movie about Bob Fosse's self-destructive lifestyle told in an entertaining way. The filmed routine he is editing (which is making fun of the \"seven stages of dying\") ends up melding with the rest of the story - acting almost like 'table of contents'.

Maybe I'm biased since I'm a huge fan of Fosse's work, but I still think that this film is brilliant in many ways. First, you have the choreography. I can't watch a number like \"Take Off With Us,\" or \"Everything Old Is New Again,\" and NOT want to get up and dance. I get goosebumps just watching it.Next, you have the actors. Roy Scheider is the better than I've ever seen him here. With his goatee, cigarette, and black boots, he really looks like Fosse (although the character is not supposed to be Fosse himself, just based on him). Ann Reinking is one of the greatest dancers who ever lived, and it doesn't hurt that she was Fosse's girlfriend portraying Joe Gideon's (Scheider) girlfriend in the movie. Leland Palmer and Ben Vereen both starred in \"Pippin\" on stage for Fosse, and their talents are utilized again here. Add in the star power of Jessica Lange as the mysterious Angel of Death, and you've got a winning cast.Lastly, you have the material, and the way Fosse handles that material. You could write a book comparing the movie to Fosse's life with analysis after analysis. Instead, I'll just say that the style and pacing of the film is near-perfect - until the end. It loses a little bit of its energy with the too-long and drawn out production number \"Bye Bye Life.\" It definitely could have been shorter. But the cynical message of the movie is not to be missed for those who enjoy dark movies, and especially for Fosse fans (although his \"Cabaret\" is better). 8/10",

Some have accused Fosse of egotism for putting this semi-autobiographical account of himself onscreen.

Its meta-tale of the slow deconstruction of a man and his ego takes the quick cut aesthetic of Fosse's earlier expressionist masterpiece Cabaret (1972), but adds to the mix the almost terrifying reality that this is not a dream, this is Fosse's real life.The plot revolves around Fosse's fictional surrogate Joe Gideon's (deftly portrayed by Roy Scheider) efforts to balance his excessive lifestyle with the demands of simultaneously making a motion picture and directing a Broadway production. The real story, however, revolves around the masterful editing and surreal song-and-dance routines which build layer upon layer into the tragic melting pot.An ongoing interview with an angel of death, a repetition of the Gideon's daily routine of booze, pills, sex, and \"showtime\", and a multitude of stories, plays, and films within the film make it a real delight to watch. Perhaps it's not the simplest thing to get your head around when you're just looking for a feel-good musical, but that is not why All That Jazz is here: this is art.It must be said, however, that, for the final effort from one of the most accomplished musical directors and choreographers to ever grace the screen, the dance routines and musical numbers don't hold much water compared to a lot of other films. Yes, the ending Bye-Bye Life is a truly remarkable piece of cinema, but on the whole most of the actual 'musical' elements of this film don't really stick in your mind. Every dancer is more than competent and the whole thing is shot and edited with a touch of genius, but the routines themselves are just a little bit lackluster.The real accomplishment of this film, however, is not in its ability to be as good a musical as, say, Grease (1978), but rather it is to be found in the way Fosse expertly weaves the art-house cinema techniques of Fellini with the high camp of a Busby Berkeley number. It is a visual and intellectual feast that holds the audience from start to finish and does not leave them dissatisfied.It just plays out its almost Wagnerian opera sensibilities on such a grand scale that it hard not to be impressed by this film. The masks keep falling, the intrigue keeps on deepening, but it is all treated with a profound sense of subtlety that is rarely captured by films so lavish as this one. It is, in my opinion, one of those rare movies that you simply must see, even if you don't actually like musicals. Find yourself a copy, dim the lights, pour yourself a nice glass of champagne, and brace yourself for a long and winding ride through the heart, soul, and mind of one of the most interesting showbiz personalities of our time.",

Ann Reinking and Leland Palmer, Roy Schieder's principal characters of his own character's life, are absolutely dazzling in dance sequence after dance sequence.And there is the final number.

While it is true that choreographer Bob Fosse tells his sordid life in this film, it is also true that the movie has an air of absolute craziness. There is a very thin line drawn here between reality and fantasy. True, Fosse depicts his addiction to pills as well as his incessant smoking. It's as if he has a death wish and he is standing defiant to death in his dance sequence scenes.I was surprised that he didn't totally put his nursing and physician staff in full dancing mode as well.This all being said, Roy Scheider totally captures the Fosse element and he did receive a well-deserved best actor Oscar nomination. Competing against Dustin Hoffman in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" could not be overcome nonetheless.I did like the fact that when reality sets in at times, we see that business comes before everything, including the demise of its top director.Ben Vereen and Ann Reinking are fabulous in their respective parts of literally lighting up Broadway. Nonetheless, after a while, the film becomes tedious when that fine line of reality and fantasy become utter confusion.",

            "content": "A self-reflexive, semi-autobiographical reflection on choreographer/director Bob Fosse's own life and career, \"All That Jazz\" follows middle-aged Broadway and film director Joe Gideon, who attempts to juggle a new stage production, the editing of a feature film, and his relationships with his daughter, ex-wife, and girlfriend, all amidst his own ailing health after years of excess.It's a common sentiment that, though a lush and at times upbeat quasi-musical, \"All That Jazz\" is ultimately a depressing film. While this is an understandable position, I would argue the exact opposite: that it is really an affirmation of life in its purest form. What makes \"All That Jazz\" so unique is Fosse's storytelling mode, which blends hyper-editing and insightful vignettes from Joe's life, with musical numbers interspersed at varying moments for heightened effect. The storytelling is unconscious and plays out through suggestion; this is not to say that there is no linearity, because there is, but the back-and-forth between objective moments in Joe's life and the dramatized, stylized musical sequences ultimately renders a kaleidoscopic view of him, really getting to the heart of the character.The musical numbers themselves are, unsurprisingly, extraordinarily designed and a pure joy to watch. Roy Scheider turns in a career-defining performance as Joe, while Ann Reinking and Leland Palmer--playing Joe's girlfriend and ex-wife, respectively--offer poignant performances in addition to impressive footwork. Jessica Lange also appears as Angelique, an \"angel of death\" manifestation whom Joe occasionally commiserates with throughout the course of the film.While the lyrics to the film's climactic musical number are almost head-scratchingly macabre on paper, \"All That Jazz\" nevertheless proves itself as a heartfelt celebration of life, death, art, and love--and it has enough emotional intelligence to know that none of those things can exist without the other. As someone who tends to dislike musicals as a rule, this is one of my favorite movies--a rare cinematic tapestry that transcends genre. 10/10.",

            "content": "\"All that Jazz\" is one of my favorite movies on many levels. As a professional dancer, I scrutinize it choreographically, I also get major butterflies watching the cattle call at the start of the movie. Nothing like being treated as a numerical piece of dancing meat. That is EXACTLY how it is. I get a major kick out of watching that poor guy who is totally lost, and is desperately trying to follow the other dancers, rather than picking up the choreography from the dance mistress. Yup, there is usually one of those and you have to give them credit for being at the cattle call in the first place. The \"airline\" combination was incredible, and right on dead perfect! I was grabbing for air by the end of it, just like the dancers on the screen! The combination that was done by Ann Reinking and the girl playing Joe Gideons daughter to \"Everything Old is New Again\" was just as the others, spot on. Ann Reinking is an incredible dancer! Now as to the non-dancing aspects.... Joe Gideon is an everything-a-holic, and those people really do exist. They are totally consumed, and they will burn out pretty fast, thus the morning ritual, of cigarette, Vivaldi, Alka-Seltzer Visine, and a Dexie. Not a very good way to live....... he is trapped between his art, his \"a-holism\" and his love for his daughter, which is the steadying force in his life. Roy Sheider plays that part magnificently, and in an almost heartbreaking fashion. He really nailed it. The choreography in the dream sequence was once again absolutely incredible and absolutely Fosse. Just wow..... Finally, his death finale was the way any artist would like to check out.... dancing and busting there gut for an audience...... Although Joe Gideon truly bombed in his relationship bag, he blew the top off in everything else he did... although the movie he was trying to shoot, was clearly not his best effort, and he was never very happy with the \"Stand-Up\"...... And how better to end a movie about dancing and the \"Biz\" than with Ethel Merman singing \"There's No Business Like Show Business!\" I can't think of a better, or more gritty movie, than \"All That Jazz\"",

            "content": "A semi-autobiographical musical that leaves the viewer feeling confused and slightly disappointed, \"All That Jazz\" was directed by Bob Fosse and released in 1979. Following the life of Joe Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, as he choreographs, womanizes, and abuses his way to self-destruction, \"All That Jazz\" actually chronicles the life of Bob Fosse \u2013 a well-known musical theatre choreographer and director, screenwriter, and film director. While the art direction is superb, the costumes nearly flawless, and the score really, really moving, I kept waiting for the film to get better, and it never did. Between the wide area of subject matter (from the movie that Gideon was supposedly editing, to rehearsals for a new musical that he was staging, to his various complicated relationships with his ex-wife, girlfriend, and daughter), not actually knowing who Bob Fosse is, and the random, seemingly nonsensical Angel of Death (Jessica Lange) scenes, I spent the entire movie feeling like I was on the outside of an inside joke.The movie was choppy. It is not the editing and transitions that were choppy \u2013 and what transitions were choppy were that way for artistic value \u2013 but that the film jumped from one area to the next without giving the viewer time to catch up. In one scene you would be watching Gideon direct his dancers in the moves for a number, in the next he would be conversing with Angelique, the Angel of Death, on a topic that seemed to have nothing to do with the rehearsals we had just seen, and then in the next scene, he would be editing a movie that seemed to only be included in \"All That Jazz\" because it focused on the various stages of death. While some could argue that such choppiness was for artistic value, or that it was to make a specific point, I would say that you lose the value and the point when the movie becomes unintelligible and impossible to keep up with.The costumes, although there wasn't really all that much to them until the closing scene, were great. The mis-matched leotards and leg warmers contrasting with business suits and button-down shirts, only seemed to add to the gritty, slightly maniacal feel of the movie itself. The score was my favorite part of the film \u2013 along with the final number where Gideon sings to an audience of the movie's entire cast. The score was sharp and impeccably crafted and worked endlessly to try to create emotions and reactions that the choppiness of the film itself only took away from. The color, also, was incredibly well done, and could be appreciated most in scenes like the one where Joe is taken to the hospital, when the walls and the doctors' uniforms are all starkly white, giving the messy, colorful Gideon the air of being out of place and too contrary to save.The actors did what they could with a script that was jumbled and confused. Gideon had incredible chemistry with all of the women he had to work with on the screen, excepting Jessica Lange as Angelique \u2013 his scenes with her seemed wooden and out of place. However, his chemistry with Leland Palmer, who plays his former wife; Erzsabet Foldi, his daughter; Cynd Charisse, his mistress; and Deborah Geffner as a one-night stand is all fantastic \u2013 and all four of them manage to hold their own in solo scenes or interactions with each other. Roy Scheider himself carries the entire movie, giving an impassioned and heart-wrenching performance as the destructive, lonely Joe Gideon which gives the movie most of its soul and, for me, most of its value.Far more messy in the way that it is told and the subject matter that it tries to cover than other musicals \u2013 \"Chicago\" comes to mind \u2013 \"All That Jazz\" is a movie that, I believe, could have lasting value for those who know enough about Bob Fosse to appreciate the story that it tries to tell and the nuances \u2013 such as his ritual of declaring, \"It's showtime, folks!\" to himself in the mirror every morning \u2013 that it covers. However, if you are like me and have no idea who Bob Fosse is or of the impact that he seems to have had on American musical theatre and film, then the movie might not do much for you. It'll probably even make you feel left out.",

Me, being a musical theater kid, was thrilled by this unexpected spectacle while my brother (who would rather sit through C-Span than watch a musical) calls it, to this day, his \"favorite\" musical (granted, not a long list).I've rewatched this film various times over the years and still liked it, but I hadn't checked it out for over 20 years at this point, so it was with some trepidation that I popped my DVD in (yes, I own the DVD, not the Blu-Ray) and sat back to see how well it holds up.And...I shouldn't have worried, for it holds up very, very well. Not only as a film, not only as a musical, not only as a look into the life and times (and style) of Bob Fosse, but also as a looking glass into the late 1970's.Written and Directed by famed Director/Choreographer Bob Fosse (CABARET, CHICAGO), ALL THAT JAZZ tells the (much more than) semi-autobiographical story of famed Director/Choreographer Joe Gideon (Scheider) who is pushing himself hard to finish a film and mount a Broadway show relying on booze, drugs and philandering.The performances are strong in this film with a bevy of \"Fosse regulars\" strutting their stuff. From Leland Palmer (in the obvious Gwen Verdon role) to Ann Reinking (in the Ann Reinking role) to Ben Vereen (as the variety show headliner from hell) they all bring strong Broadway credentials to the screen making the musical numbers a veritable showcase of Fosse movements.A very young Jessica Lange (in an early role that would showcase her acting chops) is mesmerizing, haunting and very, very watchable as a mysterious women in Joe's life while a very young John Lithgow shows up (and chews the scenery very, very well) as a rival director.The surprise to me, of course, was the strong performance of Scheider in the lead role. He was Oscar-nominated for his work (deservingly so) and when he finally steps into the big finale musical number, he shows that he can hold his own (surprisingly so). He is PERFECTLY cast as Joe Gideon and he never really approached this strong work again in his career.But, make no mistake about it, this film showcases Bob Fosse's Directing and Choreography skills - and they are excellent. The style of the film - bouncing from real life to something more ethereal - is strong, and strongly Fosse, giving a clear idea of the life and time in which these events unfold. I stated earlier that this film is a \"looking glass\" into the late 1970's, and I meant it. It immediately brought me back to those times - both the good and bad of it.The musical numbers are fascinating to watch with the dancing particularly stunning as the angles and forms that the dancers make with their bodies and arms and legs are a wonder to behold. There has never been anyone like Fosse (before or since) and it is GREAT to watch a showcase of his talents.This film was nominated for 9 Oscars - winning 4 - but losing Picture, Director (Fosse) and Actor (Scheider) to KRAMER vs. KRAMER (Picture, Director - Robert Benton and Actor - Dustin Hoffman). Now, I haven't seen Kramer vs. Kramer in a long, long time (probably not since I saw it in the theaters in 1979), but I gotta think ALL THAT JAZZ is better in all those categories.If you haven't seen this in awhile - or if you have NEVER seen it - check out ALL THAT JAZZ, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

The death sequence was especially tragic. The three most important women in his life beg him to live. Yet he has never built anything of substance to anchor him in their world. Ultimately, Gideon succumbs to his wandering ways and falls into the arms of the beautiful angel of death (a stunningly virginal Jessica Lange); ironically, becoming the seducee rather than the seducer. Gideon's death is proclaimed by two juxtaposed images. Image 1: Gideon gives into the charms of the angel of death and goes to her smiling.

The main focus is on a stage piece that Fosse is directing/choreographing, and this is littered with flash backs, and he seems to be guided by the ethereal Angelique (Jessica Lange), who is either simply an angel (as implied by her name), or some kind of guardian, who makes objective comments for his actions and desires. Fosse's alter-ego is Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), who is a hard drinking, chain smoking \"artist\", moving towards collapse.As we are privy to various flashes of his past, his womanising, and the consequences of these actions, we see him in the present, falling apart, his health deteriorating. Eventually he ends up in hospital, his loved ones around him, telling him essentially that they told him so. These sequences are played out in absolute fantasy. Song and dance numbers are played out by the people in his life in front of his hospital bed.In a brilliant scene whilst Joe is in hospital sees a board of producers sitting around a table discussing the finances of the show whilst Gideon is under the knife getting open heart surgery. What is great about the scene is the obvious dichotomy of creation and money. The juxtaposition of the meeting and the surgery, seem to imply that the discussions involved money seem to literally rip out the heart and soul of creativity. The film also has a visual chapter-head for each sequence involving a montage of Gideons morning ritual of Dexedrine, aspirin, eye drops, followed by his catch phrase, \"Show Time\", as he looks into the mirror.I'm not really much of a musical fan, but the fact that this focuses on an artist at breaking point, it's very 1970's downbeat attitude, and it's use of musical pieces placed firmly within fantasy, and dream context, makes it an endearing and exciting film. The closing number is particularly excellent, with its disco-like rendition (eulogy if you like) of The Everly Brothers' 'Bye Bye Love'. A fitting end to a seemingly incredible life, and a quite brilliant film. Bob Fosse did die shortly after the release of the film. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

If that sounds really weird, that's because it is. But as strange as the film is, it's also incredibly original, and I kind of loved it.Joe Gideon is self centered and a sex addict. He won't let anyone else love him because he hates himself. And he loves to hate himself. He's also an insane perfectionist. No scratches that. He's not just a perfectionist, no one can please him, not even himself. His goal seems to be to create something he considers perfect, but he can't help but hate everything he does. He doesn't seem to care much about his life, and the only thing he seems to think about is dance. We get a look into his mind and all we see is a lady that Joe thinks is perfect (and that we never see in his real life) and a stage. Oh, also, it becomes increasingly obvious that Joe is actually Bob Fosse, the director of this film.The film charts his sort of trip into insanity, and as he begins dieing, his life becomes more and more consumed by his dance numbers, until eventually he can't tell whats even real and what's fake. The show business and dance numbers eventually become his life, and before he can reach what he considers perfection, it cuts to his dead body.Speaking of the editing, it's absolutely fantastic throughout the whole film. It's fast and mirrors the way that the character feels, such as the morning routine. It starts with close ups of him showering, taking pills, eye drops etc... Then it cuts to a wide shot of Joe standing before he says \"It's show-time, folks!\". This shows how he is not truly himself until he has entered the show business, and also shows that he thinks about his life as just a show, a production. As the film progresses, it becomes harder for him to continue in his \"show\" and the editing reflects this. There are many clips quickly edited together of him coughing and trying to say \"It's show- time\" but he can't quite get it out. As well as a slow motion close up of him taking the pills, and many other fantastic editing moments, not only in this scene, but in the whole film. It connects past, present, future, memory, and fantasy with ease and it's amazing to watch.This also contains easily Roy Scheider's greatest performance. He becomes this suffering, lonely, self indulgent character and it blew me away. This film may be very strange, and as self indulgent as the main character, but its also really great and there's nothing quite like it.",

            "content": "This film takes the basic back story of the director Bob Fosse and distorts it into the story of its anti-hero, Joe Gideon.  The first, very cleverly put-together dance sequence, sees a group of dancers doing a Gideon routine to a blistering version of 'On Broadway'.  The film gets into gear with a number of Groundhog Day style repeats of Gideon popping pills and thinking 'Showtime!'.  Part fantasy, part difficult reality, we follow a number of sequences outside of and within Gideon's mind, culminating with a kind of surreal end of life sequence in which all the significant people in his life play out vignettes to show how they feel about him.The cornerstone of all this is Roy Scheider's performance, which is superb from first to last.  He's the one you remember, as the tired creative force pushing his last great idea into the world.  Lengthy but well worth the effort.",

            "content": "While I was watching All That Jazz, I was reminded of a quote that Howard Hawks said. Hawks said that in order to make a good movie, you must have 3 good scenes and no bad scenes. Bob Fosse's All That Jazz has, what I believe, three good scenes and no bad scenes. However, the move itself has a depressing mood to it, which is similar or not with Fosse's other works like Cabaret and Sweet Charity. The movie centers around a deeply troubled dance choreographer, (Roy Scheider), who spends most of his life dedicated to his work in the theater. Yet, outside his life, his wife, (Ann Reinking), and his daughter are seeing himself fall into a world of self-destruction. Scheider is trying to create a Broadway show called \"Airotica\", which will debuted in the beginning of February. Scheider's character is a drug addict and cigarette-smoking womanizer, who tries to do the best he can by putting on a show. But, as he begins to put the show together, his life starts to take a turn for the worse. Edited in between the movie are moments when Scheider speaks to an angelic woman, (Jessica Lange), about his troubles and his virtues.The movie is torn apart by its portrayal of a man that is not only falling under the spell of self-destruction, but also falling into a near-death experience. This creates the movie's depressing tone, yet it does make us feel bad that Scheider is hurting himself more and more as he feeds his life and heart into his production. Toward the end of the movie, without giving much more away, the main character finds exactly what he is looking for. Like most of Fosse's work, this movie centers around the dark side of show business. What Fosse shows us in this movie is his own vision of his life in the showbiz industry. We understand fully throughout the movie that for all of the razzle and dazzle specialty that this movie has to offer, there's a dark undercurrent lying underneath the movie. The three scenes that I think makes the movie worth watching are when Scheider shows his agents his idea of the show and he lets the female and male dance performers do the number, which is called \"Take Off with Us (Reprise). That scene is so energetic that as the scene went on with the dancers moving their bodies suggestively in the light and especially in the dark, I realize that Fosse's direction creates much of the scene's energetic mood. The movement of the hands. The way the female dancer move to the left and right of the room. The scene oozes with a sense of extreme sexuality that we get completely lost in a world that is showered by movement and energy. That is one of the three scenes that I like in the movie.The second scene that I like so much is when Scheider's lover and daughter dances in his apartment. The musical number in this scene is called \"Everything Old is New Again.\" I thought that of all of the scenes that were in the movie, this one was probably the best one in the movie. That scene is so well shot by Fosse and so well choreographed that it breaks through the depressing mood of the story. That's why the movie works for me. It has that ability to breaks through the depression and somehow feeds us a happy moment in the movie. Not only happy and jubilant, but also tragic. The third scene that I also like was when Scheider is shooting his own production number and like the scene that I mention before, his lover and his daughter also appear in this scene too. The wife and daughter do a number together, called \"After You've Gone\". The three scenes for me illustrates how much life and also feeling is being into this musical. Unlike Grease, which came out before this film, All That Jazz draws a tragic, downbeat and depressing tone to the musical genre. It also leaks sexuality since a lot of the numbers in this movie especially the rehearsal scene are very sexy.Roy Scheider give a outstanding performance as the main character. For a while, Scheider has been remembered as playing the police chief in Jaws or playing Gene Hackman's police partner in The French Connection. His performance make us want to care for him even though his response to the audience and to the supporting characters in the movie is ignored. This is a man who is walking on fire. He doesn't whether he makes it or not. I think what Bob Fosse shows us in this movie is that show business isn't about the stars and the razzle and dazzle. Showbiz can have a dark side, too. \u2605\u2605\u2605 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",

The dance routines were expertly performed - I especially liked the one that his daughter and one of his girlfriends did at the house.His wife still loved him despite his screwing around, and of course his daughter loved him unconditionally.

Nevertheless the story itself - life and death - catched me. All the years (40!) I had the feeling that I have seen a masterpiece on the TV, maybe. Something similar - so big as Kubrick's 2001, at least so significant regarding the being of life itself.Now, 2022, the movie was shown twice in Vienna's best cinema (Gartenbaukino). I had to go. To look after, is the feeling in me right?, seeing it once only, 40 years ago?It is! More than before. I am close to 60 now and not to die is not granted anymore. So this film got me into all the mixed feelings of dead, life, beauty and the huge importance of creating. Creating something is life itself. Life without creating is like being dead alive. And to die is the last show on earth. I hope I will be able to fantasize something appropriate in my last hours to peak before the lights are shut down.A movie that stays with me since decades. It is on my top ten movies list of all time. I do not think that a remake could outbid this classic. But, if I would be a director today, I would try it.

The best directing, the best acting, the best dancing, the best costume/set design, the best editing. I'm in awe of Bob Fosse and Roy Scheider, in fact, I think the latter was the best dramatic actor of them all, unfortunately trapped in a boxer's body and sentenced to straight-to-video action movies. I have seen many great film performances, but I have never been so touched by one. Joe Gideon, played by Roy Scheider, is not stricken by tragedy, is not a member of any minority group, doesn't fight for justice or survival and doesn't require prosthetic makeup. His tragedy stems from himself, he is his own undoing. But what drags him down is not his carelessness, it's his conscientiousness. He's a perfectionist. To achieve perfection, he needs a constant fuel of women, booze, cigarettes and Dexedrine. He grows as an artist, but never grows up. Or grows old. The film not only deals with death, it's the death of an artist. Quite a spectacle. The final scene is a masterpiece of cinema and religious art. It's the modern Transfiguration of Christ.\nI remember one critic writing that it's not clear what drives Joe Gideon. Clearly his art is his life. And his death. It could be confusing for an outsider looking in, but as the end credits roll over the plastic bag to the tune of There's No Business Like Show Business, every artist understands and shivers. Joe Gideon is not only Bob Fosse or Roy Scheider, he's all of us.\nLeland Palmer as Joe's ex wife, Ann Reinking as his girlfriend, Erzsebet Foldi as his young daughter and Jessica Lange as his angel of death give equally astounding performances. And so do all the dancers that appear in the opening scene and throughout the film. Ben Vereen, who finally hosts Joe's death, is funny, dark and electrifying. Ann Reinking's legs stretch from here to eternity and it's strange that she, Leland and Erzsebet didn't make another movie. Hollywood is sometimes only that much smart. And then, All That Jazz ended the era of musicals, because - who or what could top this? Fosse is God.",

The film's only fault may be it's slow pace, but anyone who understands the genre will most likely be able to forgive this draw back by concentrating on the shear depth of each scene and number.  The self-effacing Fossse biography, the detailed account of where the most influential choreographer/dancer since 1950 found his style and creativity, and the number \"Take off with us\" a piece which both encapsulates what Fosse had done until that point and at the same time manages to be fifteen years ahead of its time.  Arguably Fosse's best work, it combines his a-symetrical all at once dance style, with his favorite subject matter, sex, and a bit of reflection on what Fosse basically did to musicals taking fruity mindless tunes and making then deep, dark, and lurid.  The number was included in the Tony award winning Fosse, but without context or nudity it lost a lot of its edge. (It is worth mentioning that the number's choreography is heavily \"sampled\" in the music video for \"Thriller\" and is faithfully recreated in the music videos \"Cold Hearted Snake\" by Paula Abdul (who is evidently still alive) and \"What a girl Wants\" by Christina Aguillera.)  Roy Scheider is better than you could possibly imagine, or at least better than I could have imagined, as the Fosse charecter and a young Jessica Lange is perfect as Death.  All That Jazz will generate lively discussion for anyone who is fortunate enough to find a copy of it, from dance majors to complete amateurs, if for no other reason than the fact that it has the most morbid recreation of a pop song I have ever witnessed in its finalle.  The last time I saw this film it took me 3 months to find a copy on VHS, so I'm not kidding when I say its rare, but its definately worth going out of the way for.",

            "content": "1st watched 8/23/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Bob Fosse): Dark comedic musical about the downfall of a Broadway musical director written and directed by Bob Fosse is very well done for the most part. Roy Scheider plays the overworked, overmedicated, playboy director who just refuses to give less of himself to his work and his body can't deal with it. This is advertised as a musical, but it's more a portrayal of a man who really has no direction to go but down because of his refusal to change his way of life. He admits to his faults but just doesn't deal with it. He cheated on his ex-wife, doesn't give enough time to his daughter, cheats on his current girlfriend, and is majorly obsessed to giving everything to his work to these faults. This movie does exactly what it wants to do almost perfectly. The only flaw, in my opinion, is an overlong slightly corny ending number. Fosse choreographs the dancing numbers -- which there are plenty of -- but they complement the story rather than just being an addition. The beautiful Jessica Lange portrays death and is used throughout to help show what's going on inside Scheider's character and introduces the inevitable very early on. The movie could be considered depressing but it's all done tongue-in-cheek(almost laughing at itself because of the choice of the subject matter). The two hours fly by because of the way the director presents the main character and gets your interest in his life. Pieces are revealed as the story moves forward and by the end you get a complete picture of the man's life. This movie is so much more than a musical even though these parts aren't bad either --- it should be held in acclaim as one of the better of it's kind -- don't miss this one.",

For example, co-writer, subject, co-producer, director and choreographer Fosse produces an endless endling, overloaded with songs, dances and drama.\nRoy Scheider plays a brilliant and self-destructive theater & film director Fosse modeled after himself. The film's final death sequence goes on for 20 minutes or so; its many scenes are fascinating (\"8 1/2\"-ish) to look at, but too many to fully enjoy.\nThere's the operation to save \"Fosse\"; Ben Vareen's swarmy song and dance tribute to \"Fosse\"; \"Fosse\" the movie director shooting \"Fosse\" the patient; at least three separate dance numbers, each building on the other, as \"Fosse\" hallucinates others' commentaries on his life (with one number straight out of Busby Berkely). It goes on and on. Each is beautiful, perhaps a little too heavy with meaning, but always absorbing.\nLeading up to that, we see \"Fosse\" not so much juggling as diving in and diving out of relationships with his ex-wife, a new young lover, an long-time faithful lover, his new musical, his new movie and his pre-teen daughter. In between he rumages through his life with Jessica Lange, a beautiful, dressed-in-white angel of death.\nThe film portrays \"Fosse\" too simplistically: a creative genious and a failed, albeit charming, human being. Mere contradictions don't make for subtleties.\nBut its portrayal of show business's inner workings -- dance rehearsals, film editing, business dealings -- are totally absorbing. An oh-so-young John Lithgow's appearance as a director who might take over from \"Fosse\" oozes enough phony sincerety to grease a hundred frying pans.\nAnd throughout, the film has a rich visual style that ranges from appropriately glitzy to dream-like to straight dramatic.\nFinally, the dance numbers, specially staged for the camera, reveal that dance can be cinematic instead of static.\nThe brilliant dancing and musical scenes clearly override Fosse's instinct to overdo and overtell. This 19-year-old movie, even when seen on cable TV (in a letterboxed version) has more in it, and more to it, that all of today's over-budgeted, underfed blockblusers.",

            "content": "The history of cinema in the United States is characterized by the presence of numerous performing careers of promising and talented people who for various reasons left Hollywood much too soon. Dolores Hart retired to become a nun, while Peggy Dow chose to leave a promising movie future to marry and start a family. Often these situations were caused by the premature deaths of these gifted but sometimes troubled young people. This occasionally was the result of an accident (Russ Columbo, James Dean). More likely the deaths were connected with personal destructive lifestyle choices (River Phoenix, Wallace Reid, Laird Cregar, Mario Lanza, John Gilbert). Rarely, ill health might have produced the unexpected demise (Jean Harlow, Susan Ball). And commonly, some of these future potential immortal stars ended up a suicide (Olive Thomas, Barbara Bates, Maggie McNamara).To this sad list of film careers that never reached the full level of their early promise must now be added that of the greatly gifted youngster Erzsebet Foldi. At the remarkable age of 13, Liz or Lizzer (as she is now better known) performed her breakthrough role as Michelle---Roy Scheider's precocious daughter in the landmark musical All That Jazz (ATJ). Acting and dancing at a standard that well exceeded her actual age and molded under the expert direction of the brilliant Bob Fosse, Foldi proved to be an astonishing and welcome surprise that greatly contributed to ATJ's enduring success. Her sparkling ATJ dance duets with Ann Reinking were inspired, memorable and entertaining. Foldi was so sweet, charming and charismatic that most viewers just could not get enough of her.So whatever happened to Erzsebet Foldi? Alas---she never appeared in another major musical film. Her career proceeded with spurts and stops, punctuated by a stint with Twyla Tharp and attendance at New York University (where she graduated from its Tisch program). Somewhere along the line, she became a Born Again Christian, a licensed massage therapist, a resident of Phoenix, Arizona and a longtime friend of her ATJ collaborator Ann Reinking (who sadly died at the age of 71 in 2020). The two of them appeared in a remarkable documentary (made in 2014 and currently available on YouTube) that touches on their respective careers, ATJ and their muse---the incomparable Bob Fosse.Foldi is reputed to have competed for the role of Emmaline in The Blue Lagoon (it went to Brooke Shields), and also made an isolated television appearance in a 1993 episode of the This Is Your Life tribute to Roy Scheider.. But her show business career essentially ended before it ever had a chance to really begin.From all the available evidence, Foldi today is a happy and well grounded middle-aged person living what might be considered to be an ordinary uneventful life. However, her exceptional work in ATJ suggested that there was so much more to come from her. It must now be included in the voluminous Hollywood catalogue of things \"that might have been.\"",

            "content": "Okay. I'm on a roll. I was so irritated by the first movie I went to see today (day off - Tammy) that I had to write a review. Then I followed it by a review of another current movie out which I loved (Maleficent), which brings me to my all time favorite movie, All That Jazz, and I promise you, after I get done with with this one, I will pack it in for the night until something else sends me over the edge. This is a film that never ever fails to disappoint. I think I've seen it maybe - at last count - and still counting - 20 twenty times. This movie holds up so well, so beautifully, it gets me every time and every time I am just as moved and taken as I was when I first saw it. Roy Scheider is brilliant, but he's nothing compared to Ann Reinking or Leland Palmer. I could sit and watch this movie without sound, the costumes that Wolsky did are so superb and spectacular, if you've never seen this movie again, don't read another word and watch it. It's the most classic of all classic Bob Fosse, with a sense of what is waiting for him that makes one want to believe in something more. The dance number - and no, this is not a spoiler and won't ruin it - is the number between Ann and the kid. Tell me you can see that just once. When I've had a bad day and don't know what's next, I YouTube that and everything is right in the world again. Again, I'm not going to offer any spoilers, but the movie only gets better with time and a frequent number of viewings. Jessica Lange never looked better. In fact, I'm not sure if any of them ever looked better and this movie - not any of the others - is what made me fall head over heels in LOVE with Bob Fosse. If you love dance, movement, relationship s**t, self realization, good writing - no great, writing, introspection, creativity - please see this movie and get back to me. I actually judge people on whether or not they got it, it's so good and worthy of anything I could possibly say. Okay. I hated Tammy with a passion. I hated the people that put that s**t out into the world,so I just made up for it by writing two review on movies that offer redemption for all the crap that's out there. You do have to have an IQ over 140 to really get this movie, though, so don't blame me if you watch and leave, saying, \"Huh?\" If that's what happens to you, go back to the farting fat jokes.",

For those philistines of us who can barely put one foot in front of another, we know him best from \"Cabaret\" or \"Chicago\"; but of course, he had many other excellent productions to his name. The movie is a sort of Roman a Clef to his life and production.Bob Fosse would die some 71/2 years after this move was made at the relatively young age of 60, dying from excess pill popping, booze, and overwork. All graphically depicted in the move. The movie shows him, like so many actors, superannuated and in love with himself, which saves the viewer any anguish over not loving a not loveable character. I find severely limited the charms of drunks, druggies, and the self-indulgent. But hey, that's me.The movies excellent songs and dance numbers make the sum of the parts an excellent whole. For all the self-destruction that was Fosse, the production is lively and vibrant. Of especial note is Ann Reinking (who only died in the Fall of 2020 at age 70) dancing with Erzsebet Foldi as Fosse's daughter (with his wife Gwen Verdon), dancing to the song: \"Everything that is Old is New Again.\" (Note how \"Thanks to the Memories\" sung by Bob Hope and Shirly Ross elevates a forgettable movie. Or Ann Southern singing \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" elevated a forgettable movie.)The geniuses out there need to be reminded that before their genius is recognized with a production reflecting that genius, they are likely to be dead from booze or pills or drugs. Fosse was fortunate that he managed to live long enough to have his genius realized in artistic format.",

On the DVD that came out in 2001, Roy Schieder narrates what it was like playing and working as/with Bob Fosse.

The film combines musical theatre elements in a surprising way to the story, creating nice rhythm to the structure of the film (although I might have liked to see them having more function dramaturgically). Roy Schneider does convincing job in the role of choreographer and director Joe Gideon. Those are some of the merits of this Palme d'or winner of 1980.The problem of the film is that we see the story entirely through the main characters eyes. Joe Gideon is a strong male character who dominates his lovers and subordinates with ruthless and reckless behaviour. Joe is a traditional character of a \"suffering male artist\" and is the reason why this film unfortunately has not lasted the test of time. Especially after the revelations of #metoo-movement inside the show business, some moments in the film are very unpleasant to watch. The film doesn't criticize the awfulness of the main characters behavior sufficiently and does not give enough voice for the victims. We do see Joe Gideon regretting his deeds to some extent, but the story falls flat and we do not see Joe treated the equal way compared to the way he has treated other people. This is at least what I interpreted the film is trying to do to some extent and it fails. It does feel like the main character has written and directed the movie himself... which in a way he has since the main character is based on Fosse himself (who wrote the script with Robert Alan Aurthur).From Fosses works I would recommend first and foremost Cabaret, in which we can enjoy the legendary directors skillset in a musical theatre context without the outdated narrow masculine point of view All That Jazz unfortunately has.",

He creates a neurotic character almost predestined for destruction the moment the movie begins.The film is shot so cohesively and so well that it puts you fully into Gideon's mind and provides a door into a man's subconscious in a way that almost no other film does (notable exceptions include Captain Willard in Apocalypse Now!) It is nearly impossible to consider this film as a musical, because the narrative qualities counterbalance the overall story so effectively that it transcends all the clich\u00e9s and trends of the musical. The film also has what I consider to be the best ending of any film I have ever seen.

His work is perfectly underscored by Leland Palmer as Audrey Paris, the ex-wife star of the show within the show; Ann Reinking as Kate Jagger, the long-suffering girlfriend; Erzsebet Foldi as daughter Michelle; and Jessica Lange as the Grim Reaper.

But heck, this was 1979 and even stilted choreography involving two mostly naked men was pretty amazing stuff to my young eyes.And there were women who represented as lesbians.

I wanted to forever be a witness to the greatness that was and is Ann Reinking.  I wanted to marvel at the strange thing that is Jessica Lange's nose (Fosse wisely does not hide this anomaly).

Ronald Reagan was clearly going to beat Jimmy Carter, who had failed for what seemed like forever to solve the Iran Hostage Crisis. I saw the movie four times. It was a good date movie. You could talk about it afterward, since the themes were major - Love, Death, Art. Comic (a la Lenny Bruce, speaking of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' On Death and Dying) : \"This chick, man, without the sole benefit of dying herself, has broken down the process of dying into five stages: anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Sounds like a Jewish law firm. 'Good morning, Angerdenialbargainingdepressionacceptance!'\". Joe Gideon (Bob Fosse as played by Roy Scheider) : \"No, nothing I ever do is good enough. Not beautiful enough, it's not funny enough, it's not deep enough, it's not anything enough. Now, when I see a rose, that's perfect. I mean, that's perfect. I want to look up to God and say, 'How the hell did you do that? And why the hell can't I do that?'\" Angelique (Jessica Lange as the Angel of Death): \"Now that's probably one of your better con lines.\" Joe Gideon : \"Yeah, it is. But that doesn't mean I don't mean it.\"Gideon's perfectionism almost means more to him than love, to ironic effect. When Joe's girlfriend, Kate - played by Fosse's own girlfriend, Ann Reinking - blasts a perfect line at him, he wanders away, argument forgotten. \"That's a good line,\" he says. \"I can use that line.\" Critics of the day tended to pan All That Jazz, condemning Fosse's roman a clef as a self-indulgent and self-serving ego trip. But then Fosse's movie had already dealt with scathing critics. From his hospital bed Joe Gideon watches a television critic, played by Cris Chase, pan The Sand-Up, the movie's stand-in for Fosse's Lenny. Critic : \"The Stand Up does not stand up. Leaning toward the frenetic, Gideon falls into his characteristic of trying too hard to please, to entertain. Slickness obscures reality, the old razzle-dazzle sometimes obliterates drama. In his effort to keep The Stand Up upright, Gideon has resorted to the use of crutches: frantic cutting, an earsplitting soundtrack, chopping off the ends of scenes before the drama is played out...\"Nobody knew Fosse's weaknesses, egotism included, any better than Fosse himself. Certainly, now that Fosse has been dead since September 23, 1987, the critic's cavils against Fosse's apology for his mad life and dark art do not matter.Like life, All That Jazz is a great movie. ...Tom McClellan Dallas, Texas +++",

            "content": "All That Jazz is one of the worst films I've ever seen! First of all; the opening scene goes on for a lifetime. We understand that they dance and that They are hard working dance students. Second; Roy is ugly as hell and cannot act at all. You do not believe that he is a showbiz man for a second. The film is approx. 2 and a half hours but it feels like 12. I saw it on cable one night and will never ever forget that night. I still had to buy it the other day on DVD, just to see it again, and oh my god I was taken back to that night of hell once again. Now I use to lend the DVD to friends just to make their lives miserable. Finally, the music is so bad that you need to listen to good music for hours afterwords just to stay sane.",

            "content": "I saw this movie in its original theatrical release and last night on Fox Movie Channel. Roy Scheider was my favorite actor in the 70's and I loved dance, even saw the road show of Dancin' in Philadelphia. At that time, the comments the female dancers made about about Joe Gideon in the beginning of the film, \"I slept with him and still didn't get the part.\" were all too familiar to me from the 70's dating scene. But, what struck me as positive was how he brought out the best in his dancers and actors. The scene that best exemplified this was when he said to Victoria, \"I can't make you a great dancer but I can make you a better dancer.\" Another director knowing her as he did may not have harassed her during rehearsal but then may not have have encouraged her to dance better. Soon after viewing the film, I got a job in a whole new field. Some things I never mastered but I did get better. When I returned to my original field, I could apply unique skills to new responsibilities. Then, I became great!",

            "content": "When this movie came out in 1979, it made a SENSATION. It generated a lot of debate: was it a self-indulgent pity-party that Bob Fosse threw for himself? Was it a scathing commentary on the business of entertainment? Was it a brilliant metaphor for for....something? Was it Fosse's payback for perceived injustices? Was it brilliant? Was it overdone? How much of Joe Gideon, the central character, represented Fosse's view of himself? It seemed to me that a lot of the reviews that were done at the time were more about the reviewer's erudition and knowledge of the minutiae of Fosse's career, and personal life, and the insider references in the film than about whether the movie was worth the cost of admission and the time out of your life to go see it.So that's how I want to address this movie: from the point of view of someone who is wondering if it's a good movie for entertainment.The answer is yes, but a very reluctant, qualified yes, with a warning that towards the end, the pace of the movie bogs down and it loses its narrative quality. If you're looking for a movie that maintains narrative momentum from beginning to end, that tells a story straightforwardly and without getting artsy, this is NOT a movie you're going to enjoy.Don't get me wrong: there are things about this movie that I loved as much as anything I've ever seen in a movie. If you love to watch dancing, if you're a fan of Fosse the choreographer, even if you just find it interesting to see the human body used as an interpretive vehicle through dance, this is a MUST-SEE movie. Leland Palmer as Joe Gideon's ex-wife, Anne Reinking as Joe Gideon's main girlfriend, are AWESOME dancers. Oh my god, what would it be like to be able to dance like that? The \"Take off With Us\" dance (sometimes referred to as the \"airotica\" dance) was groundbreaking and amazing. A \"must-see\" if you love musical dance numbers. The dancing and choreography are superlative. No doubt about it, if you love dance, this movie has something for you.The movie moves along smartly early on: the characters are engaging, you get hooked into wondering if the play and movie that Joe Gideon is working on are going to be successful, and you wonder about his relationships with his ex-wife, with Anne Reinking as his girlfriend Kate Jagger, even his relationship with dancer Victoria (Deborah Geffner). The movie is hard to fault in establishing the relationships and the tension about the projects Gideon is working on.Where it bogs down: when Gideon starts to have his heart trouble, and the movie disintegrates into metaphorical dance numbers and a really totally jarring open-heart surgery segment. Warning: if you are squeamish, this part of the movie will disturb you. If you're watching this on DVD or TiVo, this is where you will be grateful for the fast-forward button.At this point, the dance and musical numbers don't move the movie forward, in my opinion. They bog it down. It's all very metaphorical, and very artistic, and the dancing is good, but it is SLOOOOOWWWWWWWWW. It really screws up the pace of the movie. For me, that's the biggest flaw this movie has. Up until the heart attack hospital sequences, the movie flows smoothly. When it gets to this point, I find myself getting bored and wondering why it's dragging on so long.I also have a certain amount of ambivalence about the device of using Jessica Lange as a personification of Death. The device works early in the film, not so well towards the end, at least in my opinion. There's a point where it becomes melodramatic.So do I recommend this movie? I do, with reservations. If you're a Bob Fosse fan, it's a must-see. If you enjoy dancing, it's a must-see. If you're looking for a movie with a straightforward plot that moves smoothly along from beginning to end, you're probably going to be disappointed, because the movie is going to bog down and go on too long at the end. That's a serious flaw, all the more glaring because the first part of the movie is so good.Wish I could give it a stronger recommendation, but there it is: from a purely entertainment standpoint, it bogs down and loses steam at the end.",

But that's exactly what this does, and it's Fosse's intention to have us in a standing ovation as his lead character flatlines.It's audacious, cruel, arousing, and exciting, words that could describe Fosse's entire career on stage and screen. That's why this film is the perfect encapsulation of the man, his career, and his own fears about what he would leave behind.",

And that's \"showtime folks.\" It is clever, introspective, self-deprecating and compassionate. As a piece of theatre, it's remarkable. You are drawn into the internal life of the main character in a rare manner, and then, like him - forced to externalise again. A wonderful introspective piece that delivers big numbers, asks big questions, then leaves the answers to ephemeral, gentle Southern ladies with very big white hats!",
