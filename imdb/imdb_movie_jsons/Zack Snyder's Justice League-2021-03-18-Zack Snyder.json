{"rating": 0.0, "release_date": "2021-03-18", "num_reviews": 8082, "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy"], "summary": "N/A", "A huge improvement over the 2017 cut": "I don't want to discuss the Machiavellian machinations that led to the butchery cut from 2017 and then to this one seeing the light of day - suffice to say that I am not hopeful for the future - yet I am grateful for them leading to me getting to see Zack Snyder's cut. Other than being way too long, it was a pretty perfect film. It would have been a much better business decision to split it into two films and getting twice the money from cinemas than to cut and reshoot it into stupidity.After watching this cut I knew why things happened, what the motivations of the characters were, including the villains, Superman's lip didn't make me cringe, new characters and story ideas have been introduced and I am hopeful for the DC Universe for the first time in a long time. Easter Eggs galore! And it also had a nice end scene that foreshadowed a possible continuation, but also gave enough so you understand what it could have been even if no film is being made of it. It's not a one minute Marvel post credit scene, it's a full on subplot about the future. Hell, it made me want to see more of Jared Leto!Is it perfect? No. There were some scenes that I would have gladly had edited out: people bursting in song like in a Bolly film, people climbing stairs, Lois Lane talking to Clark's mom, Lois Lane talking to a random street cop, Lois Lane standing still thinking, etc. The character of Cyborg's dad was also weak, even if I really like the actor.Bottom line: I thought that the 2017 cut had a bunch of characters that were not explored or otherwise pointless. The Snyder cut fixes all of that and adds meaning to everything everybody does. It's not mindless fun like the 2017, but has a shape and a place in the world and would have given me hope in the DC Universe if I didn't know only AT&T's desperation brought it to light.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League": "Pure brilliance. Loved every minute of it. The best part of all this is the cry babies of the MCU fans. They are forced a joke comedy hero movie. Snyder gives us films with real emotions. He has funny parts too but they aren't forced. Good Job Snyder. Restore The Snyder Verse.", "It leaves you asking for more!": "Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize.\nHonestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film.", "This is the Justice League movie we deserve": "This epic 4 hour event was phenomenal. What Snyder did was give the characters true depth. There is heart within this movie. The villains a truly to be feared compared to 2017. The story and the highlight of Cyborgs journey is amazing. We HAVE TO HAVE MORE!", "Wow... so much better than the one that went to theaters": "Zach Snyder's original version is 1000 x's better than the one Joss Whedon put in theaters. DC made a huge mistake not trusting Synder.", "Long, but worth it.": "Zack Snyder's Justice league is an excellent movie. It is however 4 hours long. And I never got bored watching any of it. It's a masterpiece and testament to Synder's vision for his movie that we should have gotten to see back in 2017. He fixed the problems with Justice League (2017) and improved upon them, must watch for any comic book fan.", "Incredible, far better than previous cut": "Zack snyder's justice league is far better than theatrical cut, in every way you can think of, steppenwolf is an actual threat now, his cgi is great, he has a clear goal, but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters, Snyder did each hero justice, and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing, Wonder woman is nothing like what we've seen in ww84, she is a valiant warrior and badass character, I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2, he is an absolute great villain, and junkie xl music is really epic and great, overall 9/10 for this movie, I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motions\nNOW, it's time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE", "I'm glad that they found a way to resurrect this superhero film": "While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films.", "Felt literal goosebumps.": "No words can describe the experience. Seeing all the struggle come into life makes it amazing. Hundred times better than the theatrical cut.", "The superhero collaboration movie should be atleast 3 hours long": "The longer they are, the more time they get to set up the story The pace is perfect The stories of each character is perfectly timed Nothing feels rushed and the dark theme just ups the game Justice has finally been done to the reputation of justice league", "Much Better Movie": "This version is so much better than the originally released movie. At first, I didn't understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released, but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didn't add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League, go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original.", "Superheroes Unite!": "Yesss, thank you Zack Snyder!\nTHIS is the movie the DC heroes deserved...\nAnd the fans as well!It's an amazing continuation on \"Man Of Steel\" and \"Batman V Superman\" and the story is splendid this way. Character arcs, worldbuilding, awesome effects...\nNote to Warner Bros: let Snyder continue this franchise.\nHe really knows what he's doing!", "ALL HAIL ZACK SNYDER": "The original film was 2 hours long, this version comes in at 4 hours!From start to finish the film is literary a new film with more story, more action, more everything!Epic, amazing and can't wait for the sequel!4 years of wait finally ended...", "4 Stars for 4 Hours of Average.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League, retells the story of reviving superman and uniting heroes in one team to defend the planet from an ancient off the world evil, Darkseid.The whole movie is focused on the fight between the JL and Darkseid henchman, Steppenwolf. Yet it still have some good fight scenes aside from the huge number of goofs that you can spot left and right from the get go...you can simply - spot the fake gun silencer falling down while the terrorist at the beginning of the movie moves his hand - and this is the LEAST to say about the amount of goofs and silly spotted mistake allover the place with no spoilers.Let's talk technicalities without mentioning many details, The casting choices...I know this won't \"stay down\" for most but I'll say it as it is...Clearly they are settled for some weird reason with their casting choices but this is for them to troll the real fans with and for me not to watch, Superman I believe is a good choice, batman well he's \"OK\" (although I believe superman can be adjusted in the post production to look TALLER than Bruce Wayne but hey this is just me) but seriously Wonder woman ?! No blue eyed, let's just say \"well built\" actress out there ? I'll leave it at that and I bet comics fans get my drift, a short flash ?! I don't care how tall is the actor in real life but the bad directing and ugly cinematography makes him look way shorter than the others in almost all scenes. It's not a huge deal but an eyesore for true fans. But when it comes to Lex Luthor and the Joker casting well...this is what I call a sad joke! The DC casting generally nowadays is sad and all over the place! It's like the decision makers for the movies are teen girls!... From casting of the suicide squad to justice league not to mention the casting for the upcoming batman which is a laughable joke to say the least. But hey this is for them to screw up and for me to either not watch or free stream at best! \"Not Worth A Penny\".The story is a bit off at various points along the movie, the plot is very linear...a problem present itself then gets solved right away, every step is very convenient like it was written for children only. You can feel that the director is trying very hard to come up with a Very different version from the original but failing to stand out in my opinion. He tries so by mainly shoving more characters that fans like with no regards to their role or reason to exist in the movie.The CGI is good at moments, silly and laughable at others and a big WOW when it comes to the extremely stupid adaptation of the Flash! The Character itself, is Not the nerdy scientist guy we know, the lines makes him pretty much a stupid drunk person with nothing useful to add! The CGI is laughable and fails to show a proper mechanism of the Flash. It made me feel like he's swimming and sometimes jumping long distances in a puddle of goo! Not running super fast at all, even with the comics logic when flash moves in hyper speed his surroundings slows down but this does NOT means he slows down as well ! He should either move in a speed relative to our normal perspective or even faster but clearly the director lacks the brains that he force slow motion in every flash close up that we completely thrown off the concept of the character superpower.The so called \"Aquaman\", aside from the obvious \"ugly\" casting choice, most of his late fight scenes are WAY WAYYYY off. There's NO water in the surroundings, why do the filmmakers shove him in the fight scene jumping/flying around like a male wonder woman! Seriously wtf.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a mindless Ok to watch flick and may be enjoyable for some if you can spare 4 hours to kill without literally having anything else to watch. But far from standing out on any level.", "Wow!": "This is the best comic book film I have ever seen!", "Great art": "The story of \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman vs. Superman\" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and it's perfect. Character buildup, plot, humor, climax, emotions in the movie is so great. It's a sight for sore eyes.", "8": "It was the longest movie that I've seen in my entire life. Despite being 4 hours length it didn't feel like that, all that time just flew away. That's main point which shows that this film was interesting to watch. I've seen first Justice League and now seeing this I can see some similarities but there are more differences in a good way. I've enjoyed plot, it was easy to follow, interesting to watch, it kept your attention whole time. Can't say a lot about acting it was on point, really good, main actors did great job (yeah, there are some awkward scenes but just few). The main concern I have is effects. As a viewer I saw that there was a lot of slow-mo or speed- up scenes to make CGI smooth (that's my guess) but that just made some scenes less realistic. I really admire some special effects, colors and details but some scenes have major problems. I would say this movie deserves about 7.3-7.4/10 but, as this is the best film, that I've seen, so far in this year, I raised my mark to 8. I would encourage to watch this movie for comics, DC or even Marvel fans because it's really good.", "please continue...": "This movie is significantly higher quality. Almost everything they took out was for the better. Almost every change was for the better. The story makes sense. There are legitimate characters with arcs and everything. The visuals were beautiful, the music was beastly. And it is TRULY epic.The only reason i didn't give this a higher score is because, simply put, it's too long. I was never bored. And i always advocate for the artists (directors) creating art without studio interference. But while the original justice league is one end of the spectrum with studio interference up the butt, this seems like the other end, where the director is a bit overindulgent. Many of the scenes were completely unnecessary to the story and some even felt like deleted scenes from a dvd extra.Again, i was not bored, but rewatchability comes into play when i rate. I definitely want to watch this again, but the 4 hour runtime will significantly reduce repeat viewings. Somewhere in here, there is a 3 hour and 15 minute perfect cut which i would rate 8/10. (1 viewing, 3/21/2021)\nSPOILERS\nIn the original the, the mother boxes were just a useless MacGuffin that I didn't care about, now the mother boxes are actually a huge part of the story. In the original the villain was the most bland cookie cutter villain ever, now I actually knew why he was doing what he was doing. In the original they took Superman to General zod's ship to revive him with the mother box and none of that made sense to me but I just went with it and didn't ask questions. Now it makes way more sensethe scenes i imagine should be taken out are some of the scenes with martha and lois, the martian manhunter stuff, and some of the epilogue. I thought the epilogue was cool, but it was out of place here. And it makes it worse if they're not continuing this storyline, which as of now they are not.", "Much More Nuanced & Dynamic & Rich Version": "-Zack Snyder's Justice League is everything we hoped for \u2764\ud83d\udc4c\n-Now it's safe to say that Restoring The Snyderverse is a necessity \ud83d\udd25\n-Much more Mature & Dynamic & Rich Experience through Well driven characters , Engaging Storytelling , Exciting Journey with Shocking Turns , Satisfying Conclusions , Promising potentials to invest in \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f\nwhich makes it a much more overwhelming Version \ud83d\udc4c\u2764\nCompelling & Balanced Pacing \ud83d\udcc8-Much vaster Space for characters to develop & Grow \ud83d\udcc8\n-Convincing & Profound Depiction of the Antagonists , Explaining Their Goals & Diving in their conflicts\n-Shocking Turns , Exciting Revelations and Satisfying surprises \u2764\ud83d\udca5 That kept the level Of Focus and Anticipating and Paved the upcoming Sequences \ud83d\udd25\n-Great characters Direction through Highlighting the most interesting Aspects of the characters who have come a long way in their ascending journey , the thing that Helped showing how much they developed so far\n-This Version Provides Steppenwolf With Clear & Compelling Motivations That make him try to achieve His goal Which is To prove himself again and seek Redemption and redeeming for the Mistakes that he commited\n-It sets many things right this time\n-Great Character Arcs for most of the characters Such As Cyborg , Flash , Aquaman , Batman \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc4c\n-Zack Snyder Said that Cyborg is The Heart of his movie , and he was Totally Right , Victor Stone's Was a very well Written Character with Many interesting Aspects and Layers in his complex Personnality and An Impactful & Heartbreaking Backstory that was full of Struggles and Challenges\n-Great Action Sequences\n-Profound & Rooting Dialogues along the Movie-Very well Polished Visual Effects\n-Interesting Choice of Soundtracks & Musics that did a heck of a job accompanying & rooting the Events \ud83c\udfb6\n-Astonishing & Fascinating Cinematography \ud83d\udcfd\ud83d\ude0d\n-Amazing Color Grading \u2764\ud83d\udc4c\n-The Final conclusion left us with Many Promising Ideas & Storylines to be Told\n-Personally Part 3 \"Beloved Mother , Beloved Son \" , Part 4 \"Changing Machine \" Part 6 \"Something Darker\" Were my favorite parts through the Movie\n-I can't Believe That we've been deprived Of this Work of Art for About 3,5 years and I feel Sorry for the wasted Opportunities Of the DCEU\nAnd Hopefully Warner Bros will Make up and Rectify the previous mistakes and Disappointments and Rise with The DCEU and finally Reconcile with Fans\n-My Movie Rating : 9/10 \u2705\ud83d\udc4d", "Awesome movie.": "I loved the movie from the beggining to the end.Just like Ray fisher said,I was hoping that the movie doesn't end.

You can tell the difference of when a director respects the characters given to him; every single one of these heroes was a joke in whedon's cut especially batman and cyborg but zack gave batman and everyone else the respect they deserve. the only flaw is that it ended, thank you snyder for this universe and thank you to all the fans who made it possible", "So Snyder's Cut": "Most Critics said that there is no difference between this version and that whedon crap version , but yet we know where's that opinions come from.\nSnyder's Cut was complete and more believable than the whedon version and more importantly the last three sequences first the last fight with flash back in time , second one luther breakout from arkham and the unique one \"The Nightmare\" and when i saw LETO as joker that's far from what i saw in suicide squad crap , brilliant job done from snyder because he pull that acting from leto and that's where a real director can show the QUALITYlast word : i'm gonna wait for JL 2 yeah i'm gonna wait ....", "This was so good from beginning to end and had a nice pace between storyline and action scenes.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) is a movie the Mrs. And I watched the night it was released to HBOMax...the entire 4 hours. Man we loved it. The storyline focuses on a premonition given to Batman that tells him a world conqueror is on its way to Earth and he needs to assemble some rumored and identify companions to face the invader. Follow his crusade while meanwhile, the world conquerors minions have already arrived to Earth and set the stage for an epic showdown. This movie is directed by Zack Snyder (300) and stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Ben Affleck (Gone Girl), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Amy Adams (Doubt), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers) and Diane Lane (The Outsiders). My description does not do the storyline justice. The execution of the villain and how impactful he was as a foe was excellent. We loved Steppenwolf. The vastness of the Amazonian island in the opening sequence was a great kickoff to the movie. I liked how Aquaman was portrayed in this version as well as the ripple-effect of losing Superman, for his family as well as to the overall planet. This was so good from beginning to end and had a nice pace between storyline and action scenes. We are fortunate Snyder came back and gave us this version and this is one of my favorite super hero moves I have seen in some time. This is almost a perfect film that I'd score a 9.5/10.", "Overlong and unnecessary": "If I had to describe ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE in one word, it'd be \"tiring.\" By the end of this four-hour-long saga (yes, you read that correctly), I just wanted to take a nice long nap and give myself a break from the constant CGI battles, overuse of slow motion, and all-over-the-place storyline.Am I saying the Snyder Cut is a bad movie? No, of course not. This film is still miles better than the Frankenstein's monster of ideas that was 2017's JUSTICE LEAGUE. Snyder directs this movie with his typical stylistic and over-dramatic eye, and many scenes would have fallen flat with somebody else behind the camera. The storylines of Cyborg and The Flash are also much stronger here, and both characters are far more interesting as a result. However, I still don't think the movie ever justifies its existence other than satisfying the fans who have been clamoring for it on Twitter.Much of the flaws of the 2017 version are still here -- some of which have even been boosted by the four-hour runtime. The plot still feels incredibly disjointed and messy: the story finally comes together with one coherent goal about 3/4 through the movie, and by then I was just waiting for it to end. Somehow, I felt as though nothing really happened throughout this movie other than setup for future projects, which is quite infuriating given both the overlong runtime and the long-standing hype. The writing is also really tacky at times, with certain stone-cold serious lines making me laugh out loud (Wonder Woman saying to a little girl who just survived a terrorist bombing \"You can be anything you want to be\").I feel bad for raining on everyone's parade, but it was difficult for me to get through this. I still see the objective value in Snyder making this and attempting to right the wrong that was done to his film by Warner Bros. In 2017, but I don't think it amounted to all that much. C.", "The Best Comic Book Movie of All Time": "I love Steppenwolf's design and CGI. Steppenwolf fighting the Amazons was epic. Love Batfleck's role as the recruiter. Willem Dafoe is always awesome at whatever character he portrays. Love the scene where Ezra saves Iris, it was really bomb, almost magical, I don't know why many people hate it. The music, the slow motion, the visual effects, the performances, amazing. Watching Cyborg watching the kids playing football is so sad. Victor's story is so tragic. This line from Ezra to Batfleck had me lmao ''Uh yeah, I do competitive ice dancing''. Ezra: What are your superpowers again? Batfleck: Im rich. Me: LMAO.Alfred's advice on how to make tea is top-notch. Gordon: How many of you are there? Batfleck: not enough. Another great line. Love Jeremy Iron's portrayal of Alfred, my only (small) complain is that he looks a bit young to be Alfred. Steppenwolf's dialogue is really good, not even a moment of cringe. Wonder Woman: ''Hate is Useless'', love this line. Barry and Clark fighting in superspeed was beyond awesome. I really enjoy all the visual effects for the Flash in this movie. Victor's dad's death was tragic, Victor has lost so much. Wow love the way that we can hear both of Clark's fathers talking while he is wearing the black suit for the first time.The visual effects for that scene towards the end where Barry is running were surreal. All the fight scenes in this movie were epic and really satisfying. Love how they took their time to develop each character. It's so sad that the original release of the Justice League (2017) was exremely bad. This should have been released instead. Seeing Lex, Deathstroke, Joker and Martian Manhunter made me really happy. Amazing performances overall. Great writing, direction and cinematography. This is the best comic book movie of all time in my opinion. My rating is 9.5/10.", "Finally, it's been set straight": "Gonna keep this short. It was worth the wait, despite the DCU's cinematic history and it's inferior \"Josstice League\". It's 4 hour runtime wisps by with its perfect pacing and attention to detail. This is definitely the definitive verison and Zack Snyders vision as intended. 10/10.", "\"There is no us without him.\"": "If you know the history of this film, you'll know it's not a sequel to 2017's \"Justice League\", but more a replacement of it. At four hours, double the run time of the earlier picture, it delves more deeply into the back stories of The Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg/Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), which is commendable, since they didn't get their own full treatments like Wonder Woman and Aquaman. The story here revolves around the the three mother boxes that the main villain Steppenwolf seeks to bring together to usher in the Unity, which would bring about the destruction of the planet. If you grew up a DC comic book fan in the Sixties, you would take the formation of the Justice League to have occurred among super-hero friends who all knew each other, so it was a bit of a disconnect for me to see how tough a job it was for Batman (Ben Affleck) to get some of the others to join him in his mission. Also, with Steppenwolf reporting to two masters, both DeSaad and Darkseid, you had to wonder at times why Darkseid himself wouldn't just step in to do all of his own dirty work instead of relying on intermediaries. The comic book stories take the time to drag out all these relationships over time, but in a compressed format, even if four hours, it just makes me wonder. I had to wonder too, why Steppenwolf made such a big deal about locating the third mother box on Earth. After all, the second mother box was also located on Earth, just under the ocean in Aquaman's realm. It would have been preferable I think for Superman (Henry Cavill) to have a larger role in the story, though his reuniting with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and his mother (Diane Lane) allowed for some poignant moments that offered some of the best dialog in the picture. Ultimately, the Zack Snyder cut offers an epic story line that fans can enjoy in chapter segments if the four hour run time proves a bit antsy, giving fans what they missed out on in the earlier version.", "One of the greatest comic book movies ever !": "The Snyder cut gave us an explanation to the story and to why is steppenwolf gathering the mother boxes and cyborg backstory and these two thing are the most important things that the original cut missed and what's even better that they removed all the silly jokes that was in the original movie\nPositives:\nEvery character took his right(main characters) , a better Batman, a more powerful steppenwolf with a purpose, the cgi has been improved and so much better than the original one , the soundtrack was amazing especially the wonder women one and the most positive thing is the fighting scenes\nNegatives:\nToo much slow motions\nMy top 5 scenes\n1-joker and the Batman dialogue\n2-the flash time travel scene\n3-steppenwolf vs the Amazons\n4-darkside vs everyone\n5-cyborg see the nightmare vision\nThank you Snyder !#restorethesnyderverse.", "Awesome out standing!": "Far better than previous one and better editing for graphics", "Peak Superhero Cinema No One Ever Saw": "Watched Zack Snyder's Justice League with Ben Affleck(Argo) as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Gal Gadot(Wonder Woman) as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg, Ezra Miller(Fantastic Beasts: Where To Find Them) as Barry Allen/The Flash, Henry Cavill(Man Of Steel) as Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman, Oscar Nominee Amy Adams (Arrival) as Lois Lane, Diane Lane(Trumbo) as Martha Kent, Jeremy Irons(The Lion King, Die Hard With A Vengeance) as Alfred Pennyworth, Connie Nielson(Gladiator) as Queen Hippolyta, Zheng Kai (Ex-Files ) as Dr. Ryan Choi, Featuring Joe Morton(Terminator 2:Judgement Day ) as Dr. Silas Stone, Peter Guinness (Sleepy Hollow) as DeSaad, Ciaran Hinds(Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 ) as Steppenwolf and Ray Porter(Justified) as Uxas/ Darkseid.Its 2 Hours Longer but the character motivations should be better flesh and Steppenwolf is scarier and a threat also Freakin Darkseid makes an appearance has an action scene, as well as a presence, love the introduction of Jack Kirby's Fourth World in the DCEU I felt the film was similar to Injustice as well the Darkseid Episodes from Superman: TAS, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited I Fanboyied too me its The Greatest Superhero Movie No One Say better than Infinity War and Endgame and those were solid also yeah really enjoyed The better cut of Also love How of Steppenwolf and Darkseid is Akin to Vader and The Emperor as well Kylo Ren And Snoke even Calls Him Master yeah The Entire Snyder Cut is Peak Superhero Cinema sorry Infinity War /Endgame.Great Score By Tom Holkenborg(Alita: Battle Angel) , Cinematography by Fabian Wagner(Game Of Thrones) , and Direction By Zack Snyder(Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice) Peak Superhero Cinema No One Ever Saw 10/10.", "Great movie": "This film is so much better than the theatrical release. Sad we're not going to see the vision fulfilled. WB made a mistake by exerting so much control over a film.", "This is what overrated looks like": "You can enjoy a movie and still critique it. If you're a specifically a snyder fan you might dig this. But for dc fans, superhero fans, or just casual movie fans\nHeres some of the main issue's.-The music is very noticeable in the worst way. From jarring, unfit song choices, to wonderwomans choir music that shows up everytime shes on screen in battle. It becomes laughable.-The slowmo feels like it makes up half the movie. It works sometimes but it goes wayyy over the top.-The drawn-out overindulgence in scenes. The shots are often beautiful but go on for just so noticeably long. It, again, becomes almost laughable because it sticks out so much.-The flash. Now this was a problem in the original as well but the flashes speed is not felt at all. Ezra is great but the running is weird and just looks funny and tacky.-Although better than in the original cut, the main villian, Steppenwolf, is still bland and basic. And the overarching villian, Darkseid, is just as boring from the little bit we see of him.-The movie as a whole feels disjointed and very scrapped together. It feels too long because it should've been multiple movies but they put all of it in this one, so they're constantly jumping to different lands, worlds, timelines, and if you aren't an avid fan of DC and snyder films, you could quickly get lost or bored.-The story. I've seen others compare it to Avengers and Lord of the rings in terms of it's story and i can see that. It does nothing new, which is fine but if you aren't going to have an original story, you better have a damn good retelling of one. Justice league does not. It's just a lesser version of things you've already seen.-The epilogue coulda been scrapped all together and seems to serve as fan service and nothing more. There are scenes throughout the movie like this but the epilogue is the biggest example. It adds nothing of value. And the joker scene is possibly the worst in the film. Leto proves, once more, he does not work in the roll.Overall, I'm very happy snyder got to see his vision release, and it's definitely better than the theatrical cut. And I'm glad his fans got the farewell movie they wanted. That being said, as a dc fan and a movie fan, I'm also very happy we're moving away from these films and in this new direction of dark, r-rated dc films like Joker and Birds of Prey, The Batman and James gunns new Suicide Squad.", "Epic, awesome, and Zack Snyders vision delivers the dc universe.": "5 out of 5 stars.Zack Snyders Justice League is delivered and it does not hold back for one wild ride. I loved all dc movies. And Joss Whedon Justice League for what it was worth. It did have humor that felt forced. And so many story cuts that felt rushed with very little to no development. Zack Snyders version fixes everything that was wrong with Whedons version. Which Whedon probably could not deliver the vision Snyder had along. Zack Snyders version is different in every way while having some basic concepts from the other movie. Bad guy shows up wanting the three boxes. While Bruce is trying to put a team together.The plot is epic and great. It is a four hour long superhero movie. That makes it bold and epic for a DC movie. Just like how Peter Jackson delivers a fantasy series of Lord of the Rings epic. Zack Snyders film delivers more characters development. More backstory. And opening up for a further dc universe for future sequels.The cast ensemble is big and all did great with there roles. Ray Fisher having more to do with his character Cyborg and a little backstory to his accident. Ezra Miller has more screen time. And introduction to him meeting Iris West. Steppenwolf has more story about his agenda of collecting the boxes to take over the world. With another villain sitting on the sidelines for a futher sequel. They all did great. I am sad that Ben Afflecks Batman future films may not come to be with his recasting.The action sequences are big and huge. Feels like there is more brutal and gritty action that was never shown. Zack Snyder is great at delivering the action sequences. Steppenwolfs appearance and fighting against the amazonians was brutal and intense. The climatic sequences is epic and way better than the other movie.The visual effects are awesome. Every scene backdrop was well done. The characters and costumes are great. Steppenwolfs new look is better by a long shot. Even Henry Cavills cheesy cgi face was no longer shown on this film which ruined the other movie.The humor in the movie was natural and did not feel forced like the other movie. The script did a great job in handling the story and the characters balance with everyone having a spotlight and more to do. The music score by Junkie Xl was awesome. Huge improvement over Danny Elfmans score which made it feel like it was a movie releases in the 80s/90s. Junkie. L score improved with the action and characters themes. Especially Wonder Womans new theme.The climax does have a lot of differences with different results. Without giving away spoilers. It does leave the movie ending with a eerie and somewhat a dark ending with where it can go for sequels. Which would be great if Zack Snyder comes back to do Justice League sequels.Overall, Zack Snyders Justice League is an epic superhero film that is one of the best in the Dc universe. And it was well worth the wait.", "film equivalent of bohemian rhapsody": "And his best film since Watchmen. Proves once again (see my review of Once Upon a Time in America) that Hollywood has a cookie-cutter mindset.", "Much Better": "Vast improvement over the original garbage. Had this been released in 2017, we'd have already enjoyed a sequel.", "very Zack Snyder": "Following Batman v Superman, Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) are searching for more heroes for the upcoming battle against Steppenwolf. They recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and The Flash (Ezra Miller).Is this better? On a basic level, yes. It's not chopped up and corrupted by a different chef. It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder.", "Absolute masterpiece following Man Of Steel and BvS": "It is more than fans wanted from SnyderCut, it is visually pleasing and amazing cinematography along with a spectacular fresh score by Tom Holkenborg, 4 hours pass by so fast making us want more of SnyderVerse Taste.", "Definitely better, but not great": "This version indeed is better, no unnecessary Russian family storyline, no cheap jokes but right amount humor, no kpop music and better score, marvelous colors and amazing fight scenes, more story about characters and Martian Manhunter!!But I think 2017 version still make a good choose by cutting a few scenes shorter, like Batman find Aquaman part, janitor find Parademon part, Wonder Woman fighting terrorists part, or Hippolyta shoot arrow part.And I think in the end Wonder Woman cut Steppenwolf's head off just unnecessary, maybe still let Aquaman use trident on Steppenwolf but then let Superman beat him through the boom tube, after all, situation here is not like in Man of Steel, they have a choose here.", "Truly Epic": "This is the real thing. A phenomenal masterpiece dc movie justice league synder cut I loved this .", "Doesn't meet the hype": "I was looking forward to this movie but encountered mixed feelings. First, what is with the aspect ratio. This alone detracted so much from the movie. Some of the added footage added nothing and actually dragged out a few scenes. Other footage gave a much different dynamic than the theatrical cut. Overall it was an improvement, but the aspect ratio still really killed it.", "First version I gave a 1 out of 10, this is a 7 instead!": "For starters, when it comes to DC vs Marvel, I don't choose one. I love them both. But DC admittedly has had some issues. The first cut/version of Justice League was painfully awful. It was to short, to confusing and rushed tried cramming everything into a small window which made it suck.This? I honestly wasn't expecting this new cut to be way better, I thought maybe it would just be \"a bit\" better. I was wrong. This cut was amazing. You got a lot more action, a lot more build up and a lot more story that made it overall make more sense. Including some rewritten things.I won't post any spoilers, but I will say some of the new hero's are given \"origins\" more or less and more story instead of just being thrown on screen and expecting you to know who they are (for those who aren't into comics). They also mad it more adulted rated. There is blood, a bit of gore (not horrific mind you) and swearing. So it makes me feel even more gritty and real.Now, the reason I only gave it a 7 is for starters the movie is still \"dark\". As in literally it's still a bit hard to see at times. I get its the artistic style of DC, but it's kind of annoying. I had to turn up my brightness more.The biggest complaint is some scenes, especially in the first two hours, go a bit to long. Scenes that don't really add anything really. Alot of talking or singing over drawn out scenes. But if you hang in there, the last two hours get way better.One little nitpick, and not a big deal, there are scenes with modern music and it just feels.... awkward. As does the, at times, endless choir music that seems to repeat. It's meant to give the scenes an epic feel, but again, it goes on and on sometimes.I don't know if I'd watch this again, but I would for sure tell everyone to check it out. Even more so if you didn't like the original version (like I did). I hope DC lets Zack (or whoever else) make the movies more like this, it would really help DC out.", "RESTORE THE SNYDER VERSE": "Incredible, far better than previous cut.The story of \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman vs. Superman\" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and it's perfect. Character buildup, plot, humor, climax, emotions in the movie is so great. It's a sight for sore eyes.", "A few fatal flaws mess up a great experience.": "This would easily be a solid 8 except for a few things.1 This is the worst representation of Batman ever put on any screen. Ever.2 The movie really doesn't need to be so long. Unless you're the biggest fanboy you're gonna notice. Too much slow motion and everything that can be drawn out is.3 The ending. No spoilers. But the trailer made me expect some specific things. I was gravely disappointed.Wonder Woman is amazing at the start. Cyborg is solid. Superman is creepy. The Aquaman dude is a fun cartoon, like Thor played by the Rock. Flash is cool, he does run funny, but that doesn't ruin it for me.", "Blows Justice League away!": "I rather enjoyed Justice Legue and whilst I felt a little meh after watching at the cinema and felt something was missing, Zack Synder has corrected all the parts that was missing from the original. You now get to see a bit about each characters story and it is a lot more involved. It no longer feels rushed (4 hours long it shouldn't lol) and every scene felt like a new film. If you liked the original, you will love this and I literally watch Justice League and then Watched the Synder cut straight after and so glad I did. 4:3 aspect ratio is my only gripe but 20 mins in, I no longer noticed, as the film had me gripped.Well worth my 10 stars", "Heavy editing needed": "I really like Zack Snyder; I follow him since Night of the Dead, 300 and Watchmen; three masterpieces of escapism and two of them huge hits.\nHowever; he loves to overstay his welcome; the three hours of Watchmen (even when basically is frame by frame the comic book was a little too much).\nI hated Sucker Punch but love Man of Steel and even like it Batman vs Superman even when the movie length particularly in the extended versions was overwhelming.\nThis version of Justice League is basically an unfinished movie with heavy need of editing.\nThere are some differences with the Theatrical / Extended releases two years ago.; but essentially is the same movie filmed in a different way (most of the scenes in the old release were re-created but the story is mostly the same).\nDuring the first two hours (this version is over four hours) there are many poorly made special effects , some very weak acting and some long scenes (mostly filled with full songs) that add nothing to the movie.\nIf you are able to not fall sleep; you will get some backstory on the the bad guy; but nothing too interesting.\nThe next 2 hours actions gets more intense and some defects can be ignored (again some FX were not properly tuned up).\nAside from another bad guy, the long dream sequence (small part was already on the theatrical version ) and the Joker presence; there are no other big differences in term of story.\nThe 4:3 / 144:1 was in my opinion disappointing. I seen IMAX movies were the space is perfectly used/distributed. Not as it was here.In Brief: As a curiosity could be interesting but nothing more", "Zack Snyder's Magnum Opus": "A massive improvement over the heavily truncated, significantly altered & extremely repugnant version we got back in 2017, Zack Snyder's Justice League restores the original vision he had for DC Extended Universe crossover feature and also gives the viewers a glimpse of the grand, ambitious ideas he had in store for this cinematic universe. Crafted with sincerity & exuding passion in every frame, Snyder Cut is an epic extravaganza that aptly fulfils its genre's obligations but also dares to be more than that.Directed by Zack Snyder (Man of Steel & Batman v Superman), the premise is more or less the same yet everything about it is vastly different & superior to Joss Whedon's cringeworthy take, so much that it completely erases the terrible aftertaste that 2017 eyesore left on everyone's palate. There is a richness to the imagery that was absent previously, a distinct focus & smoother flow in how the events unfold & add up, and the characters' arcs also exhibit welcome depth as Snyder attempts to expand & explore the rich mythos & backstories of these characters.The plot is divided into six parts & an epilogue, all narrated at a relaxed yet consistent pace. Even the scenes that have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu about them appear more refreshing in this edition. However, the film also exemplifies the best & worst aspects of Snyder's direction, for his ability to design & deliver breathtaking visuals & spectacular action set pieces is here for all to witness & admire but then also evident is his tendency to get carried away & not knowing when to stop. Additional invigorating quality to the experience is offered by Tom Holkenborg's rousing score. And in this cut, Cyborg & Flash are the real MVPs.Overall, Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best revamps one could ask for, for it turns an unbearable atrocity into one of the most audacious & visually arresting examples of its kind. The script still isn't without its shortcomings and the film is also self-indulgent at times but the end product is nonetheless a huge upgrade and is rewarding for the most part. A fitting farewell to Zack Snyder's stint with DCEU despite him teasing where the saga could've headed in the future instalments, Snyder Cut also serves as his thank-you note to all the fans whose unwavering support & relentless movement over the last few years is what willed it into existence.", "Vast Improvement": "\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" (ZSJL) is based on the DC comics Justice League - Aquaman, Batman, Flash, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg (based on the 2011 DC universe)Like many Super Hero stories, the basic plot involves villains and saving the world.Justice League (2017) vs. Zack Snyder's Justice League (ZSJL):\nZack Snyder's version is vastly superior. NO DOUBT AT ALL. The 2017 movie simply could not cover the story effectively in just two hours - the edits ruined it. ZSJL has much better character development, plot and story because Zack Snyder took the time needed to tell the story correctly - not half-a***d.How does Zack Snyder's Justice League compare to Marvel's Avengers:\nMarvel's Avengers Infinity War and Endgame were great super hero movies, but comparing ZSJL to Marvel is like comparing apples and oranges - no point really, enjoy them both. That said, Marvel has a lighter tone, but both movies are packed with action. Snyder is a little dark, edgy, and more serious - Different styles and approaches. I liked both movies and it depends on my mood which one I will watch again at any given time.In conclusion, I really like Zack Snyder's tone and treatment: There is no joking around in Zack Snyder's DC Universe; Zack Snyder takes this s**t serious and I dig that: The source material is viewed with seriousness and respect and it shows.", "GIVE DIRECTORS MORE CREATIVE CONTROL!!! SO much better than the 2017 Justice League!!": "Disney and other studios that have become too uptight and regulatory for their own good need to sit down, watch, appreciate this for what it is, and take notes for the future. This should remind us of the old times when studios wouldn't get in the way of real artistic filmmakers putting their vision in action, and them being trusted to deliver like Mr. Snyder is known to be fully capable of doing! I watched this movie on a long car ride and it was totally awesome, and I didn't even watch the original one (until much later out of curiosity which I ultimately regretted) because shortly after this I definitely felt like I didn't need to! The sound and voice acting of the CGI characters were great, the characters and character development were great, the action kicked butt, and everything color graded dark worked!! While I am typically an avid MCU fan, I am a superhero movie fan first and I have to acknowledge it for what it's worth!", "Avengers you just got served!! WOW now I see his vision, PHENOMENAL!!! NEXT!!": "I get the story and vision now, so glad they released this work of art, story is phenomenal, and WOW.. Visually STUNNING!! I pray to the comic gods release this on 3d bluray or 4k ultra it deserves it!! This shows how Hollywood butchers great art and how they take the artists brush away from the artist. This was night and day I have nothing to say but please give us the next chapter AND LET IT BE SNYDER'S CHAPTER!!!!!! Not j.j. Abrams.", "Better movie": "Snyder Cut isn't flawless but it is far far better than Whedon's version. Lot of things makes sense now because of the additional scenes which gives context. Liked how Flash's & Cyborg's story is expanded. The epilogue episode in the end is totally unnecessary though.", "Wowww Better Than Endgame": "This one is 4 hours , but it never feels boring anywhere. It's really great one, in totally enjoyed it and all fighting seens are just awesome. I'm indian but i like this one.Wonder women bgm is \ud83d\udd25.Great one waiting for part 2.", "Only decent cause the other was so bad": "If this was the original one released would you enjoy it? My answer is nope. Ppl are rating it high to try and prove it was worth making I guess. That being said It's certainly better than it's predecessor but falls extremely short of a good movie. The script is choppy, the music choice at times is mind blowingly awful, and I don't know who approves Snyder's use of slomo but they need to put a limit on how many times he is allowed to use it. This thing would've been ridiculed like BvS if joss' version was never created. The length does allow for Snyder to flesh out some characters, mostly the villains and cyborg. Yet somehow the film diminishes Aquaman and bats as characters. Four hours long and it still doesn't explain why there are goggles on Batman and why he has a random tank haha! Outside of that the only reason it's four hours long is because there is an hour worth of slomo! It's worth checking out if you were one clamoring for this version but don't expect Snyder to break away from all the stuff that made BvS terrible.", "Beats the Whedon travesty six ways from Sunday": "I am so glad that this was done. Also, keep your eye out for a cameo of \"John Jonzz\"... if you are familiar with who that is, that is all I need to say.There were so many things I liked about Man of Steel, and I never was very happy that they rehashed all of that General Zod cack from Superman II.And even that movie has similarities to what happened here, when Richard Donner did not return to direct Superman II. It took us approximately 20 years to get the Donner cut of that, so...Zack Snyder took that story and he wove it into the death of Superman, by turning General Zod into Doomsday.I grew up on Superman comics, I remember when they were $.10. I remember some of the great stories, the Parasite, Brainiac, \"The Composite Superman\" which was one of the most deadly superman/Batman stories.I had the original comic with the death of Jonathan and Martha Kent... and I even had the issue of Superboy, where the Kents were made young, for an alien TV show. The aliens threw rejuvenation-juice into the well on the Kent's property, remember when we had to drill wells into our property to get water? That was life in America, and we forget about one of these basic aspects of survival... we also forget that people had wells on their property.Zack Snyder knew how to homage those great stories of the past by blending a lot of them together here.I must have watched \"Batman v Superman\" A dozen times, the ultimate directors cut, before I started understanding the nature of these \"dreams\".Zack Snyder was weaving the elements of \"zero hour\", which mostly involves the flash, into the story. It is why he has the Flash show up in one of Bruce Wayne's \"dreams\", except that it is not the goofy kid flash that we meet in this film... it is an older, bearded Flash who warns Bruce Wayne that the key to Superman is Lois Lane- but he was \"too soon\". - this was the first time that we were shown that there are alternate timelines that are part of these stories.And even in the ruined Whedon cut of justice league, there is a short vision of Cyborg's that relates to this.I have a lot of the original comics where the death of Superman is told, and I even have some of the comics that talk about Darkseid. Like the infinity wars of Marvel, this is a long complicated story that is told through years of comic books and numerous titles of the DC Multiverse.For many years I have \"made mine Marvel\"- the Marvel cinematic universe has been done in my opinion a lot better than the DCCU, so that now they have elements of the story running through several avengers films, Iron Man, and now WandaVision and falcon and the Winter soldier. But Superman, Batman, wonder woman, Green lantern, HawkMan, and now John Jonzz, these were my original superheroes, and are being referred to in this great cut of this film. And it is about time that the DC cinematic universe has been put back on track by the man who single-handedly created it, Zack Snyder.I appreciate Joss Whedon's work with the Avengers, he did a good job kick starting that franchise. But just as he is a marvel director, Zack Snyder is the DC director, and he never should have been replaced.When I saw the ending of Batman V superman, there is a representation of Steppenwolf that looks very menacing... at the time we did not know who or what that was.But the person that we were shown in the WhedonTravesty was not that same figure. It did not scare me at all. THIS Version of Steppenwolf, scared the bejesus outta me.I could not even watch this entire film in one sitting with its four hour length, I had to break it up over the course of two evenings.It's not just the story that is improved, even though the film itself is longer, the parts that we have already seen, were edited for brevity and removal of some WhedoNonsense, where he tries to add humor into the story and it just does not work. Snyder gets directly to the point, but it is just his style that he likes to let the tale tell itself, regardless of how long it takes.Well I suspect there will be a lot of polarization over this film just like there was over Batman V Superman, but as far as myself, this is exactly how I suspected the film would be, so I was not surprised.I highly enjoyed the ending of this film totally redesigned, it makes a lot more sense like this. Even the scenes depicting Luthers escape, The focus is not on Luther creating his own league of evil, it is merely a business transaction, which is more like what Luther was in the comic books- he was a businessman. sometimes, he was even an ally of Superman's.Do yourself a favor and give this film a chance, watch Batman V Superman, and then throw this in. But do not try to watch it all at once, this is a tale best absorbed in small sections.", "Feels like a piece of work": "An amazing film, even with its horrendous runtime of 4 hours, that has a great build-up of characters that are more explanatory throughout and much better visuals with great editing and a de-saturated look. The action is immersive and much better than the construction of the original film with greater surprises, a beautiful soundtrack and scenes that leave you crying and scenes that leave your mind blown. Zack Snyder proves to the world that his dark universe is one to stay.", "Pretty Average": "As a cinematic film this movie is ridiculous - over 4 hrs long and in 4:3 aspect ratio. The only way I could get through it was to watch it like a 1990's TV mini-series, split it up and accept the corniness. Half the cast doesn't feel right and a lot of the graphics look fairly cheap. Wonder Woman and Aqua Man are so badly casted lol. L think DC really need to step up their level of quality. Seriously, all those close ups of Wonder Woman in slow-mo just look so dumb, why didn't they get someone who can actually act? That said, I will always have a place for these films but this just didn't do it for me.", "A different, but still poorly directed and written film": "The film is better than the \"original\" in pretty much every way, but only so much to bump the rating from the absolute \"1\" to the current \"5\".\nA lot of pointless slow-motion scenes that serve no other purpose than to force some emotions and a forced dialogue that propagates the story without any reason to. If you are a fan of comic books and superheroes, then this film will probably please you. For the non-comics out there, this movie is a waste of time.", "SUPERIOR IN EVERY ASPECT COMPARING TO THE ORIGINAL.": "Comparing to the original, this version is superior in every single aspect. It shows that when you give the director control to show their work great things can happen. The 4 hour run time was a little self indulgent and probably wouldn't have worked in theaters, still the overall story acting, vision, everything was so much better.", "More of the same....much much more": "Better than the 2017 version, but not by a mile. Major pieces are the same, lots of filler and a pace that will send you to sleep in the first 2 hours. Not a fan of how it is constructed, feels very disjointed in places.Goes from a 3 to a 5. Are the people putting 10 seriously saying this is the best film they have ever seen?Glad the fans got to see the original vision though.", "[8.6] Zack Snyder - The DC Director!": "A terrific DC movie with superb screenplay, smooth acting with chemistry, glorious battles and awesome visual effects. There are some seemingly illogical sub-plots in it that hopefully, would be clarified in a possible enlightening sequel.Batman: Powerful, Smart and Resourceful. In a real battle though, with real, serious villains, he would be nearly crushed. Still trying to forget Superman's laser beams onto his forearms. Nothing really destructive happened?! Also, I would like to see his Batship / Batmobile not to get (constantly) torn apart! (Damage-Critical!)Superman: The Best and most Awe-inducing of the league. He single handedly is an invincible army.Wonder Woman: Wonderful, Beautiful and Powerful. Much better than in her solo movies!Cyborg: Powerful, but prone to bugs and destruction.

The Flash doesn't make one joke about brunch. There's no contrived racially-awkward moment between him and Cyborg. Instead, both of them are developed as characters. The camera spends less time trying to look up Wonder Woman's skirt and staring at her posterior. Not as much time is spent on how boring is Superman's rediscovered love of life. The main villains aren't as boring, either. The bugs aren't a hive attracted to fear. No dull family to rescue. Any one of these alterations alone would be a significant betterment. Oh, it's still not an especially good superhero flick, but one can only polish so much such originally misconceived and thereafter worsened franchise excrement. It's still a long and longer--four hours, for crying out loud--exercise in overly indulgent fan servicing and the so-called vision of the artist.A lot of the extra runtime is spent on exposition and fully explaining its McGuffin and totally, assuredly not Infinity Stones of the Mother Boxes. It helps to make sense of the story, but it doesn't make it interesting. The same could be said for the Ultimate Edition of \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" (2016). In that sense of such pacing, this would've been more appropriate as a series--padded in unnecessary repetition and operational aesthetics as those tend to be. On the other hand, the boxes here are explored more for their rearranging of matter, which is a kind of neat metaphor for what was done with the material of this movie existing in a multiverse of two different versions, as well as, perhaps, the continued hypothetical picture that Snyder might've originally finished for the 2017 theatrical cut. The boxes still play into the vaginal Frankenstein narrative of rebirth, electrically resurrecting Cyborg and grave-robbed Superman (and it's still apparent, to me at least, that Flash is the sperm racing through the vaginal spaces of the Kryptonian ship to fertilize the box of an egg, I guess, as it graces the giant homunculus that is Superman's preserved corpse). But, they communicate within the narrative in ways beyond that, including as a signal to bring the Justice League and the baddies together to fight (the whole point of these movies) and showing them visions of alternate possibilities (what passes here for character dilemmas and development). The 4:3 aspect ratio, which reportedly has something to do with IMAX--not that it matters for a movie streamed on HBO Max--is also apt in that it shapes the picture like the square-shaped Mother Boxes. It also alludes to the most common means by which people used to at least see movies outside of a theatre: on their non-widescreen TVs.Beyond that, there's nothing here that strikes me upon first viewing as especially interesting. The CGI, color grading, fights and score are different. Cyborg and The Flash having expanded roles makes sense if they're ever going to have solo movies of their own. There's no real point otherwise to Barry Allen receiving a bit of a love interest as he rescues a damsel-in-distress from slow-mo flying hot dogs, as cool as the sequence may look. The added stuff for Victor Stone, including the development of his relationship with his father and seeing him play some football as expected from the trailers for the last version, works better, and more than the rest of the League, he's at the center of Zack Snyder's cut. Appropriate, too, given that he's the character that is most closely linked to the Mother Boxes and has access to the internet that reaches into all the computerized boxes we have and carry around, to use, for instance, to stream this very movie.The diminished parts for Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill make sense, too, if they're to be dropped from the DCEU. The introduction of Wonder Woman here thwarting a terrorist attack seems to have never made much sense, having nothing to do with the rest of the plot. Hints of a romantic relationship between Bruce and Diana also seem less here, which is fine, although we mostly get them exchanging exposition-heavy dialogue instead. I think Aquaman probably gets the short shrift this time around, but at least he's not serving as extended comic relief in this version. No stupid gag here involving his confession under the power of the Lasso of Truth. Albeit, unfortunately, he is rather a wet blanket--and I can't choose between whether to make that into a water or booze-based pun.What I mostly enjoyed about the overly-maligned \"Man of Steel\" (2013) and \"Batman v Superman\" was how their comic-book characters reflected the real world, Clark Kent a migrant worker, as well as messiah figure, and Bruce Wayne a tough-on-crime plutocrat and cosplay enthusiast. The destruction of Metropolis was one big 9/11 allegory, and the sequel's fight over Kryptonite another corporate battle over finite resources and immigration paranoia. Both \"Justice Leagues,\" however, are pure fantasy. Sure, I'll take Snyder's gloom over Whedon's jokey MCU rip-off, but neither aesthetic is compelling in itself. \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) didn't just work because it was dark, nor \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014) simply because it was light. What we get here are boxes--largely full of franchise building and superfluous superheroes and supervillains on top of the already extant continuation of Jesse Eisenberg's obnoxious Lex Luthor, for sequels that are likely to never happen. In the end, I suppose that's the nature of the box, though: full of manifold potential manifestations, but with only some to ever be realized.", "This is the film we should have gotten back in 2017": "Determined to ensure Superman's ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne aligns forces with Diana Prince with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.All I can this film from start to finish. Sure I will it is really long and you would need to find 4 whole hours in a day to watch the whole thing (altogether on Blu-Ray the film is divided into two parts so there is that luxury), however I will say it's all worth it in the end.After this film I definitely realised how much the original Joss Wheadon version was completely butchered Zack Snyder vision film. But i am not going to talk about that here. If you want to see my thoughts on the 2017 please just read my other reviews.The pacing of the film was very good. I am glad the film has many different acts/segments so that the viewer isn't just sitting there for 4 whole straight getting board. Giving the view more of a smoother experience.The CGI was a massive improvement, then what was there originally. I do particularly like how Steppenwolf, Darksied and Desaad looked.The fight scenes were really fun ride to watch especially the last fight with Steppenwolf.The music was also excellent.The acting ignoring the two bad apples in the room was excellent.If you want to experience the real version of the DCEU Justice League, this is the film not the 2017 film.", "you fanboys are crazy...": "Is it bad? I don't think so. is it that much better than the other version? absolutely not. is it way too longer than it has to be for no good reason? you can bet your ass it is.", "This is a real Superhero Team Up Movie": "Once again Zack Snyder has made another masterpiece when his original and true vision for his Justice League movie was released earlier this year to critical acclaim. The Snyderverse must be restored and Warner Bros must give full creative control over to Zack Snyder because he truly understands the DC universe like no other, it must happen. Every single event from Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman has been building towards this epic masterpieceWith Superman now dead and with both Darkseid and Steppenwolf have been inadvertently notifed about his death thanks to Lex Luthor's communication with Darkseid's uncle, Steppenwolf now sets out on invading Earth to gather the three mother boxes, forming and synchronizing them to help Darkseid conquer Earth but also personally for Steppenwolf to be redeemed in his nephew's eyes after his inital betrayal. Steppenwolf is a complex and well developed villain just like Zod and Lex before him. You could literally feel in every scene Steppenwolf has with Desaad that not only is he determined to be redeemed, wanting to come home and get back in Darkseid's good graces, I think you can still feel his resentment for Darkseid since Darkseid is Steppenwolf's nephew, eternal boss and more powerful than he is so Steppenwolf has no choice but to serve his masterIt's also really awesome to see that despite how powerful Steppenwolf is by easily over powering the Justice League before the final battle with Superman's return or taking down many Amazons and Atlanteans to obtain the first two mother boxes, he becomes so submissive and perhaps afraid shedding most of his armour when Darkseid first makes contact with his uncle over the revelation that Steppenwolf has found the Anti Life Equation. It just goes to show the audience that if Steppenwolf is scared of his nephew despite being a force to be reckoned with, he is nothing compared to Darkseid when and if we will ever see him invade Earth for a second time in a future movieBatman, having his faith in humanity in restored as well as still feeling guilt ridden over Superman's death and wanting to redeem himself, sets on a request alongside Wonder Woman to recruit Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash to form The Justice League. At first things don't go to plan with recruiting Aquaman but it wouldn't take too long for him to come around and join the team. And yet despite their mission to save the world from Steppenwolf and Darkseid's inevitable return, the Justice League has problems of their own with Cyborg being bitter over that he is now a cyborg and views himself as a freak with a strained relationship with father. Flash is sort of an awkward but loveable and hilarious loner trying to get a a degree in criminal justice to help prove his father's innocence and Aquaman having mommy issues and turning his back on his own peopleHowever, despite these obstacles and managing to overcome their demons for the good of humanity and as well realizing they need to resurrect Superman to truly stop Steppenwolf, they manage to form a strong bond with one another. Almost like a family unit as each one overcomes their demons, no longer feeling alone and accepting each other. Seeing Superman come back from the dead in this version was truly special with a badass scene of fighting the Justice League as he didn't remember who he was until he saw Lois Lane. Plus the scene where Superman returned to his ship reminiscing over everything both Jor El and Johnathan Kent has said to him throughout his journey in life and it's from there Superman realizes who he is, what he is meant to do and has a second chance to realize his destinyThe final battle itself was just incredible with all members of the Justice League uniting as one to successfully takedown Steppenwolf, his army of Parademons and preventing both the mother boxes from synchronizing, and Darkseid from conquering Earth just as he tried to do centuries ago with Darkseid himself observing the final battle through a boom tube shortly before it closed and death of his uncle. Enraged but also determined knowing that his ' great prize' the Anti Life is on Earth vows to obtain it, destroy the Justice League and conquer the entire MultiverseWhat makes this movie even more special is despite the Justice League succeeding in the end or even that one brief moment where Steppenwolf had succeeded in synchronizing the mother boxes is that through Cyborg's visions of the future along with more glimpses into the Knightmare scenes, nothing was being done to prevent Darkseid from winning. It feels like it's inevitable Darkseid will obtain the Anti Life, conquer Earth and the Multiverse, turn Superman against the Justice League and destroy themI hope someday Zack Snyder is able to make Justice League 2 and 3 to see where his story and how the Justice was going to stop Darkseid was going to go. That and along with that scene of Lex Luthor hiring Deathstroke to kill Batman after revealing Batman's identity to Deathstroke. This needs to happen. The Snyderverse is the true version of the DCEU and it needs to be completedThis movie is so damn good, especially when you watch it after seeing Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman first. It really didn't bother me that it was 4 hours, it could have been 10 hours and I would have been fine with it because those 4 hours of watching this amazing masterpiece just flyby every single time. Phenomenal story, gripping action, epic CGI and superb acting.", "better than orignal": "I had huge expectation like everyone else, his cut of watchmen didn't disappoint , this is very good film but not as good as watchmen snyder cut", "The Justice League movie we deserved in the first place.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is about the origins of the teaming up of Batman/Bruce Wayne(Ben Affleck), Superman/Clark Kent(Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman/Diana Prince(Gal Gadot), Cyborg/Victor Stone(Ray Fisher), Aquaman/Arthur Curry(Jason Momoa) & The Flash/Barry Allen(Ezra Miller). Inspired by Superman's selfless sacrifice, Batman teams up with Wonder Woman to recruit more superheroes. This is to prevent an otherworldly threat, capable of destroying the world.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a mind-blowing movie. It's a real shame that we didn't get to see this version of Justice League in theatres back when it first released in 2017. What we got instead was a film with cringe-worthy scenes & dialogues, not to mention Superman's terrible looking CGI moustache removal. Director Zack Snyder has finally been given the chance to complete his vision for Justice League. Snyder gives all the titular heroes, plenty of moments to shine & doesn't make a mockery of them, like Joss Whedon's theatrical cut did. This movie doesn't disappoint. In fact, it surpassed my already sky high expectations. The action set pieces are phenomenal. The climactic set piece is unforgettable & is the highlight of the film. Ben Affleck is superb as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Affleck's Batman is just as badass, as he was portrayed in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). Henry Cavill is terrific as Superman/Clark Kent. Cavill nails his performance as Superman, yet again & I'm so glad I can now forget about the disastrous CGI used on his face in the theatrical cut. Amy Adams is perfect as Lois Lane. Gal Gadot is awesome as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince. Ray Fisher is the star of the show as Cyborg/Victor Stone. Jason Momoa is amazing as Aquaman/Arthur Curry. Ezra Miller is spectacular as The Flash/Barry Allen. The supporting cast is awe-inspiring. WB, please let Zack Snyder continue directing Justice League movies. A must watch & the best movie of the DCEU!", "Redemption...": "I never thought this could possibly turn out as good as it did.I was exceptionally disappointed by BvS:DoJ so when I did happen to see Joss Whedon's Justice League I was glad to some degree that the film was at least watchable. However, upon hearing about The Snyder Cut, I was still nevertheless intrigued. I re-watched BvS:DoJ and appreciated it slightly more so I went out and got the Ultimate Edition and was pretty much blown away. It was through the BvS ultimate edition that I decided that I should perhaps give Zack Snyder a chance again.I am very glad I did!Without doubt, Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the BESST SUPERHERO FILMS EVER MADE. I would even go so far as to say that I would consider one of my all-time favourite films ever in general.It completely puts the Joss Whedon version to shame and I feel utterly disgusted with myself to think that I once considered that version of the film 'okay'.Every character is more fleshed out and you feel genuinely invested in each and every one of them. The story is relatively simple but the narrative and how each character has a role to play is so gloriously complex and yet gel together so well that it's flawless. It does not feel like a 4-hour film and yet uses the vast majority of that time so well to create a film that takes it's time to form something glorious and at time heartfelt.Unlike the Whedon version and most other superhero films in general there are stakes and lives on the line which you really don't know if they'll be saved. There is genuine tension and surprise in the film.Favourite part - undoubtedly The Flash being 'the best of the best'. It's a scene that would have been outstanding on the big screen.However, the film's last 20 minutes are completely unnecessary, as is the character of Martian Manhunter. Get rid of them.Other than that, believe me, Zack Snyder's Justice League is up there as one of the finest comic book films ever made. If you have only ever seen Marvel films, or the now accursed Whedon version, please see this film and witness how a superhero film should be done.", "The all in one package": "A must watch for dc fans , definitely it is worth watching the 4 hours of watchtime . A visual treat , especially the slow motion visuals are awesome. This version is improvised a lot from the 2017 one . The character development is done way better than the previous version. Definitely worth your time", "Finally": "We have been waited for 3 years.\nWhat a great show from the dairctor Zack Snyder\nThe visual effict is very amazing.", "Quick non spoiler review": "This four hour version of Justice League might have an hour of footage from the two hour version from 2017 abut even most of that footage is given very different context by the 3 unseen hours. The film looks a lot better and more consistent visually and has a much clearer and often over explained storyline. The first two hours is filled with narration, exposition and montages (often in slow motion). The next two hours is where the team finally forms and are much better paced. The fact that this was released for streaming means Snyder got to show absolutely everything he filmed and it does feel a little long and I think a theatrical cut of Snyder's vision around the three hour mark could be better. That said this is far better than the mashup we got in 2017 that cut the heart out of the film and so much storyline based around Cyborg and the Flash to a lesser degree.\n6/10", "Better, but still disappointing.": "This was really frustrating. One the one hand, it's a massive improvement over the theatrical cut. On the other hand, that's not saying much. I've seen some people say that it's a completely different movie, but after watching it, I have to disagree. The Snyder Cut is still basically the same movie.There's a lot to like. The added scenes make some of the events that happen make more sense, the effects are a little better, most of the bad jokes are gone, Cyborg gets a lot more to do, and yes, it is a million times better than the other cut.However, a lot of the things that I disliked in the original are still here. Apart from Cyborg, most of the characters are still pretty bland, Steppenwolf is still very uninteresting, the action is still forgettable and I'm just not emotionally engaged enough.There's a lot added to the movie, but a lot of it seems like it's only there to set up movies that may never even happen.Also, there's a choir singing that plays whenever Wonder Woman shows up and I hated it.In the end, I'm really glad that Zack Snyder got to finally make the movie he wanted. I believe all filmmakers should be able to make their movies the way they want to make them. But this movie is still just Justice League but longer. It's an improvement, but being better than Justice League (2017) isn't a huge accomplishmet. Disappointing.", "Far from Super": "PLOT: Superheroes unite to stop the bad guys.IN BRIEF: Mind-numbing muddle of the superhero variety.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) In 2017, writer/ director Zach Snyder parted ways over his movie, Justice League, mainly due to some personal reasons and artistic conflicts with the studio. That film was then given to up-and-coming director Joss Whedon to salvage and make into a cohesive whole. He failed and the movie bombed with audiences. Now, four years later, it has been resurrected by the original director who made his \"new\" movie 4 hours long, adding some new footage to fill out the gaps of the characters' motives and their backstories.I missed that earlier version, as superhero movies are generally not that high on my list. So I cannot compare the \"before and after\" effect. I can only attest to the fact that this reviewer was underwhelmed with the whole enterprise of the director's cut and I have to admit that I had bouts of confusion about some plotting details. (So please take my bias into account while reading this review.)However, many critics have gushed that Mr. Snyder's version of Justice League is an epic sci-fi fantasy. Some even equate this version with the re-imagining of Coppola's Godfather three-part saga. Really? Now that was a masterpiece. This can only approach that level of excellence in some sort of time warp scenario. How about a reality check, people? Justice League (2020) may be a fanboy's wet dream, but I found it loud, crass, and mind-numbing. No matter how you reassemble the 2017 footage, the central story is just a series of battles over three magical boxes that evil forces want to get into their grips in order to conquer the universe. Ho-hum.To stop them, Batman assembles a mighty crew of do-gooders. A younger Ben Affleck, who looked beefier than usual, has little screen machismo or depth as the Caped Crusader. When asked about his superpower, he smugly states, \" I'm rich.\" An honest assessment, but hardly inspiring for a superhero's mantra. As our \"dead\" Man of Steel, Henry Cavill looks like a buff shirtless model in nicely tailored hip-hugging black pants (not that I'm complaining) rather than the Superman of yore. He is more the Superman of Yawn. Other members of the guild make their presence known in varying degrees: Jason Momoa is a boring washed-out Aquaman but as the conflicted superhero, Ray Fisher as Victor Stone aka Cyborg, has some fine moments. However, the perfectly cast Gal Godot steals the film with her natural Wonder Woman appeal and Ezra Miller brings much awkward charm as the Flash for that young teenage crowd that makes his character all the more endearing. Together they fight to save the world, although they can't save this movie due to three central factors:1. The CGI is uneven, going from schlocky to merely good. (Loved the winged Parademons though.) The head villain, Steppenwolf, voiced by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, looks like a stylized Gillette razor with horns. He's big and quite the bully, but the necessary menacing aura is sorely missing. Even worse in the visual department his his boss, Darkseid, a mass of inky black globs that show very little expression.2. The staging of the non-stop action sequences remains extremely blurry and difficult to make out with the pop-art explosions, jumpy camerawork, and bodies being flung to and fro. Mr. Snyder's trademark technique of speeding up the action and abruptly slowing down distilled moment of combat is still there, but that jarring gimmick doesn't do much to awe his audience. However, with probably one hour of non-stop slo-mo photography filmed for this venture, you can easily understand the increased viewing time.3. Padding the minimal story did little to explain the chaos on screen or in the script by Chris Terrio. Of course, much of the dialog is hard to distinguish anyway due to the over-amplified voice manipulation. It's also difficult to tell just who won the vocal contest between a gravelly mumbling Mr. Affleck or computer-generated Mr. Hinds. Both try to speak in the lowest decibel range to insure their manhood...no sopranos here!It may have been a noble idea on Mr. Snyder's behalf to finally take control of his earlier movie for a sense of closure. But Justice League 2020 will never end anyway. As the movie's epilogue hints, it's on a continue loop. Onto the next chapter, studio honchos! Fanboys are waiting! (GRADE: C)", "Style Over Substance": "Is it better than the 2017's one? Kinda...Yeah, there is much more storytelling, but the main idea and the final outcome is the exact same. I mean you can polish old car howmany times you want, but is still the same old car, right? Same here with the whole \"Snyderverse\". DC are already ahead of his vision and this movie does nothing except to please the Snyder crowd.Snyder is very good with the visuals and this is a known fact. The problem is, that you can't make motion pictures for 4 straight hours and telling people, that this is great idea. Maybe, if you're 14 and still loving the 2010's CGI, slow motion all the way and action over the actual story.The effects are questionable, yeah they're better than 2017's, but this ain't some big achievement in my book. The villains looks like plain CGI puppets, there is nothing that resonate with me and no, I'll not compare Darkseid with someone from his rank, but you can do the math.There're some plot holes, that ruin the whole DCEU continuity once again and this is just because Snyder thinks only about his 3 movies, not the grand scale of this universe. Some characters look complete different just because...he like them this way?I still can't believe somehow you think adding characters like The Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Darkseid and more for first time it's good for the bigger picture. There is no actual gradation, there is no empathy.Still, there are some great shots, particularly with Batman and Superman. I said earlier that Snyder is a \"painter\", that's why my review is named \"Style Over Substance\". The nightmare sequence was the most interesting thing for me in this movie, added to the story we already know it feels like a whole other movie which is not a complete lie if you think about it. Snyder's plan was to make sequel where he explores this story and Darkseid eventually becomes the big baddie.The music score is better (I appreciate great epic tracks). In some places it's overdramatic, but overall it's fine.I'm glad that finally his vision is out, no matter that I think he changed a lot of things, knowing there will be no JL 2 soon. I just really hope this whole drama to end now.Is it a good movie? Yeah, if you compare it to the bad cosplay show from 2017, but knowing that the story is basically the same, with more pompous scenes and still some bad CGI effects, I would say no.Great visuals if you press the pause button constantly, not a great movie.", "Faith, Alfred. Faith!": "Zack Snyder proves again why he's light years ahead of all the moviemakers working today, and this time we can do a toe-to-toe comparison with a guy who has already delivered a couple of billion dollar films. This is a guy who has recovered from an emotional wreck and delivered us a masterpiece for the ages. This movie is a 4-hour long visual and emotional roller coaster that doesn't let your attention waiver even for a minute. I've waited until my 5th rewatch to review this movie just to make sure that I don't fall prey to the hype that has surrounded it and yet I only love this movie a little more on every rewatch. Every minute, every scene has a purpose. The music blends beautifully with the scenarios. The characters are meaningful and well acted; even the cameos seem to have a sense of importance here. There will always be people who will unjustifiably criticise Zack Snyder and his Justice League, but I will say again that he is the greatest movie maker of our generation.", "self indulgent and over done": "This film come across as a piece of self indulgence. For the guy who directed Sucker Punch and The 300 it is a serious let down compared to most of his other work.Also when compared to the theatrical release, there are scenes that really are irrelevant to story and seem to have been included purely on the basis that they were filmed.This is one is purely for the fans", "Good movie, yet its not fair to compare it to original": "Greetings from Lithuania.\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" (2021) was a way better movie then a previous version. That said i think it is not fair to compare these two movies because on their core they are very different products. 2017's versions run time was 2 hours. This new version is 4 hours. 2017's version wasn't a terrible movie, it was just a very mediocre one. And if you extend the original one by 2 hours, and have a significant budget to change many of the things, its way easier to do a better movie. Zack Snyder's version is existing because it was only a streaming movie - it would have never been greenlighted as a theatrical movie.Overall, \"Zack Snyder's\" is a good movie despite its running time 4 hours. The first hour was a bit of a mess, but later i really enjoyed it.

I never thought I would be asking for a sequel to the Justice League but after watching Zack Snyder's original vision in all it's glory, I have to say... we absolutely need to see Snyder's Justice League 2. The movie is absolutely stunning to look at and the action scenes as well as the overall design and framing is greatly improved. There is far more context given (obviously) but I honestly felt myself naturally moving from scene to scene, enjoying every aspect just that little bit more because of the set up this film gives you. The performances are all strong, the music is godlike at times. The aspect ratio at first feels strange but very quickly becomes not only bearable but actually admirable. Everything feels earned, every time Steppenwolf took another Mother box a little chill went down my spine and the spacing out between them is perfect. I'm glad each character had time to have their own little stories too, it gave me a far greater emotional connection to the stakes of the movie. Darkside isn't in the movie much but time practically stops when he is and it's awesome. The ending of the film sets up a hell of a lot and I absolutely must see what Snyder was going to do with a sequel. The pieces In play are just too good not to capitalise on. Overall, a pretty brilliant film. I barely felt the time, neither did my brothers who watched it with me. We all loved it. A strong 8 to a light 9/10.", "The Beauty of a Film Without Executive Meddling": "It's no secret that the DCCU hasn't had the best of luck, and they really did everyone wrong with the original including and especially Zack Snyder and most of the cast. Zack Snyder might not be the best director, and not all his movies work, but I will always have infinitely more respect for him as a director and a person than I ever will for Joss Whedon especially now, Whedon's style has bored me for years and the original movie was the final nail in the coffin. But I've never seen a director's cut be exponentially better than the original quite like this. Everything that was wrong with the original is completely fixed here, the character development, especially for Cyborg, is honestly probably the best I've seen in a superhero movie, period, the action scenes are incredible even against such a high bar, and it just does a fantastic balancing comedy, action, and just pure emotional weight, arguably even better to me personally than even Avengers: Endgame. I can name double-digit scenes that actually had me crying for real, and that's not something too easy to do. I don't even care that it's 4 hours, it could be 10 for all I care because this is how you make a damn movie. It wasn't without it's problems, but I didn't really care all that much. The Epilogue was pretty much the perfect way to end the series as a whole, like it was just incredible. It sucks that DC is still kind of mistreating the crew even now when they're clearly their best asset, but this movie is just near perfection. I think it deserves even better than it's usually getting.", "Way better than the 2017 version...": "Pros:\n1. Fixes almost all the problems with the previous movie.2.

Yes it's really hard to watch it in one go for 4 hrs (I did it in 2 parts) and the 4:3 format that was supposed to be ideal for IMAX bothered me on my TV but I respect Snyder's vision and wish to release it this way. The story now makes sense and the whole movie manages to keep you engaged. I still think special effects are still lacking like in most DC movies (I mean at times it's like watching Matrix 2... why can't they get to MCU levels?) and some of the dialogue feels like it was written by a 13 year old but overall that's one of the best DC to date for me.", "Beautiful": "Such a beautiful movie full of emotions and a very unique arc by the director.

This movie is long because it has to be, when you introduce 6 super heroes you can't get away with a 2 hour movie like the theatrical release which felt rushed and confined. The plot has to develop and marinate into something as big as the story, with proper character arcs and tone setting for an epic journey was crucial. It gets a perfect score from me because there is a perfect sequence-of-events and ranks among the most re-watchable stand-alone movies I've ever seen.", "A lost vision brought into the light.": "Well, well, the fans have spoken. After the controversial \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v Superman\", both directed by Zack Snyder, Warner Bros sought course correction. During the filming of \"Justice League\", Snyder suffered a family tragedy and left the project (also, WB apparently planned to axe him anyway). Joss Whedon was brought in for reshoots, resulting in a crossover that not only bombed financially, but was just average, which, for freaking JL, is embarrassing. For years, fans demanded to see the original version, whose status bordered on legend. 4 years later, WB delivered via HBO Max. While I wasn't super hyped, it garnered my attention. Did it live up to the hype?In general, Snyder's JL is better. Characters are fleshed out more, especially Cyborg who not only expresses more emotion but goes through a solid arc about accepting his change and forgiving his father. In fact, he's basically the main character given the amount of focus he gets. Flash's jokes are less cringy and he's generally more useful to the team while Aquaman is given greater depth and emotional attachment to the League. Batman is more effective in combat with a few new tactics/gadgets to give him a needed edge and his reasoning for bringing together the team is given further justification. Wonder Woman doesn't do much new, but is still well-acted, kicks plenty of alien butt, and being the team's voice of reason. Lois' grief over Superman's death is expanded on, which leads to a bigger emotional payoff later on that's given time to truly breathe. Not only does the villain Steppenwolf look much better with a monstrous design and shifting armor, but he's given substantial pathos, motivated by redemption rather than blind conquest. For what little screen time he has, Darkseid is suitably menacing with a cool voice to boot. The function of the Mother Boxes is explained further, being sentient supercomputers with powers beyond reckoning and at times challenging the heroes rather than being simply plot devices. Action scenes are longer, allowing characters to go further with their skills/abilities, though this time there's blood and stakes that feel impactful. The music is also slightly more memorable, the standout being the Amazon theme which has a lady choir singing (which does get overused).This version isn't without faults. The big overarching issue is that it tends to be self-indulgent. Snyder's love of slow-motion is excessive; scenes like the Flash going fast are called for, but other times like Hippolyta simply running it's unwarranted. It makes the first half especially very tedious to get through. The 4-hour runtime is pushing too far as there are moments and even entire scenes that could've been cut out or cut down such as the post-apocalyptic epilogue (Joker is annoyingly out of focus most of the time), WW fighting British terrorists, and creepy Icelandic women singing to honor Aquaman. The muted color filter makes it look almost black-and-white sometimes; works for Batman, whom Snyder clearly loves, but not as much for the other heroes. Elements like Aquaman's origin conflict with what's established in films diverging from Snyder's vision. A few plot holes/gaps in logic aren't fixed like an aspect of Flash's power, Steppenwolf's teleportation, and Darkseid somehow forgetting both the film's MacGuffins and the supposed one planet he lost to. The dark/evil Superman gimmick is so overplayed these days I'm sick of it and how it's used here still makes little sense. Another hero is introduced, which, while well-designed and casted, is pointless to the story. Oddly, there are parts the theatrical version does better like certain dialogue exchanges and Lois' arrival to stop a rampaging Superman. The Snyder Cut also does a lot of sequel baiting, leaving plenty of elements unexplored/unexplained, which, given how much the DCEU is struggling to get a foothold as of now, are unlikely to be paid off.All in all, Snyder's JL is an interesting experience, especially when compared to the theatrical version. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but if you were to ask me which is ultimately better, then that would be the Snyder Cut.", "No words...": "Best superhero movie ever.\nThank you Zack Snyder.\nCan't wait for Justice League 2I cant believe what did i just saw....\n10/10 is the minimum i can give for this amazing vision.", "We got what we wanted!": "The movie is 4 hours which is really long and I don't like long movies but I had no problem with this one. It didn't feel like 4 hours and I think that's really good. The story was much better because they had much more time to tell the story and it really paid off. I also loved that it was more violent, it felt more realistic. The characters are great, the acting is great, the music is amazing, just the movie overall is really really great.I'm so glad that we as fans have made this possible because I wouldn't have wanted to miss this movie! Definitely worth my 4 hours and I'm sure I'll be rewatching it soon!", "It's a fantastic movie": "No words to describe. It's awesome. One of the best superhero I would say", "Good...Just Good": "I mean it is obvious that this version is far better than the 2017 cut by our friend JossAnyways I feel like the story is strechetd by slow mo and some dialogue (some times necessary, sometimes dont) but it is essencially the same movieThe 3rd Act feels far superior and the only point in the movie where we see a substancial change, anyhow, the 3 hours before tht part could have been just 1:30 or 2.Completely innecesary epilogue, not one but the 3 of them, just a los of loose ends in 10 minutes to hype some fanboys.", "Poor generic superhero movie.": "So underwhelming. Firstly, I have never seen the 2017 version of Justice League, but this film was beyond disappointing.I have to say that the whole film is somehow entertaining and never becomes boring because through the whole film I expected it to lead to something cool, but sadly it didn't. The film is extremely stretched out, there are so many useless scenes. In the first 2h40min, almost nothing important happens... Most movies would've shown the same things in 30min or 1h max, but here it's 2h40min, just unbelievably overlong. And later on, it does not get much better either, it's still overlong. They could've easily cut 2 hours from the entire film and it would've been the same (pun intended).Flash is so annoying. Just like Spiderman from MCU, the DCU version is Flash. He's so irritating and immature, such a dork.Aquaman is pretty much useless to the film. They could've removed him and nothing would have changed.The villain is so bland and lame. Most generic evil thing ever.Ben Affleck is truly terrible as Batman. He talks all these motivational monologues, but he looks so fed up of all this, his face looks tired the entire time and he clearly is just bored in the entire film as if the Batman has been an alcoholic for his entire life (pun intended).The film has extreme CGI overuse. I think there are more CGI in this film than non CGI and most of the CGI is not good.Action for the most part is not good. It's very bland and forgettable. There is only one action scene that is good, but at least it is indeed good, no, not just good, it's awesome. It's the fight in the Superman memorial monument park when Justice League fights \"something\". But that's the only good action scene in the entire film, everything else sucks.I guess the music is great, though it is reused the same music from previous films.Overall, this film was so disappointing and poor, that it made me appreciate Batman v Superman a bit more.The Avengers (2012) did a very similar premise, but much better.", "Absolutely wonderful.": "What a difference watching the Snyder cut from the Wheedon cinema release. It's like a different story and so much more thoughtfully aligned to to the DC backstory (and more faithful). His slow burn cinematography and brilliant soundtrack (remember Watchmen, 300?) make this another treat of a film fest. It's 4 hours, but I've watched it a couple of times and I can't think of a scene that could be cut out. Thank you Mr Snyder.", "JL": "The movie is a masterpiece, this movie made Justice for this heroes, best DCEU movie, almost cried, just watch the movie, you won't regret it", "Zack Snyder's best work yet": "The movie that hardcore dedicated Zack fans fought for has finally been released. I'm not a huge Zack fan and I honestly didn't like Batman v Superman (BvS), although I did like Man of Steel, I also supported the movie because I believe the movie released should've been Zack's true vision. I watched Justice League (2017) in theatres when it came out and thought it was a very bland movie that had very obvious reshoots from another director in it. If I had to give that movie a rating then I would give it a 1.5/5. The premise is still the same \"Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's (Henry Cavill) selfless act, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) enlists newfound ally Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) to face an even greater threat. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly awakened enemy. Despite the formation of an unprecedented league of heroes-Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) -- it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions\". So does this live up to the hype or is it overrated?Let's get this out of the way first, this version is infinitely better than the 2017 version. The best scenes in the 2017 version were all Snyder from watching this version. I did wonder how different this version was going to be from 2017 one but it feels completely different. I would say 70% of the 2017 version is in this movie but the editing, removal of Whedon scenes and addition of new scenes changes this into one with tonal consistency and coherent storytelling. Since this version is longer, it also feels like there are more build-up and tension throughout. Due to this every scene that was also in the 2017 one now feel a lot better and earned. The screenplay is still written by Chris Terrio but unlike BvS it feels a lot more engaging and not unironically silly. Some powerful and emotional lines here resonated with me which is quite surprising.Additionally, the action scenes are more enjoyable in this one due to its R rating and how it's longer now. The biggest change is to the action in the climax where instead of in 2017 where Superman does everything, the team all contribute so it feels like everyone was relevant to the team. Junkie XL returns to score this version from BvS and it is amazing. His score adds a lot of impacts compared to Danny Elfman's 2017 version. It's a lot more memorable and makes scenes feel more exhilarating. There is also an Aquaman and Flash theme of the sort that sounds great albeit not as iconic sounding as say the Wonder Woman, Lex Luthor or Superman theme from BvS. The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is pretty good for the most part and there are still those gorgeous shots that we expect from Snyder. The humour from the 2017 version is now toned down substantially so no more \"wHaT iS BRunCh? or Flash landing on Wonder Woman boobs, thank god. Surprisingly, there is still a fair amount of humour here compared to BvS which some say was lacking in a lot of fun. The humour in this version land a lot better and is the right amount as well which add some levity to a mostly serious natured story.The biggest improvement this version has is the characterization. Cyborg has a proper fleshed out arc in this version. You have a greater understanding of his dislike for his dad and his feelings about his current situation but still having a believable development where he grows to accept who he is now. He is the heart and soul of this movie in thanks to Ray Fisher's wonderful performance. They turned a character I barely cared about even before the 2017 version, into one of the most interesting and memorable characters. His relationship with his dad played by Joe Morton is some of the best aspects of the Justice League. They also conveyed his power very well and made it seem incredibly powerful. Flash is also improved a lot as he now has more to do. Despite still being the comic relief of the team, he is no longer unbearably annoying or treated as trash compared to Superman and is now actually doing super cool things that make him way more interesting. Ezra Miller is quite lovable in those comedic moments which are genuinely funny but when the serious moments come, he delivers a great performance.Aquaman has some slight improvements as well. More scenes are explaining his reluctance to become King of Atlantis and also some more scenes showing his stone-cold outwards personality but hidden kindness compared to the others. I also love his interactions with the Flash including a small scene where Flash is asking Aquaman which looks better which is just a nice interaction. He also does a bit more aqua looking powers in the neat climax. Wonder Woman has more action scenes that make her more badass which is nice. Her animosity and rivalry against Steppenwolf is a lot clearer as well. She also has some nice interactions with nearly every member of the league including Superman and Alfred. Batman has a naturally continuing story from BvS where he is the one who is trying to assemble the team. His interaction with Alfred are some of the best with Alfred questioning him not doing things with a reason but from guilt instead. Unfortunately, his action scenes don't live up to that of BvS and he doesn't change at all from beginning to end. Superman appears near the end, so there isn't much to his character arc or story since it was just beginning. He wears a black suit in this version but it doesn't have much significance in terms of story or reason behind it apart from it looks cool I guess? Batman and Superman the most iconic characters are the weakest characters in the story surprisingly. Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) has clearer motives this time around as he now wants to collect these Motherboxes to get back into his master, Darkseid, good graces again. His new design makes him look for alien and his action scenes make him more fearsome. He is a better villain compared to the 2017 version but is still just someone for the league to fight rather than an interesting villain.However, some characters don't improve in this version including Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who in every scene is just mourning Superman. She is described as a key character but doesn't do anything else apart from hogging screen time. Commissioner Gordon (JK Simmons) has fewer scenes in this version compared to 2017 and both just involve him talking. Makes me wonder why JK Simmons bulked up for the role just for talking scenes.The 4-hour length of this movie is honestly fine since it is releasing on streaming and since fans have been fighting for ages, they might as well see everything that Zack shot. However, in terms of the story, the movie could still convey important aspects without having to be 4 hours. There are a lot of scenes that drag on for too long or pointless scenes that don't add much which could easily be cut. The pacing of the first half is incredibly slow as well and it takes a fair amount of time for things to start picking up. There are also some scenes with slo-mo and some vocal song in the background that are kind of cringy and go on for way too long as well. The team don't even assemble until over 2 hours. The ending also goes on for too long which is weird as there is a very satisfying ending but then it keeps going. This new additional shot ending from Zack is cool but it feels slapped on. There are also some scenes concerning a certain character that occurs over halfway through the movie but is just really distracting from the main plot. They then appear at the ending but it feels kind of unnecessary for the story. I don't particularly mind the 4:3/square ratio that this movie has but it does take a while to get used to and I still find 16:9 would look better on my TV. Finally, some of the CGI looks bad and unpolished which is slightly distracting because they are very noticeable.Overall, I was incredibly surprised at how much I enjoyed this version of the movie. I'm not a big fan of Zack Snyder but this might be his best work so far. I am glad he got to release his vision of Justice League and hope that this isn't a complete one-off thing. This was a great win for fans and was worth the long, gruelling fight.", "Justice League Snyder Cut": "Review By Kamal KThis film is everything that a DC fan ever dreamed of . Visually stunning and narratively satisfying from start to finish, it is not just best DCEU film of all time but also one of the best superhero film of all time. While the 4-hour runtime may at first seem daunting to take on, the film actually moves along in a way that feels more like a 2 1/2-hour movie. This is a beautiful testament to Snyder using every bit of that time to masterfully build the story & character arcs in a way that feels entirely earned.A few spoiler-free thoughts/standouts:1. The Action: Phenomenal action! It's nothing short of thrilling, to say the least. The action all throughout this film was a huge standout & all perfectly shot by Zack Snyder.2: Wonder Woman: In my opinion, this movie was hands down the BEST portrayal of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman so far. She's strong, feminine, inspiring, and downright the warrior we know & want her to be. She fits into this film so well & Gadot's performance is top notch.3. Cinematography: The cinematography & visuals could not be better! This is an absolutely GORGEOUS film with exceptional CGI. Snyder did a phenomenal job of making every single shot in this movie look incredible.4: The Score: Wow! Tom Holkenborg took on a TREMENDOUS task of composing nearly 4 hours of music for this movie & it absolutely does not go unnoticed. I would even go as far to say that the music in this IS a character that supplements the story and visuals perfectly. It is such a beautiful score.Overall, it was worth the wait and surpassed expectations.", "A momentous story that exceeded every expectation": "A four hour long epic superhero movie that defied all expectations, Zack Snyder's justice league is a rare pop culture occasion that exemplifies the phrase dude, you just had to be there. It's impossible to review this movie without comparing it to its 2017 antecedent, the Joss Whedon helmed Justice League. Zack Snyder's vision for the film deserves to be judged on its own merits and faults and, for that reason, I'll try my best to keep the comparisons to as few as possible. There's little need to delve into the back story and drama surrounding this entire project; if you know, you know and if you don't, not knowing won't change your impressions of the film.The story of Zack Snyder's Justice League picks up just before the ending of Snyder's 2015 superhero movie Batman v Superman. As Superman is speared through the heart thanks to one of Doomsday's bones, the cry of anguish he lets out reverberates across the world, serving to introduce us to a few of our various characters. The amount of time that lapses after that opening montage is unclear; it seems that it could be days (the idolatry statue of Superman smashed by Doomsday remains in rubble) or it could be weeks (as evidenced by certain items in Lois Lane's nightstand). Regardless, Superman's death toppled a number of dominoes that lead to the awakening of the Motherboxes, the shiny Maguffins of the DC universe. With the awakening of the Motherboxes comes Steppenwolf, hype man for our big bad Darkseid, who is attempting to locate the Motherboxes and fuse them together so Darkseid can cleanse the world and claim it as his own.As far as supervillain plots go, that's about as standard as it comes. With the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicking into a new gear around 2012, audiences have come to demand more complex, layered, and nuanced antagonists; Darkseid's attempt to take over the world is a thin, one note ordeal, as flat and uninteresting as a James Bond villain. The swerve comes with Steppenwolf, low on the chain of Darkseid henchmen but the primary antagonist of the film. After committing an unspoken folly, Steppenwolf's desire to prove himself worthy to his master is his driving force of the film, making for a more layered performance than originally received. Sympathetic? Absolutely not but still more understandable and relatable; who amongst us hasn't wanted to prove their worth?The first 75-90 minutes of the film are a bit disjointed, hopping between multiple plots of Bruce Wayne attempting to assemble the team, establishing Aquaman and Flash, cramming in a Cyborg origin story, and occasionally cutting to a moping Lois Lane. This setting of the board and introducing characters sacrifices the pacing of the movie. If any serious editing needed to happen, the first two parts of this six part film required the most judicious editing. Once we settle into the third part, when the story really starts advancing, is when things get interesting.The story beats of Zack Snyder's Justice League remain the same: Wonder Woman foils a terrorist plot, Batman visits Aquaman and Flash, the assembled team fights Steppenwolf under Gotham Harbor, they resurrect Superman, we get that big battle, and then they go on to defeat Steppenwolf in a third act climax. It's the quiet parts in between that are different; a four hour run time allows for better character development. As action oriented as Zack Snyder is known for, some of the quieter moments remain some of the better ones. Victor stone and his interactions with his father are more fleshed out, the reason for Victor's animosity and bitterness further explored. Audiences get a better introduction to Barry Allen as he saves Iris West, presumably setting up for his solo movie. Diana retrieving the arrow sent by the Amazons is given more weight, and even Bruce and Alfred's relationship is mined more deeply.The performances by the ensemble cast remains strong: Gal Godot as Diana Prince is still warm and radiant, Affleck is one of the best actors to portray the Batman to date, Ezra Miller plays the comedic aspect of the team with skill, and Cavill, while not in the movie much, still remains the best Superman to date. The delight comes with Ray Fisher, who has the best comeuppance as far as comparisons between the two films. While the extended runtime still needs editing, the fact that Whedon chose to edit out most of Fisher's work is criminal. He lights up the screen with a heavy bitterness that still doesn't drown out his natural charm. Whedon did provide Fisher with what I think is the best line of the 2017 release (if these are gifts, why am i the one paying for them?) and it's unfortunate we don't get it in this version. Still, of any actor that has a drastic change from the Whedon release to this one, its Ray Fisher's Cyborg. Conversely, Lois Lane is neutered in this release, relegated to mostly bit parts of sulking at home over Clark's death and rejoicing over his eventual resurrection. Whedon's version gave her a bit more agency, being the anchor that serves to ground Clark at a crucial moment. She's still that anchor here, but the circumstances have taken away that urgency and a bit of her agency.As far as directing, this is some of Zack Snyder's best work yet. Apart from Watchmen, which I still think is his pinnacle, he brings a different sort of flavor to Justice League not found in Man of Steel or Batman v Superman. All the Snyder classics are there: extreme slow motion followed by speed ramping, frantic action, and Snyder's constant striving for an epic tone are all present here. Again, the quieter moments are where he seems to have grown as a filmmaker; bombastic fight scenes are only as good as the underlying development of the characters in between. Artistic flourishes like the dirge sung by the Icelandic women as Aquaman leaves and the interaction between Ma Kent and Lois Lane provide more weight and gravitas for the characters, a compliment to screenwriter Chris Terrio. But Snyder doesn't get Superman! Is an argument often heard with which I disagree. I think Snyder has updated the story of Superman for a more modern audience, eschewing the Chris Reeves era paragon of hope and decided instead to show a more realistic lens of an alien god living on our planet and the struggles he endures. Unfortunately, one of the glaring tragedies of ZSJL is the fact that we have a Justice League that is mostly absent of a Superman, its central figure. With such an egregious run time, the lack of Superman feels awkward and the cast incomplete. Even with his return he's mostly absent or separate of the group until the third act battle which means we as an audience get precious little time with a fully formed League.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous; Zack Snyder and cinematographer Fabian Wagner have an incredible eye for shot composition and lighting. Snyder uses his feel of great visuals to his full command here, helping to lend to that epic tone. Are the slow motion shots excessive? Absolutely. There's little reason something as simple as Lois Lane walking out of a coffee shop and opening her umbrella needs to be shown in slow option. Nothing is gained by it and nothing would be lost if it was presented in normal speed.The most egregious downfall of the entire film lies squarely in the absolutely absurd epilogue. What serves as the film's coda are two big scenes, one featuring the return of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and Joe Manganiello's Deathstroke and the other a rehash of the \"Nightmare Batman\" scene, plucked from the middle of the 2017 release and recontextualized. The Luthor/Deathstroke scene sets up a glimmer of a continuation of Snyder's story with Luthor beginning to set up the Legion of Doom, now an idea unlikely to come to fruition (but I also thought this movie would never be released so what do I know?). The issues lie in the Nightmare sequence, that sees a radically different group of heroes working together to bring down evil Superman. The crux of the scene lies between Batman and Jared Leto's Joker, a complete nonsense of a conversation that only serves to drag down the goodwill of the previous scene. Written by Snyder himself, the dialogue is cringeworthy and Leto's acting incredibly subpar for an Academy Award winning actor. To follow that scene with Bruce's first meeting of J'onn J'onzz, which is also lackluster, derails all good feelings that the audience could've had as the end credits roll.Ultimately, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a film mostly for those who are fans of Snyder's previous works and have been anxiously awaiting his original vision since the drastic 2017 Whedon release. At four hours, it certainly suffers from a lack of editing, which gives credence to the thought that the movie overindulges in Snyder's whimsies; the excessive slow motion and speed ramping, the extended battle scenes, all the things that make Zack Snyder are the things that somehow both amplify and hurt the film. It's weird. Still, this is the first and likely last four hour superhero movie we are ever apt to get. Snyder's approach to making epic films with flawed characters who are atoning for past transgressions and attempting to find their identity in a world of madness makes for beautiful cinema that's still hampered by inconsistent pacing and a CGI filled third act. Regardless, the accomplishments of Justice League, combined with the remarkable story behind its release makes for a film that, when seen in full, is a momentous story that exceeded every expectation. On its own, it's a fine film filled with eye popping visuals, rousing action, and great character moments. As compared to its 2017 brethren, it's leaps and bounds superior, indulging in both the bombastic and the quiet moments. Zack Snyder's Justice League is currently on HBO max.", "DC finally got it together...": "This is the film that DC fans have been waiting for, and this revitalised and restored version of Justice League does not disappoint at all!Having watched it, there can be no other decision by Warner Brothers but to restore Zack Synders DC universe and the timeline he has mapped out.The pacing of the film is great, taking time to introduce each member of the justice league and provide ample backstory on the threat that faces earth. The film doesn't feel rushed and there aren't big set pieces for the sake of it, the dialogue is cleaner, and the interactions between the characters feels far more genuine and less forced than in the previous released version.The main point though is that the story is just far richer and compelling than the diluted and shortened theatrical release. You buy into the characters and the story, rather than it just feeling like an overtop action movie.It's the best DC have produced within the DCEU, and if they stick with it, it bodes very well for the future of the franchise!", "Batman tries to assemble a team of heroes as he believes an enemy from other world is coming.Can the newly formed team defeat the odds?": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a far superior director's cut which is unique on its own because it differs from the original one due to numerous factors. For me it can be a described as an artistic masterpiece which was worth all the 3 years wait. Story is the backbone of this one and gives it the intensity it deserves. The opening itself gave me goosebumps and made my eyes watery because the way it is connected to BVS is mind blowing. From there on the film is a fantastic journey with more than enough moments to cherish. Action sequences are one of the biggest things to watch out for this one especially the History lesson and Steppenwolf V Amazons, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Superman was lit. Coming to characters, all the characters got their own deserved better character arcs. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are total badass whereas Flash, a comic relief and Cyborg are still on their path of discovery of their full potential. Superman had a short time in the movie still he serves his purpose of providing the goosebumps Superman fans deserve. Batman feels like sidelined and might be reserved for the next part. Steppenwolf is a whole different villain who is terror at times but his arc rightfully explain his actions. Cameos of Joker and Darkseid was lit as hell. Coming to actor performances Ezra Miller and Ciaran Hinds stood out among all. The film tone,BGM,frames,versatile aspect ratio and landscapes are other factors to watch out for. Mind blowing twist and the epilogue is another factor to watch this epic.Coming to cons, Minor CGI issues due to budget constraints can be spotted here and there. Lack of importance for Batman was a major disappointment for me. The movie is truly artistic at times and some scenes felt a bit laggy. Last but not the least the movie contains some similar scenes from 2017 version which can't be called a con still it felt like watching the same thing.On the whole Zack Snyder's Justice League is everything you ever wanted from a DC film. Enjoy!Rating:83%", "One of the best and most important superhero movies ever": "Truly a monumental film, that not only shows the amazing outcome of letting a director show their true vision but also how true fans can move mountains.", "One of the best.": "I can't believe how much better this version is compared to the theatrical release. This is not only the best DC movie ever but one of the best movies ever.", "Really Great Comic Book Movie!": "This is the first time watching any version of \"Justice League\" and I gotta say I really enjoyed it! I loved the six part plus epilogue format as it felt more like reading a series of comic books. Everything was solid in this movie. From the special effects, to the story, the action, it was all what I'd expect out of a pretty darn good comic book. I felt like every member of the Justice League team was explored to a good enough degree, although I felt Aquaman was the least interesting of the characters, and Flash was a pure joy! That scene with the resume, hot dog, and car accident was as memorable as you get! I really liked the story of the cyborg too... with the whole father plot going on. Excellent! Superman was pretty interesting to see when he just regains consciousness and is a bit confused about what's going on and operating on pure instinct. I felt that was executed quite well, though the \"cure\" was a tad predictable. Yes, this movie had many predictable moments but really is that such a bad thing? Sometimes a story can be classic and that's fine. We don't always need twists here and there.Anyways, now I'm curious to watch the original Justice League to see if it's really all that bad. I honestly can't see how it could be good with so much cut out of it! I even gotta say, the ending of the movie had me wanting more.Could DC be onto something here? I mean, I kind of love the serious, darker-than-Marvel old fashioned tone here. Not too too dark but just right... not corny... the right balance for these types of characters and storylines... Just feels right for DC. In a time when Marvel has sort of lost its shine, and played itself out, I'd really love to see the DC universe take form! I want more Batman (played by Ben Affleck), I want more Superman (played by Henry Cavill) and all the others. I want them back for sure! Gimme more!My only main criticism? I wish this were widescreen, seriously. It's jarring to watch in \"full screen\" mode and sure I get it... this is just how it was filmed and meant to be imax blah blah blah but seriously... wish they thought of this beforehand. I think it would look better in widescreen. Nobody can argue this movie benefits from two black bars on the sides.A second watch I might upgrade it to 9/10. As a comic book lover, having watched these childhood heroes and villains treated so very respectfully... I gotta say: yes! A great comic book movie. It did what it needed to do!And then here comes my other slight criticism to the franchise as a whole. I wish we could have gotten just one or two movies of Superman being a good guy. He was a bit too emo in the first Superman film... and never really had a chance to just save people. Like, you have to know who Superman is or have read the comics to really understand him, and this DC series sort of just assumes you know him and add this on top. If this were the only movie series containing Superman, he would not really be the Superman we know and love. That said, I'm intrigued by what might be coming next with the evil dream Superman. So I'm still in. I just wish we had a couple more Superman-being-good-and-saving-the-cat type of movies if you know what I mean.Anyways, let's see where things go. I have a feeling that the success and reception of this movie might lead to more goodness!", "One INCREDIBLY Well-Done Film!": "I just had the pleasure of spending 4+ hours watching this Magnum Opus, Zack Snyder's Justice League.I kept checking the timeline and hoping that I had hours left in the film because it ENCOMPASSED So much of this story about Darkseid and his plans to conquer the earth.Its spans different timelines and goes into the joining of the Justice League by Barry Allen \"The Flash\" and VictorY Jones \"The Cyborg\" and their very personable back-stories.

I had seen 300, and Watchmen by that point, and was a HUGE fan of both (later I would find out that he also directed Dawn of the Dead). I couldn't wait to see Man of Steel on the big screen. After I saw it and loved it, I couldn't wait to see BvS Dawn of Justice. There was a lot of backlash over the theatrical release of that one though. The theatrical cut was in NO way a bad movie at all,, it was however a little bit choppy and disjointed in certain places. Well,, if they would've just added 5-10 extra mins that the extended version shows that would've cleared a lot things up (imo). The extended version added another half hour onto the already 2.5 hr movie, but imo it was perfect!!! Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition brought 3 iconic superheroes together in the best way!! So,, I obviously couldn't wait at all the see Justice League!! Well,, of course the Snyder family went through a horrible tragedy, and Joss Whedon came on to finish the movie (post production/addt'l shooting/etc). Now,, as a person who is a BIG FAN of Joss Whedon's work (both TV and movies),, this was NOT a good decision. Oil and water, so to speak. The theatrical release of Justice League was in NO WAY bad. Not at all,,, it was just not as good as it could've been. The humor and the darkness didn't mesh completely. It was disjointed. The special effects weren't as good as they should've been (do I need to really explainanything here?). Some dialogue was not what it should've been. It just wasn't as good as it should've been!! Then, fans wanted to see the movie that Zack Snyder had intended for them to see. #snydercutAt long last,, here we are,,, and it's AWESOME!!I will probably never watch the theatrical release again, not after seeing this. Yes, it's long,, but no one said you have to watch it all in 1 sitting!The tone of the movie is right. There is humor, but it fits in with the movie. The DC world is darker, and this movie sticks to that the way BvS did.Everyone's stories are dove into more. Barry, Arthur, and Victor get a good bit more backstory. All of which show us more of who they are and why they are who they are.Also,, Martian Manhunter makes his appearance!! Of course,, he's been there the whole time,, we just didn't realize it (unless you're an uber DC nerd or something).Barry!!!! The Flash is still the comic relief, and boy does Miller bring it!They got Steppenwolf right imo. They also dove into his story a bit, and we got to see how he has come to be who he is, and why he is doing what he does.Also,, we finally get to see a lil more of Leto as Joker, and it is so WORTH IT!!! He didn't deserve all the bad reviews on his turn as the clown prince of crime. Imo, his take was very good, we just didn't get to see enough of it.", "BETTER THAN THE THEATRICAL FILM": "\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is better than Whedon's film in so many ways. The runtime allowed us to get to know the characters more. Cyborg is by far the best part. We finally met him and what he did for that mother made me cry. His interactions with his parents were also heartfelt. As for the rest of the cast, they were almost the same as they were in the theatrical cut but had more characterization. The villain, Steppenwolf, looks better and is a bit more menacing here. The nearly 4 hour runtime, however, was too much and the director, Zack Snyder, could've removed 30-45 minutes.", "Thank you Zack Snyder for reviving Justice League": "Released in 2017, DC Comic produced Justice League was released across the globe to a disappointing reviews from critics and fans who had a sky-rocketing expectations. Director Zack Snyder had to leave the project in between due to his daughter's loss and Joss Whedon (of Avenger's fame) fill into his shoes. Result was disastrous with shabby visual effects, bad editing and over-the-top screenplay. Fans urged the Warner Bros studio to show them the snyder cut justice league and finally the Zack Snyder Justice League was premiered HBO max, Book My Show yday after 3 years. The uncut version is 4 hours long but believe me each and every scene is so well-defined that I couldn't help my self but wrote my thoughts on the sameZack Snyder's Justice League turned out to be more thrilling and exciting than the theaterical version released in 2017. It was definitely a ground- breaking super-hero flick with never seen before CGI.Batman is building a team comprising of Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman as the world is threatened by new enemy, Steppen wolf, who plans an attack on Earth by unraveling three mysterious Mother Boxes. Together, Justice League with new members must fight the evil to save the mankind.It would have been really challenging for Zack Snyder, director of 300, Man Of Steel, Batman vs Superman, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a solid job and turned this comic-story into an enjoyable fun ride. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The introduction of each superhero is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out - return of Superman, Flash getting a surprise of his life when he realizes that Superman is faster than him. Climax fighting is well executed. Screenplay is good along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the star cast.Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline and lovely performances. It is definitely an improvement over a 2017 version of Justice League which deserves to be experienced, applauded and remembered.", "Sooooo much better": "I wish I could unsee the theatrical release of the Justice League. I'm permanently scarred from it. But this version made sense. I could follow it. Yes, it was awfully long. But it paid off. We got a coherent film that actually kept my attention. It was more fun than I expected, and I didn't have to see Henry Cavill's creepy CGI mouth in the end.DC and Warner Bros have a long way to go after the crap they've churned out, but this movie is a step in the right direction.", "The Snyder Cut": "Aah Justice League, how I hoped I'd never have to think about you again. The theatrical cut of this movie is, almost infamously so, a tremendous mess of studio interference, mash-up of directors and the unfortunate destruction of Snyder's personal life all leading to a remarkably bad movie. Now, seemingly since the release and critical flop of Justice League there has been talk of a mysterious Snyder cut that would right all the wrongs and make this mess coherent and I've gotta say, it kinda did.Lets start positive. The extra scenes here add a LOT to the story. Suddenly our mysterious and completely forgettable villain has a purpose and a character aside from just being a big ugly CGI thing with mommy issues. We get hints at the larger picture that all of us nerds knew about but the casual movie goer didn't have the first clue of. The relationships with these characters all feel more fleshed out and developed rather than just haphazardly thrown together because the story demands it. Cyborg even has an arc now beyond just being a poorly CGI'd metal monster slash plot device. The final battle has more stakes too. Basically, all the things that were there and good or had promise in the theatrical get amped up and for the most part, it's in a good way.The inverse though is... This is a 4 hour movie. 4 hours is a ridiculous amount of time to expect people to sit around for a Justice League movie that isn't even really the culmination of anything. If Marvel had decided to release Infinity War/Endgame as one movie we'd have all been upset about that and they spent over a decade building up to it. DC has had significantly less time and less success in building their universe and this 4 hour runtime is just absurd. It FEELS like 4 hours too at times and that's a big big problem. Also, this is a well known re-release and it feels like it at times. I know they got a pretty crazy budget for it but if you're going to spend the kind of money on this that they did and make it a four hour monster the CGI needs to look better than it does. Cyborg still looks wrong and the big bad just looks like a cartoon. That's not even taking into account the other effects that clearly weren't 100% finished for this thing.There's also a precedent here that I think is worth discussion. In the past, we've had multiple version of a film be released. Theatrical, Director's Cut, Final Cut. The original Blade Runner is famous for have multiple versions of it. It's hard to think of a situation where a movie was released, failed and then had a bunch of money dumped into it for it to be rereleased in hopes of turning a profit and public opinion and I don't know that I like this idea of studios making a movie, failing and then trying a second time. I totally appreciate there were other circumstances at play here and I'm not angry about this one, I just worry about when say the next Star Wars comes out and bombs, do they try to remake it? Will they do that to the Last Jedi? It's a slippery slope.Philosophical ideas in movie making aside, the Snyder cut does improve on the original Justice League but I don't think his improvements warrant another four hours of your life. It still feels unfinished somehow and it's just hard to tell someone that they need to go and watch this thing because it's slightly better than the original. For fans of the content and general movie buffs, yeah this is probably something you'll want to watch. For the casual movie watcher though this is a bloated behemoth of unnecessary that doesn't deserve to eat up 1/6th of your day.", "Just watch it!": "This is one of the best superhero movie I've ever seen!This four hours of pure entertainment!Ifyou don't have seen should you watch it right now!If you don't like superhero movies this is stil the movie for you.", "An experience of a lifetime.": "As someone who didn't hate Justice League but only felt it was a little less exciting at times, I was eager to see what Zack Snyder could bring to its director's cut. Running for 4 hours, it is one of the longest superhero films you will ever see, and is personally the longest film I've seen in general to date. Although I did take a break in between, since sitting constantly for 4 hours is not that easy, there was not a single second that bored me or left me exhausted in a bad way. Moreover the state-of-the-art visual effects completely stole the show, and intensified the at-times-gory, outstanding action sequences in a great manner.I was not sure how it was going to be told within the 4-hour runtime without feeling stretched or dragged but that didn't happen here. I was totally into the film's atmosphere and found it an epic experience of a lifetime. The film is undoubtedly a lot better than Justice League, which now feels like a lighter version only. While a lot of scenes from the original film are retained, the amount of originality and fun Snyder brings to the table is commendable. He has handled the usual cast very well, and it reflects sincerely in the performances. One other thing I loved was the revamped design for Steppenwolf that felt a lot deadlier and spectacular as compared to the original film. And honestly, I'd be lying if I say I wasn't mesmerized by the music that accompanied most of the scenes featuring Wonder Woman; that was something next level!By telling the story in different parts, Snyder has allowed it and the characters to develop properly. A lot of backstory is given to certain characters, and it only makes things better in hindsight. Normally, films this long tend to be just slower and dramatic, but while there is indeed a bit of slowness and drama, Snyder has packaged it with so much action that there is technically no point you can think of pausing. Plus, the visuals are so gorgeous this film needs to be owned on a Blu-ray. Be it the glowing battles or just some scenic rainfall in general, the Snyder Cut is totally a visual masterpiece. I would be really surprised if this doesn't get an Oscar nomination for best visual effects next year.Plus, while the epilogue feels a little stretched, it gives you a couple of decent surprises and wraps up the film with a sense of satisfaction. Having spent 4 hours with the film without feeling bored or dissatisfied, I can say the HD rental on BookMyShow Stream was totally worth it. I would easily recommend this to DC fans, and even action lovers in general, although they'd need to have seen the previous films to get a bit of the backstory. I was not expecting to be blown away by a film I had in a way already seen and found decent enough for a single viewing. This version is something I'd like to collect, whether it's a DVD or Blu-ray. And given how spectacular the locales and visual effects were, I wish they release a 3D version as well; I can already imagine how spectacular it'd look!", "It's not over": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) is what we wanted from the beginning! Justice League (2017) is dead in the water, and this is DC's superhero team in the near future. Zack Snyder has done the perfect job by bringing his own vision onto the screen, and it's what every DC fan would wanted.It certainly is a long movie, with a lot of dark theme, and tension. There is so much more to look forward too in every chapter. Some of it might seem repetitive due to it being an original motion picture, but it's not so original there aren't any new additional scenes, and oh boy, are there new things to look forward to see. The DCEU looks to be back on track, and to add to an extra cherry on top of the perfect icing cake, The Martian Manhunter makes an appearance played by Harry Lennix who was originally portraying as General Calvin Swanwick in Man of Steel (2013) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), tell me that's not exciting to see!It heavily focuses on Ray Fisher's Cyborg, and his backstory is told well. His isolation is a true dark tone Zack Snyder was looking for. Cyborg is a much better portrayal in this movie than 2017's version. Ezra Miller's Flash stays as the comic relief we see in the original, and it's what the Flash should be. And, of course, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa's Aquaman, and Jeremy Irons' Alfred, are great to see again, even better than their original versions. The story in itself this time around feels like what a DC movie should be, it's amazing how a movie can change dramatically but stay as original as possible.Zack Snyder deserves a lot of praise for his vision, it does enough justice to keep it as great as they wanted it to be. Very impressive, I'd suggest you stick on Injustice 2 afterwards if you're a DC fan.Bring it on DC! What else you got?8/10.", "Phenomenal epic": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a phenomenal epic that's emotional, thrilling and awe inspiring whilst also being a significant improvement on the other version in almost every way.All the Justice League benefit greatly as every character is a significant improvement on the 2017 version. Ezra Miller's Flash and Ray Fisher's Cyborg benefit the most with more screen time, stronger arcs and more inventive uses of their powers. Ben Affleck's Batman is also a significant improvement and a reminder as to why he's so good in the first place.Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa don't get as much of a significant improvement but are still superb. Ciar\u00e1n Hind's Steppenwolf is also a massive improvement and a much stronger villain. The design is more impressive and detailed whilst looking much more threatening. He's given much more backstory to make him more than a one dimensional villain.The 4 hour run time is not a problem as it is superbly paced and constantly moving. The longer run time also allows the film to fill in a lot of the plot holes, explore more of the DC universe and truly flesh out the characters who haven't gotten a solo film.Zack Snyder's direction is perfect. The film is consistently visually stunning and extremely stylish. The action scenes are thrilling and visceral and his iconic use of slow motion is reliably effective. Tom Holkenborg's music is amazing, extremely epic and dramatic but with a satisfying amount of callbacks to previous DCEU films.However, it's not without its flaws. There is some weak CG (although the majority is excellent), and there's a surprising amount of jokes present from the previous version and not all of them work. The epilogue isn't really that necessary but still satisfying as a fan but these are very minor problems in the grand scheme of things.Overall, Zack Snyder's Justice League is the definitive Justice League film and easily Zack Snyder's best DCEU film. The characters are done justice, the narrative is more coherent and the music is a huge improvement. Whilst it does have some minor flaws, being able to see Zack's vision in all its glory at this level of quality easily outweighs them.", "Snyder Improves On Many Levels, But Excess Still Takes Away From Full Potential": "So much to discuss in such little time with words, but I'll do my best to complete. Snyder's storytelling can be an art when given the right directors, time, and investment and he proves that quite well in this cut of the movie. A story that does not feel disjoined, the writing felt much more like a movie and less like a comic book, that worked to keep the confusion down, the thrills involved, and the story movie unlike some of the other DC installments. This versions use of characters was much more fluid and many of the \"lost\" footage shows origin stories, psychological dives, and relationship building that truly deepens the shades of these rich characters with a lot of convoluted history. Even the once bland main antagonist Steppenwolf is taken to a new level, his story no longer a flat tale of petty pawn squashing bugs, but one with stakes, better depth, and integration into the much bigger picture of this potential universe. So much of the added scenes felt worthy of being included, even to the point that this movie felt completely new despite how much had been recycled from the 2017 version and that is impressive in my book. With Snyder's eye, the time, and this level of storytelling/improvement, I must say the pace was surprisingly good for these movies that often drag like the 2 o clock wall effect on Friday. Snyder managed to keep everything moving to be mostly entertaining, but never rushing through things to minimize explanations or leave a character snuffed for the most part. And as an extra bonus, and one I feel Disney needs to learn from, is dropping the forced and unneeded comedy that the movie did not need and would have distracted from the more intense atmosphere this movie held in each minute.\nIn terms of editing, again major improvements across the board for me given the new aspect ratios they presented in and the editing effects that came into play. While the parademons, future scenes, transformation effects, and contrast all got bump ups, it's really the bad guy designs that were my favorite aspect. Steppenwolf looks much better, not some hybrid computer-reality mess, but a CGI monster worthy of belonging in a comic book movie fighting the justice League. His master, Darkseid accomplishes the goal as well, though not as realistic as what I've seen in other films, DarkSeid still looks incredibly menacing, and promises much chaos should he be used again. Past the designs of the characters, the movie does a much better job of balancing the emotion, really dropping the silly, PG-13 atmosphere that the earlier version did and upping the stakes on many levels. Dramatic character moments feel much more in touch with reality, digging deep into character moments and touching those nodes that should connect you to the moment. For more tense moments, the editing has helped a lot with cutting the diverging story plots and comedy to instead keep you grounded in the dialogue and planning of the high profile scenes to come. And the music in much of the movie is perfect, epic bouts of orchestra ballads that capture the emotions of just about every moment. It helps add character to these scenes, works well with the sound effects, and adds that background effect to get the heart pumping when the gloves, or gauntlets come out. Yet my favorite improvement was the action aspect of the film. In the first rendition, action scenes felt clunky, unorganized, and limited given the PG-13 atmosphere of the film. It led to a few good sequences that lasted seconds, but in the long run felt like the greatest moments clip instead of a conducive piece. Not the case in this film. Snyder takes the spirits of the comics and super imposes them into the film, again removing the interruptions and focusing on the heat of the moment to bring you much more coordinated fights. Character integration in the fights transitions smoother, the inclusion of blood (while darker) removes the limiters and allows for more creative fights, and the edge of it all ups the stakes as they add twists into the film to help make more dynamic moments. Choreography wise it's an improvement and though I would have liked even more (especially during the flashback war), I must say this was 100x better than I expected and something I wish Marvel Movies could capture again. I'll say here that Flash's moves need some work for me, the 2000s cartoon and video games able to do a better job in terms of actually fighting vs. his inclusion in this fight, which re still good but seriously could have used a little more punchy -punchy).Okay that's the goods, but there are still some flaws for me that no love of DC comics, comic books, or feeling justice is served by getting this can make me ignore. For one thing, the sound quality surprisingly sucks at times during this movie. Warner Bros must cut costs on balancing sound, bass, and treble as it feels uneven and fluctuating, primarily during the dialogue moments, kind of important. Perhaps a state of the art sound system will help this out, but this is the third movie they've had this trouble on and I'm not impressed. A minor nitpick for me, but goes in themes is the excess Snyder seems to do at times with his gimmicks, scenes, and content that goes from impressive, to tolerable, to annoying. One of those for me was the Wonder Woman chant that appeared at the perfect moments when the Amazon appeared at the right moments. Yet, the movie soon used that sound for any action see started doing, going from impressive to hilarious as it randomly appeared, cutting a tiny piece of the epic away for me. Again minor, but a lead in to my next parts of the dislikes.\nThe editing of the movie was good on so many levels, but there was times where Snyder's power to extend the movie was taken too far. Though I was happy with most of the comedy being taken out, some of my favorite moments were lost in this new cut. Flash's dialogue had been toned down, the sarcasm of Aquaman lessened, and the famous scene where he lets it out was gone. I missed some of those moments breaking up the darker theme of the film, but this is still on the lesser scale for me. Instead what annoyed me more was the Snyder vision moments that he just loves to fill his movies with. Don't get me wrong, some of these slow motion shots are perfect for magnifying those finishing moves that games and movies are great for portraying. However, other moments were not really needed. Wonder woman flicking back her hair, a random bullet shell falling, and scowling at the camera... these are joke moments that still remain in this film and don't impress me. Even Flash's speed force moments get old, the slow motion running for every part of his movement losing the impressive feat for me outside of a few moments where creativity sparked some diversity (especially that ending whew). But yes, a little more speed fighting and less slow motion running would have improved Flash for me further in this movie. In addition, some of the CGI still needs work. Though improved, there are still some edges that need to be cleaned up, tweaked and integrated to make the realistic effects come out in their full glory. This was no truer than for Cyborg, who when clothed or in certain lighting looked boss, while in other components came off looking like one of those 80s movie robots covered with CGI shading, again how did the cartoons get is so right when they had to do so much more work to make it come to life. Warner Bros may not have the budget Disney has, but I've seen them work some magic and I hope to see it again.\nYet the biggest complaint I'll mirror in my review is the time aspect. Snyder may have done a good job with the pacing, included so many good story components, and improved the action, but it still is a 4 hour movie. This long piece of entertainment is presented in parts, a nod to the head for developing break points for you to come back to if you can't invest in the full length movie. However, this approach also could have opened up an opportunity for something else (more on that later). Though so many of the changes are pluses, there are moments that were not needed for me. Opening shots of Bruce treading across the mountain, a drawn out shouting in the opening as a recap, candid shots of Lois and Mrs. Kent driving or walking around for extended times, and some of the background moments are excessively long and could have used some dieting. It was these components that bloated the run time and could have been either swapped with some more action scenes, those comedic moments I talked about before, or just cut off to drop about 30 minutes or so off of the film. Perhaps the one scene in particular that could have been dropped, was the second \"after credits scene\" that was about 11 minutes long... for an end teaser. Sure, it's a comic book lover's dream, the references, the potential teases for the movie, the cameos and tension all there to whet your appetite. But at the end of the movie and the length... it did not need to be this long of a scene when it may never happen. Petitions may get this universe reestablished, but this epilogue was very pointless for me and could have been left for another day, especially another character (one of my favorites) making the small appearances they did. Perhaps a means to make the CW universe canon, this character's inclusion was a bit shallow for me and could have had a better epilogue moment with a little more planning. This brings me to the final point... this 7 part movie could have been broken up into parts like a series for me, meaning Snyder could have made this into a limited series and potentially taught CW how to make a good DC adaptation. This presentation felt very much like episodes pieces together into one long movie and could have helped the time aspect of this film had they taken this approach.", "Once in a lifetime experience": "Absolutely love this move. It's a masterpiece. Watched multiple times, still want to repeat it again and again.Zack snyder should get chance to continue his vision.", "Stop": "To the people that write these stories, please stop. There are many good ideas in this film. But as a whole, it is not good.", "For Autumn.": "I really loved this movie. Hats off to Zack Snyder and his entire team for making this beauty. Special Thanks to the VFX team who managed to produce 2600+ VFX shots in 7 months with perfection (while other movies take 1.5 years to finish them)", "Really fixes all the plot holes and problems with the last one": "I think this is maybe my top three best DCEU movie this far, the movie from 2017 with fine but it was missing something... And this one gave us exactly what the theatrical didn't. Bigger picture, each main character gets their moment (in Cyborg's case a few) and also it gave us finally the seventh member that we wanted to see!", "A much better cut": "This is miles better than the first version.It's engaging, the pacing is much better. There are different back stories introduced for characters, I though it was going to be a drag watching the same scenes again, it wasn't, I didn't even notice them.It has been almost totally recut. Loads of it has been reshot. Steppenwolf is also much better.It almost seems like you are watching an entirely new film.The film is divided into chapters. It feels like binge watching a mini-series. There is an interesting prologue for the next one at the end. Really good. Much improved. Look forward to the sequel.", "Works better for me if I think of it as a streaming series.": "I've already written a review of 2017's Justice League so I'll try not to repeat myself by bullet pointing what I think.Avengers: End Game convinced me that movies should be three and a half hours long. Justice League the Snyder cut did not convince me that a movie should be four hours long. As a flick, it was overblown and overstuffed. Snyder takes the slow part of the movie that explains their backgrounds and extended them, which would be fine but none of them are that interesting (Except for the Flash).Give it to Snyder, the movie is visually stunning. Makes me wish I could watch it on an IMAX screen instead of my screen at home which cuts off the sides. What I liked about the Snyder cut is that he took the time to visually tell a story and it looks better than the original.I'll say this, I know Joss Whedon is not favored right now , but I noticed everything I liked about the original cut seemed to be cut right out of the Snyder cut. A little amusing for me overall, but Joss had these moments in the film that made the godly DC superheroes more human . Just little one liners of humor that I felt this movie missed.While Wonder Woman seemed to be a focus of the original, most likely because her movie just dropped and was box office gold, the Snyder cut felt more even, with the exception of the Cyborg, whose story felt more key to the plot in this cut. Makes sense not just because of his origin but because if the Justice League was a success there is still a 50/50 spilt that he would have gotten a solo movie. We are still waiting for Flashpoint and I have no doubt we would have to wait longer for the Cyborg movie.Speaking off The Flash, still my fav out of all the heroes in the movie. Ezra Miller's stellar performance just holds up in both of the movies. Aquaman and Batman lost some thunder for me and like I said Cyborg got to shine, but no change in Baron Allen from the last cut to this one, which is good cause it was always good.Overall the question is weather was it worth it to even do a Snyder cut? I have to say, thinking about it as a eight episode streaming series rather than a four hour movie works way better for me. As strange as it was having those title cards that divided the parts like it was a comic book, it only helped me enjoy the binge watching experience.(plus that Epilogue was a fanboy sweet spot). At least I knew the best time to get up for a pee break.", "Finally - a Justice League movie that is worthy of its title and its lore": "No doubt that Warner Bros. has got to feel seriously embarrassed right now. Rather than let Zack Snyder finish his version of the movie in 2017 and consider delaying it to make sure it would be the best product possible they instead tinkered with it and enlisted Joss Whedon to try and make it into the kind of film it wasn't exactly striving to be in the first place. We all know how that version of the movie turned out - A Frankenstein-ian mess of a picture that in no way felt like an organic continuation to what was established prior and a mess in tone and continuity. At best, it was about on the level of either of the two Fantastic Four movies from 2005 and 2007 and X-Men: The Last Stand from 2006. This version however is closer to the level of a Winter Soldier, an Avengers, an Infinity War, an Endgame, an X-2, a Days of Future Past, a Logan, and The Dark Knight Trilogy - Not quite exactly on the same footing, but not too far from the same ballpark. Basically, everything that actually sort of worked in the 2017 Warner Bros. release works a lot better in this version, anything that may have not is either gone or improved a lot here as well. The tone is consistent, the writing is solid, the characters are all finely balanced, the tension, the drama, the spectacle are all handled very nicely. Obviously, being four hours long the runtime can be a bit problematic and there is a lot to take in all at once, I do think HBO Max should have considered at least giving the option to watch in either full or in parts but that is on the part of the streaming service algorithm than that of the product itself. I have but only two serious issues with it, one is regarding the quality of an acting performance and the other is in the presentation of the product. First things first, Amber Heard - Controversies aside, her accent is inconsistent with her performance in Aquaman, it felt very community theater level, fortunately she was not in it for very long. The second, while this is indeed a much more solid film than the 2017 release the DC fan in me is somewhat disappointed that we as comic fans and movie fans do not have a Justice League movie that can be enjoyed by a more wider range of demographics: The 2017 theatrical version is clearly going to be best enjoyed by children and middle schoolers, while this version will be best enjoyed and comprehended by adults. One wishes there was indeed a nice middle ground, but that's just being picky I suppose. Anyway, I definitely want to see more of where this is going based on the ending, and, hopefully, there is more come in the near future.", "Improvement": "Considering circumstances it's a miracle the final cut of this movie came out this good, it's pretty enjoyable. But the Justice League should have been a legendary movie and it's far from that. Wish DC or WB had made at least a roadmap before they started their EU.", "As a non believer in the Snyder Cut...I loved it": "I'm truly impressed with Zack Snyder's Cut! I wasn't expecting this movie, specially when I was left underwhelmed with his Dawn Of Justice's Cut.I never believe there was a Snyder Cut and neither was expecting this day, but I can guarantee you, this is a complete different movie. The story and plot devices aren't even the same, if that's possible.So many new scenes, important and meaningful scenes that don't feel rushed or out of context, as it happened with Whedon's version.I'm still amazed with Zack Snyder work on this project, and let me tell you, it's really a shame that Warner Brothers don't consider canon. The future possibilities that WB could work from here are immense.Can't wait to see what the future holds for Zack Snyder!", "Justice ... served?": "I know that ratings wise alone some will have already decided that they like my \"review\" or they don't like it (maybe even hate it). If by any chance you decided to hear me out, I will try to explain \"why\" I probably am taking the least popular vote/option when it comes to this new cut.First let me mention that I have no ill feelings towards Zack Snyder. One might even say that I am rather fond of his visual style of story telling (especially when it comes down to the graphic novel adaptation of 300 - which was based on Greek History/myths) - on the other hand one that has read some of my reviews is also aware that I was not the biggest fan of his Batman v Superman - and I watched the better longer cut of that. I don't even want to know what I would have made of the theatrical cut.Still and while there is no Martha gaffe here (there are others, some of which I'll mention), there are things I really liked about this and there are things that I didn't like. So for me a mix of both those versions would be a better movie than both of them individually. Because there are things I liked in the theatrical cut (aka Whedon cut), that Snyder took out. But there are also things in the Snyder Cut, that never made it into the theatrical cut.Of course back then (2017) Whedon had limitations - running time, budget restraints surely and trying to appease and please the powers to be. Now whatever one may think of Whedon, he is able to make an entertaining movie. As I stated back then, I don't think he succeded, which again I don't think was entirely his fault. Allegedly there was even screenings of his version versus the version Snyder had at the time and test audiences decided they liked the Whedon cut better ... you can take it up with them.I've written so much about the history of the movie and not that much about the movie itself. Let's dive into that and let's start with the positives. The movie is divided by chapters, which makes it easier digestible. It has a way better version of Steppenwolf and it contains another \"boss\" that was only briefly mentioned in the older cut. This movie has longer (duh) introductions to all the characters and especially Ray Fisher comes across way more, with his backstory and relationship to his parents fully explored. Almost an origin story within the wide and lengthy film then. Wonder Woman has quite the positive message to spead to young girls - but ... there is an issue, read below.Now the negative aspects, starting with the Wonder Woman message, just because I mentioned it lastly. The message is great, telling young girls they can be whatever they want to be when they grow up. Problem is not so much limitations in reality (always fight, always believe in yourself), but how it is delivered. The pandering aspect (which was critisized heavily in Endgame when the women got all together to fight .. together - you know female power and all that) would be excuseable too ... but the way this is delivered ... and I love Gal Gadot, but her ability to convey emotion in that and other dramatic scenes is either obliterated completely by her lack of acting \"powers\" and/or the fact that english isn't her first language, which leave the emotion lost in translation.Now I know that some may feel that is nitpicking, which is fair enough. I am just telling you that this is flawed. Another example is the Flash character. Which was the \"Joker\" of the group in the 2017 version and got more \"serious\" here. He still is akward funny, but has less moments that go that way. But apart from a creepy moment where he touches a womans hair while he is in - I'll call it hyper mode, I actually don't know what it is called to be frank - but anyway so he inappropriately touches another woman, which I reckon fan boys will excuse by saying it is a tender moment. Even that aside, what is worse is his moment as driver of a truck. Where the older version was done with it quickly, here we get an overdramatised event, that is far too long and gets a resolution that goes back to the silly Flash routine - which was not a part of the Whedon cut.CGI may be an issue for some. I didn't actually feel that way and maybe because I either got used to it or much of the money got used towards the end battle and the ending in general, the effects looked quite good there. Where both movies have issues are things like Wonder Woman using her truth lasso, asking a bad guy something and then explaining to the audience that he can't lie to her. Yes she is talking to the bad guy. but really she is telling us. Now that alone would be excuseable, but again pandering. And if they opted it was necessary to tell us, she should have started with explaining and then asking the bad guy. This way around it just doesn't work at all.The new version contains probably the best scene acting wise - it is between two women who should be included more in the movie, because of their talent. Amy Adams and Diane Keaton ... problem is even that scene undermines itself, just to please fans of a certain character and is taking away anything powerful the scene may have conjured up. And while I understand if you just like to will something great here (and visually there is quite a lot to enjoy, especially the end fight, even if that also takes away from the fights before if you really think about it), there is not one scene that can even come close to the level of emotion a simple sentence like \"love you 3000\" was able to get out of me and so many others who went on a different journey.In conclusion, I hope DC can up their game generally speaking and keep a certain level of quality. I love the Batman character so much, I am certain I will love the new movie with Pattinson too. But when it comes to connectivity and building a \"universe\", they should take a step back - get things going small and not throwing characters around and hoping it will stick ... to care for someone, we have to know that someone ... inevitable failure was programmed back in 2017 and of course Whedon wasn't going to concentrate on the characters we already knew and not the new members of the Justice League. Don't forget the Aquaman movie came out after this.If you read all this and I hope my grammar or typos were bearable, then congratulations! A lengthy movie was worth a lengthy review ... and you deserve my respect for reaching the end!Edit: adding a couple more things to elaborate on the rating or that make the picture clearer (no pun intended). Both versions have Aquaman loitering ... not anywhere but by throwing a bottle (crashing it so glass everywhere) into the sea. Only thing worse would have been if it had been a plastic bottle. But you know - it looks cool, especially in Slow Motion. The Snyder version adds the T-Shirt throwing/loitering. I imagine he must have a great collection of them, if he can throw them away every time he is on land (to look cool and to give the ladies and gents a look on his upper body).Talking about cool: Wonder Woman uses an \"explosion\" against a bad guy (only suggested not shown in the old cut) right in front of a lot of children. The scars this must give them ... not to mention the debris falling on humans below - yes no one gets hurt, but they could have. Not to mention the damage to the building (money wise) - but ... you know it: it looks cool.Steppenwolf as I already stated is a major improvement. The backstory he gets has issues. While it is a nice addition, the fact that the other boss does not get his hands dirty on the most important thing he wants to achieve is rather ... well not very smart now is it? But then again, if they can't remember the one place they've already been to ... the one place that has what they are looking for - the one place they actually should remember, instead of acting like Alzheimer Aliens that don't know what they did the other day ... again not smart or clever.And there are so many other things, that might be able to suck the fun out of something that obviously a lot liked so much they watched it more than once. And I am not the one to tell you how much you should care about those things that I consider flaws. If you don't mind them, if you had a blast, good for you. And I wholeheartedly mean it. But if I didn't write what I thought of it, it wouldn't be a review - rather pandering - and you know I don't do that", "Far superior...": "When Justice League arrived it was like DC was trying to cram a decade of Movies into a 2hr movie. A desperate attempt to outdo Avengers... It lacked character development, it seemed rushed and incomplete.By comparison Zach Snyders cut has produced something far more developed, whole and soulful.This is the movie they should have released....", "This is the right JL": "Putting aside the crazy 4 hr length just go watch it. Watch it in 2 sittings. This is what JL should have been. Awesome movie!", "masterpiece": "I cannot get enough of this masterpiece, I just want to see more of it", "Hugely overrated film": "It's average action movie at best. The Transformers on steroid.My head hurts after it ends.", "Justice for the League": "The first thing that catches the attention of 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' is that an aspect ratio of 1.33: 1 has been chosen, which generates an almost completely square image, contrary to the panoramic vision that predominates in the superhero genre. This already gives us a sign that we are before an author and that what will come next is one hundred percent his, different from what is usual in this type of cinema but probably very similar to the previous works of his creator.From this on, everything continues to get closer and closer to the visual and narrative style that Snyder handles. We find a much darker, gray staging and a much slower and more dramatic narrative pulse.Visually takes your breath away by how Snyder builds such perfectly thought-out (for the superhero genre) and so expressive shots. The images take the viewer to another level, as had already been seen in 'Batman V Superman', where the visual aspect and the photography work was one of his greatest strengths.These factors influence the film to acquire a unique atmosphere in the genre. Snyder is, for better or for worse, an author and as such this film is handled in a way that represents his vision of the superhero genre and how he understands comics and cinema, allowing himself to be carried away by the most characteristic elements of the film. Those long static shots or those long slow-motion sequences that dramatize the situations are present once again here.It is inevitable not to compare this movie with the previous version of him. And despite the fact that much of the plot changes substantially, making it practically another movie, there are still several sequences that were in Joss Whedon's version.However, all these well-known sequences take on a greater dramatic weight, largely due to the montage and level of emotionality that Snyder adds to the scene.The slowdown in editing and narration leaves much more time for there to be a greater exploration of each character. In this sense, the four hours of duration have been useful to give more space to its protagonists and develop the plots. The focus is no longer almost completely focused on Batman or Wonder Woman as before, but each character takes on more dimensions, sometimes with only small details or conversations that add a lot to his stories and personalities.Special attention to Cyborg and Flash, the first takes on an impressive importance and development and the second loses a bit that silly side that it had before. Without detracting from Steppenwolf either, which although it still does not have great foundations, works much better here.Not that everything works perfectly in 'Zack Snyder's Justice League', in fact it still has things that do not work at all. The problem again lies in Snyder's need to include more than he should. There comes a point in the plot where so many elements are being included for future sequels that they steal the spotlight from the central story. I will not go into details, but that need to include so much in the same film has always been the problem that characterizes the films of the DC Universe and especially 'Batman V Superman', which is what this new film is most like.But despite this, Snyder manages to move the story forward and reach some really powerful levels of drama and epicity in its third act.It is quite admirable what Zack Snyder has achieved with this film. From a movie that was one of the worst the genre has seen in recent years, he has managed to impress and silence more than one. I recognize myself as someone who had no faith in this movie and I ended up swallowing my words about what could go wrong. Because certainly, it has turned out more than well. 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' is a gift to the entire DC Universe, delivering a well-deserved movie for his characters, with tremendous images that flow across the screen in an amazing way. It is true that it has a point of pretense, but it is forgivable considering that we are facing one of the great works of the genre and how well it came to get away from the classic aesthetics of a superhero film. It is a triumph.", "About to make my own damn cut.": "There just HAS to be a happy medium between the theatrical release and this overstuffed burrito of a film. Don't get me wrong - this is definitely the better version and I love the idea of sticking it to WB, Geoff Johns and Joss Whedon as much as the next nerd but frankly neither director found a way to turn this mess into something digestible.The cancer that plagued the theatrical cut has only metastasized in the Snyder cut. Both command the viewer to just pretty please understand how high the stakes are. Where there should be drama and tension, there's mindless action and exposition. The \"superhero moments\" don't hit. Every single scene overstays it's welcome and levity has been completely shoehorned into the clumsiest places. Such an exhausting... I want to say disappointment but frankly I wasn't expecting it to be particularly good to begin with.Thanks for more Cyborg and Flash, though. Let the \"not helpful\" votes begin!P.S. sweet Jesus just shoot the DCEU into the sun and start again. It's okay to admit that you've fudged it up to this point. The characters deserve better.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is stylish and epic, it's the intended version and a incredible film": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is the intended version that Zack Snyder wanted to be released back in 2017, for all these years it was only a pipe dream but it came true thanks to HBO Max. The Snyder Cut (Director's Cut) is as epic as Lord of the Rings, the scale. But it isn't as great as that trilogy but maybe it could have come close if Snyder got the opportunity to finish his Justice League trilogy.\nThe Snyder Cut is almost four hours long, that might be to long for some people but you can easily watch it as a mini series, the pacing is actually great.Zack Snyder is an expert of subtle world building as we saw in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, but with the latter and Justice League we get to see how great he truly is. He takes these four hours and makes it slow, we get to follow a lot of characters, even Steppenwolf and see his reasons for doing all of this plus learning more of him and his world.\nThis is my opinion here, you are free to have another. But I find the story and screenplay to be near perfection, though there should have been solo movies before this but I get why there weren't. Their introduction in this film works fine and they do set up further stories for their individual story arcs. Chris Terrio and Zack Snyder have created a phenomenal story that kept me engaged and entertained, if you like the superheroes and world then I'm sure you'll like the story. It's also put a smile on my face how much they know about the comics, it's faithful to the comic books. The dialogue is fantastic, and the actors delivers the lines superbly.\nRegarding the comedy, I actually enjoyed it more in this than Whedon as it felt more natural, I think the writers succeeded in the jokes. Some background on that, DC Films wanted Justice League to not be as dark as Batman v Superman, there was a darker version of the script before they changed. I think they did the right choice, the movie is still dark and gritty but a touch of hope and well placed jokes throughout helped in a team based movie like Justice League.\nThe costume department did a phenomenal job, the whole production design was impressive.Action sequences. Wonder Woman had some of the best action sequences, honestly every hero had their moment to shine but Wonder Woman and Superman are the most impressive in terms of power they have, Snyder knows how to shoot fight sequences for them.\nThe fight sequence underneath Gotham Harbor is a highlight and simply epic in this version in comparison to Whedon's, it just feels a more personal fight after the large build up and the time we have watched Steppenwolf, I no longer see him as a one dimensional villain like I did in the previous version and honestly he were, Zack Snyder's love for the characters and story shows in both the heroes and villains. Great writing. I also think it's better visual effects in this version, can't explain why or I'm just remembering it wrong.\nThe other notable fight sequence is the final battle between the heroes and Steppenwolf where Darkseid plays a small part, the grand scale of the battle and how epic it is, it's a major part of why I love it but the main reason is how the Justice League uses their powers and how they're working together, and The flash.One thing you should know about Zack Snyder is that he's a visionary director and very stylish so each scene is extremely well shot. Award worthy cinematography.\nThe music is astonishing, Junkie XL is talented and possibly one of the best in the business.Cyborg is the heart of the movie as much as Zack Snyder is the heart of this production, two men who lost so much but continues to fight. Ray Fisher plays Victor Stone/Cyborg and his performance is perfect, both acting wise and the character that many people love, he did the role with justice. Seeing his full character arc for the first time was amazing and probably one of the highlights of the film, best live-action performance of the character.Ben Affleck's Batman arc. He got hope again after the depression and PTSD he clearly suffered from in Batman v Superman, it's nice to see this portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman to be more hopeful and finding another family of sorts, you can clearly see that he cares for people again or at least his team. It's a brilliant performance by Affleck and its sad he never got to make his Batman trilogy.The Flash is great in this film, we get to see his backstory play out and it's nice. Ezra Miller actually has potential to be a great Flash, I had my doubts in Whedon's version but I'm sold after this film and it got me hyped for his solo movie. The beloved hero has some new abilities as well, or old ones as we saw him in the future in Batman v Superman.Henry Cavill described Superman as he appears in Snyder's Justice League as completing his character arc that began with Man of Steel and becoming the \"true\" Superman as depicted in the comics. Snyder also said while he loves the traditional portrayals of the character, he wanted Superman to have a realistic arc and develop as a character, and not be a \"one-dimensional Boy Scout\". I appreciate that, a lot actually. If I wanted a traditional portrayal I would read a comic, Henry Cavill's flawed Superman got me interested and have kept me interested. Job well done. I also want to go into the resurrection of Clark Kent/Superman, they played out quite the same but Zack Snyder's version fleshed it out and honestly everything makes perfect sense, it's like Whedon got everything wrong about the character until the end of the film.\nI also want to add about all the scenes featuring Lois Lane, I read a review from a well known critic and he said something that there were lots of scenes that could have been cut and trimmed down, watching the film now I see what he meant and the Lois Lane scenes could have been trimmed or cut fully but the critic didn't get the film or the 5-film plan. As The Flash from the future said in Batman v Superman, Lois is the key. Lois Lane is the most important character of these films and her presence was needed to slow things down a bit, I also loved how casual the scenes were as it shows how human she is.If you like a more lighthearted, comedic and honestly a less cinematic film of the superhero genre then pick Joss Whedon's version as it's more like the MCU, what I want to say is that it's for a larger audience, early teens which the Snyder Cut isn't for because of well the R-Rating.\nMartin Scorsese have said multiple of times that he doesn't see superhero films as cinema and I get his opinion, nothing is almost never at stakes with the MCU movies but are they entertaining to watch? They are.\nI'm just sad that we never got to see this film of cinematic brilliance at the cinema which it was intended, but we got to see it in its intended form.The Knightmare sequence, Zack Snyder you are one clever man. It was excellent and Jared Leto's brief performance as Joker was perfect so I wonder why we got that weird villain in Suicide Squad, this was Joker.\nIf Zack Snyder's Justice League is successful which it probably will be for HBO Max, why not give Snyder an opportunity to make the anticipated sequel with a slightly lower budget than he normally gets. I would watch it on day one like I did with this one.", "Better than the original, but still overated": "I really don't get why so many people gives this 10/10???\nWhen i compare to most marvel movies, this is seriously overated imo", "Superman didnt need the black suit": "In the comics the black suit is called the \"Recovery suit\" given to him after he came back from the dead from his fight with Doomsday. The black suit is suppose to consume radiation, providing him an easy way to absorb radiation quickly.In this Snyder cut, it was never explained why Superman needed the black suit. He gets resurrected and he still had his powers at 100% when he fought his Justice League friends. Snyder fans didnt pay attention. If we are gonna go by comic book logic regarding the black suit then it makes no sense, it was pointless. The Black suit is simply there for Superman to look cool.The 2017 made sense in having his traditional Super suit after he was resurrected.", "Restore the Snyderverse now!!!": "This is what we deserved and much more, I'm clamming for a Snyderverse restoring. The fight scenes are magic, thanks to special effects very well executed. It's almost pointless to compare it with the 2017 one, since Snydercut is basically an entire new movie. A strong point to me is Superman not doing everything and erasing the rest of the time, there's focus on every principal character. Also, Cyborg has been deepened, his story finally told properly. The scene with Luthor and Slade? Wow! I barely felt the four hours, was so entreated that didn't want it to end.Please, Warner, make this canon and let ZS work!!!", "The JL we deserved": "This is the film I was waiting since many years ago, and not that piece of crap we had.\nThis is the definitive JL film, the one I love. A piece of art.\nSomebody at WB should investigate what happens inside their productions. They easily derails. Leave directors work, and production people, do not interfere them.", "Not the perfect movie some make it out to be, but far superior to the 2017 version": "Once again you see that if you muddle too much with somebody's vision in hindsight all you get is an incoherent mess. And that's exactly what happened a few years ago with justice league when reactionary execs tried to change something after a story outline had already been put in place.The Joss Whedon version was mildly put at least forgettable since many story beats just didn't add up or were simply misplaced. However nothing that would upset fans. Only so much that you could get some money from it and no one cares afterwards about it.Now coming to the Snyder Cut. The most important thing about this version is that you see a clear vision behind this and that it makes sense and clearly sets up well the other movies in this universe. It's grimmer but has heart. It's way longer but the characters make actually sense in their behavior. It's a coherent story with a satisfying ending. The characters actually have arcs and are three dimensional. Especially Steppenwolf and Cyborg profit immensely from this.The CGI looks actually better and without the moustache Superman scenes you actually stay in the movie and not start laughing.There's a few story points you could improve or cut in order for this to flow a bit better but you actually never get bored or think that this movie drags. You stay invested.Overall a far superior movie than the 2017 version.Looking at it in a vacuum and ignoring that version it's a nice continuation of the universe and solid build up for the coming movies which won't come unfortunately. If you're a fan it's a must watch. If you've at least seen the other movies it's definitely worth a peek.", "Really good version": "An epic and effective superhero film. I saw the cinema version of the movie a long time ago, but this director's cut version is long but justified like the Batman vs. Superman version was. The themes and characters are thus deepened and do not detract from the action.", "The different endings it had made it more suspenseful and make you look forward to the next one": "This movie was a great movie, I ain't gonna cap or lie. I Like how it expanded more on the first justice League to make parts that didn't make a lot of sense make sense, it also changed the fighting scenes and got everyone involved in all the action perfectly. Strongly recommending u watch the 2017 one first and then Snyder's cut", "Longer and easier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "More action than the theatrical version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Snyder delivered a fully realized vision": "This is superhero movie making at its finest. Every scene flows smoothly and thematically with a slow build of tension. The backstory of each character is so well fleshed out. As Snyder himself said - \"All the arcs are there and completed.\" Music selections are excellent. Joss Whedon butchered a masterful movie, I'm so glad we got to see the restored vision. Considering all the masterfully filmed deleted scenes, it looks like the overrated Whedon rolled dice in the cutting room. Tremendous contextual background was omitted from each character.\nSuperman's death cry at the start sent chills down my spine. From then on actions move in rapid succession. The bank heist with Wonder Woman restored my faith in the fighting prowess, courage and sacrifice of the character, after the drivel of Ww84. The massacre of the amazons had really disturbed me before but this version was far harsher, brutal and savage. Newfound respect for the courage and spirit of the warrior women. Steppenwolf had been ridiculed in the previous abomination, here you can appreciate the true horrific majesty of this Uber demon. The first age battle was impressive but Darkseid himself was a disappointment. All the more reason to rue the vanishing of the old alliance.\nThe moral quandary of cheating death and restoring superman was sufficiently explored. These are significant ethical concerns. Flash definitely stole the spotlight with smooth fast moves at all the right times, pun intended. We also finally see Batman at his combat prime as he takes on a legion of parademons alone, much like the gameplay we enjoyed in the Arkham series. The background of Aquaman is explored further, laying groundwork for his own movie later. And Cyborg's arc was most poignant, given the personal loss and tragedy he suffered, and his integral relationship with the mother boxes.\nIn the overall picture yes the movie did drag at 4 hours, but I was satisfied - very much like an endless 10 course meal - you have to finish to get the full experience, palate and variety the chef intended. It's a shame a new controversy has erupted - to continue the Snyderverse or not. Even his detractors must admit - Snyder delivered a fully realized vision.", "Boring from the very start. Why? Because more and more CGI effects numb my brain. Even superhero movies should always be about the CHARACTERS and NOT the special effects!": "What a boring mess from the start. Did they forget that even a superhero movies should always be about the CHARACTERS first most and NOT only about the CGI special effects.The bad: the producers forgot (?) that LESS IS MORE. Unfortunately we get nothing else but continuous (rather unimpressive) special effects and almost no real human character development or story to speak of.Who can stand to watch this for hours on end? I can not. Honest.", "It's actually decent": "I'm not really a DC or a Marvel fanboy, all these comic book movies have become a bit tiring lately. I don't really appreciate Zack Snyder as a director, and I think the 2017. version of the movie was a disaster, so my expectations were pretty low when I started watching this movie. I was actually pleasantly surprised after I watched it.The first hour and a half of the movie are actually pretty boring, and feature some laughable special effects (the fight scene with the amazons), but it provides some much needed backstory for the characters which the first movie lacked, and makes the second half of the movie work much better. Some scenes were really tacky, and featured music that seemed out of place, and I think that 40% of this movie consists of slo-mo shots, which is unnecessary.When the movie actually starts it's pretty good, the fight scenes mostly look great, it's all fast, flashy, nicely choreographed, has great music and a heart.Having said that, the biggest differentiating factor between the two versions of the movie is the added backstory. I think it's a bit unfair to bash Josh Whedon's version which had to be shorter in order to work as a theatrical release, and praise this version which had the luxury to be 1.5 hours longer. Let's be real, Zack Snyder wouldn't be able to make it work either confined to a 2.5 hours long theatrical release.All in all a decent way to spend a lazy evening, nothing more, nothing less.", "Well done": "This movie was incredible, 4 hours epic masterpiece which purely gave treat and justice to all the fans.There is great character growth for everyone. Each individual felt important and had a purpose, all fell into right place.Zack Snyder did amazing and was well worth the effort.#DC.", "Greek mythology at its best": "\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7magnificent.sometimes there is a greek history and mythology precisely from the book.", "I'm a satisfied fan": "Way better than Whedon's. The climax has been improved so much. The earlier one was an easy finish after Superman comes in. Here he keeps it interesting until the end. Also many forced lame 1-liners added to color up the mood of the film by Whedon, have been thankfully removed and replaced with the consistent tones of dark drama.This film can stand alone without the background of MoS or BvS. The 4 hours allow time to expand on characters and the plot better. At no point you'll be questioning the joining dots. All loose ends seemed to have been tied well.Yes there are many empowering super hero moments, but none that give you the feel of Captain America taking the Hanmer in Endgame. The other complain I have is with the music. There is no innovativeness, it's the same recycled super hero music one would have heard in so many films/tv shows. It's extremely bland. There are some musical moments here or there with Wonder Woman but again it's not as good as the Wonder Woman film.Batman also seems to have been under utilized, I would have wanted to see him stylishly bashing some skulls and throwing some punches as he did in BvS.I am a fan of Snyders stylish slo-mos and close ups. He hasn't used too many here, starts with some and then goes on normal mode until the end.Either way, I'm a satisfied fan.", "The Prime Rib that we deserved!!!!...": "This movie is Prime Rib compared to Joss Whedon's chopped up pile of chub they first fed us!!!! Joss Whedon literally chewed up that movie and SPAT IT AT US.... BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN!!! Yes, this version may be long, but it is definitely worth it. So, much more is explained and there's just more depth and feeling throughout this experience! It's heartfelt, fun and gritty!", "Lame": "No ending. No resolution. No arcs. No personal or social development. Minimum comedy. Half of it is in slow-motion (lame).\"It's not a movie, it's just scenes.\" - Arin Hansen.", "Bravo to the designers of Steppenwolf": "My favorite comic book movie of all time. But have to say this Steppenwolf is the baddest and best villain ever created. Couldn't get enough of him!", "Let Snyder finish the story": "This version was multiple times better than the one released in 17. The studio needs to let Snyder finish his vision and stop getting in the way.", "I don't think that this movie is perfect but it is clos4": "JL Whedon:\nFive of the strongest people on earth gather together to cry about Supermans death. They resurrect him to make themselves obsolete and completely kill the peril that made the story. Moral of the story? The five are worthless. Only one guy can save the earth and he doesn't even have to try.JL Snyder:\nFive of the strongest people on earth come together to make a team and fight a threat, they resurrect Superman and all six of them prove their worth as they enter a battle to save the planet. Not one of them is disposable and the loss of any would doom them all. Moral of the story? Everyone has a part to play and only as a team is success possible.I'm sorry but as a DC fan, I found Whedon's interpretation of the universe insulting. The whole movie may as well have been titled \"Superman doesn't need friends!\" He didn't even struggle against Steppenwolf. Once Clark showed up the momentum just died.Compare that the Snyders cut, if Supes hadn't shown up they still would have lost but the same can be said for every member of the team. All six of them had to be at the battle, all six of them had to give their all and had to be a team, which is what the Justice League is, it's a team of people who all need each other.The Whedon version showed that Joss has no feel for what DC is and/or that he's a Superman fanboy. No hate for Joss Whedon! Firefly is one of my all-time favorite shows and he did good with Marvel films, but he either doesn't like DC or decided to point out the flaw of Supes being too strong by bashing the story with that hammer. Either way, Joss should stick with Marvel and his own creations and never touch DC again.I hope that if they continue with the universe that they will base it off of Snyders version and pretend Whedon doesn't exist. Or they can continue with Whedon's vision and call it \"Supermans Story\".They can end it like Smallville and just have Clark fly up and push Apokolips away without him even facing Darkseid. As we all know that's the way we want that fight to go.Sorry about the Smallville spoiler but if you haven't watched it yet you don't really care and I just spared you the worst series ending of any show ever.", "Wow this is one of the best dc movies": "Wow this is one of the best dc movie out there especially the action scenes and visual effects very well done. And the characters has a better backstory and the villain is actually threatening. This should have been released instead of the shed on cut and no soap ores drama.", "Goosebumps. Best Superhero flick": "Absolutely loved it. I've been converted from a Marvel to a DC fan. The aspect ratio was a big let down by me. Why Snyder. They could have at least given us the option to change it on the bluray like we switch audio formats.", "EPIC 4 hours and 2 minutes.": "It follows the same dense, dark movie idea and emo and depressive characters from \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v Superman\". Even so, this is a much lighter film than the previous ones; so much so that the hours are not noticeable and they go by quickly. Diana is all an Amazon war, not the weak one they presented to us in WW84, Batman is no longer a walking joke, here if he is rude. Well developed characters, unexpected cameos and gory film. The soundtrack is another plus that gives everything an epic touch. Very good movie that should have been released 3 years and 4 months ago in cinema (that is, November 2017).", "Understanding story": "4 hr Movie Quite Long But I Didn't get Bore In Any Place, Also Understanding Story But The main Thing I specially Like Is The background which is much Better than the 2017 justice league.Zack you Nailed It \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25.", "Take some time for this": "Its a very long movie.

I enjoyed it pretty much but sometimes its too much contemplative.", "Super awesome film, but bit let down coz of the 4:3 format...": "Ok, without a doubt it's an superb film. This film literally can teach you what actually a good editing can do, it changed the whole film. The theatrical version and this version, studio should have released this version instead of the crappy one. Audience don't care about a long lengthy film if it doesn't feel like one. Anyways one very big complain I have with this film is the 4:3 aspect ratio, I mean why man! We don't want to see letter box format anymore, that's why we bought costly 4k TVs. This format is the biggest let down of this film. This film should have a wide format. Hopefully studio will release a wide screen format some time in the future.", "Great Hero Movie tie....Except": "Loved it BUT...I absolutely hate the 4:3 picture ratio!Makes me wanna strangle Zack Snyder for choosing this!The movie was great with the usual thrilling action packed scenes and scenarios.Begins with other hero movie snippets.Longest movie aside from gone with the wind.Must see to keep the hero movies in order.Dang that screen! >:/", "The best DC movie till date": "Overall Opinion-\nAlthough the competitors Marvel have a well organised way of strategic movie releases and have excelled till date.This DC movie is just marvellous that even a neutral comic book audience can enjoy and also the characters in this movie are thoroughly portrayed their personalities and their motives are clear unlike the predecessor of this movie making it a perfect version of a movie.Review-\nThe movie has a strong sense of the impact created from the previous movie and also how the world revolves around the impact is clearly shown very early itself.\nThe pacing of the movie is excellent so much so that it doesn't seem like a 4 hour movie.If Marvel fans want to compare pacing lets just say being a neutral comic book fan myself the pacing can be compared to The Winter Soldier which is one the best movies too.\nEach characters motives including the antagonist are clearly portrayed and the story telling is so compelling that u feel for those characters.\nCGI is great in many scenes but only in some scenes are where u can have a lacking sense but overall it was good.\nThis movie actually feels like a compelling story of a comic book rather than its predecessor which felt like a popcorn movie.\nIt had a great beginning and a end where u want more of it and the character development was excellent throughout.\nA Great movie for the fans who waited for years and a good compelling story driven movie for the neutral comic book audience .", "How it should have been done": "This alternate version is much better than the first Justice League. Zack Snyder brought his game in this beautifully paced film. Nice to see his vision and aesthetic come to life.", "Just watch it...": "\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch the director's cut of \"Justice League\". Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg join their forces in order to protect Earth from an enemy and ensure that Superman's sacrifice was not for nothing.Since I had already watched \"Justice League\" I though that I knew what I was about to watch but I was mistaken. \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is the ultimate DC movie and it's completely different than \"Justice League\". It was like I was watching a different movie, with new information and better plot. The interpretations of Ben Affleck who played as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Gal Gadot who played as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince, Jason Momoa who played as Aquaman / Arthur Curry, Ezra Miller who played as The Flash / Barry Allen and Ray Fisher who played as Cyborg / Victor Stone. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Henry Cavill's who played as Superman / Clark Kent and he was also very good. To sum up, I have to say that \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is a nice, interesting movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it even if you have already watched \"Justice League\" of 2017.", "The same bad movie but twice as painful": "?!?! Who thought it was a good idea to make a movie this long without adding anything of value. Don't waste your time.", "One of the coolest movies ever made": "I've watched it 2 times so far and I wish I could get the experience of watching it for the first time back.This is by far the best superhero movie after the dark knight. After 4 hours of it I wished there was more.", "Beatiful storyline and well executed but lacks in many ways": "Before I start writing about Zack Snyder's Justice League; let me put my opinion here first.Watchmen is still Snyder's top DC movie and 2nd best superhero movie ever made after The Dark Knight.Alright... let's talk about this movie then.What I loved:Storyline and the direction. Each sequence, very well detailed and beautifully executed. Especially Cyborg's future vision of all JL members are killed, Darkseid has won and Superman turns evil. Also the last sequence - Bruce's nightmere; the angry Mera...Darkseid - Zack has perfectly nailed him. Those flaming eyes after killing King Arthur and the Omega Beams... Man just loved it. (Uxas version was alright though).Steppenwolf - CGI was really good - both, with and without the armour. I prefer his face without the armour though - it looked more natural.Cyborg - was never a fan of him but liked his dark character and the way he's come out as one of the universe's main links.Cameos and future build ups - never thought that Flash would reverse the timeline this quickly which now opens up all new possibilities for DCEU to grow. Also loved how Martian Manhunter now starts showing up more often, Ryan Choi - takes charge of nano technology division of Star Labs, and a little cameo of dead Killowog in Bruce's nightmare sequence (and dead Supergirl in Superman's arms in Cyborg's vision?)What I hated:Overall CGI - not convinced. May be Zack didn't have enough time and budget? Most of the Flash's scenes didn't look right. i.e Barry's shoes tearing, Barry saving Iris in slow mo, Iris' car blowing, and most of the Victor's visions when he goes to different places - didn't look real at all. Also, Flash's running is still weird.Overall movie tone and color grading - No! Weren't up to Zack's standards.I felt like Superman got very less time on screen. Henry deserved more.Martian Manhunter - looked TV Series level average. Needed more darker skin tone, may be some height and body structure modifications to more look like an alien and less human, and a serious look.Background score - It didn't disconnect me from any of the scenes so was not terrible; but also, I'm not humming any of the soundtracks back in my brain so was not great either. Most of them were from the past movies.4:3 aspect ratio - I know Zack had a solid reason behind this and it might have worked well if the movie was released in theatres especially in IMAX. However, not many countries have IMAX, and on TV, our eyes are trained to see 16:9 ratio so those black bars on the sides were quite disturbing.So... my rating would be 7/10 (almost gave 6.5 but I'll do some partiality here being a DC and Snyder fan). \ud83d\ude0a", "This version is much much better however it still has it's problems !!": "To be fair I am still amazed to be sitting here actually typing a review to Zack Snyder's cut of Justice League, it does feel a bit weird almost like a dream. Like most people after witnessing the frankensteins monster of a film which was the 2017 version created by Warner Bros and the man who shall not be named, I was very interested to see what the Snyder cut would actually look like. Personally had a lot of questions going in, how much different would it be from the 17 version, same story arc, same storylines etc........I have to admit though, that yes majority of my questions did get answered however it did leave me with more new questions!!First and foremost is the \"Snyder cut\" better and or any different from its predecessor ? 100% YES !! I am totally shocked how different the two films really are, yes is there some connective tissue.....of course there was going to be. However there are huge chunks of this film that were completely excluded from the 17 version and I don't know why. The basic story is more or less the same however it is told in completely new way by focusing on different characters more. Of course with the enormous runtime of 4 hours you are going to have the time to build characters more in depth than you do with a 2 hour film. For the majority most of the changes are for the good of the film, the story is much more interesting and each of the characters feels much more fleshed out.The team felt warranted. This version definitely makes the joining of the team feel much more plausible and natural than the 2017 version did. The interactions between each of the characters was so so good to see and definitely lacking from the other version. That is ultimately due to the fact that the script is written better by Snyder and whoever else had a hand in writing hahaha (I can't remember). Its not just because all the awkward jokes have been removed (there actually some good new laughs in this version) the film flows much much better with the slow pace. Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg all feel much more fleshed out and connected to one another, rather than just thrown together to save the day. Plus ancillary characters like Lois Lane, Alfred, Barry Allen's Dad (yikes i cant remember his name, oh and cyborgs dad as well *face palm*) all play their part.What is the biggest plus of the Snyder cut and is it worth watching ? For me personally (Apart from all of the above) the biggest plus was making Steppenwolf a much more intimidating and interesting villain. There is much more to the character this time around then the 17 version, I understand his motives more now. Plus he does have a personality of sorts, not just some robotic villain, which Darkseid sadly becomes haha. Was it worth having to sit for all 4 hours of this film, I'd say yes and no. Yes because I have now seen what Mr Snyder originally intended for this film. However it is does have its issues, firstly being far far too long......unnecessarily long!! Plus the ending 20 minutes just felt like scenes thrown together without much guide as to what they mean. Also some of the extra scenes don't need to be in this film, could easily been under 3 hours 30 minutes.Overall I'd say I'm a bit sad actually because originally Justice League was meant to be in 2 parts then got changed to 1 and now has been fleshed out to this extended version. Which ultimately signals the end of Snyder's involvement with Warner Bros and DC, which is annoying because I would have like to see what was next. Bringing Superman back, adding Martian Manhunter (weird cameo) and setting up a big fight with Darkseid which will now not happen. All of this is Warner Bros problem as they created the mess starting all the way back with changing their mind on Snyder mid-cinematic world building. What happens moving forward ?? Robert Pattinson is now Batman, doesn't look like Henry Cavill is coming back as Superman, No word on Green Lantern, Is Wonder Woman 3 happening ??, The Flash film has been in development hell, Is Ray Fisher still gonna be Cyborg and will Darkseid appear in future films ??I'm glad I saw this and its a good film 75% out of 100........its not great and definitely not perfect. However I'm happy that I got the chance to see it and thats good enough for me !!", "The REAL, TRUE, ACTUAL Justice League Movie": "The REAL, TRUE, ACTUAL movie has arrived, 4hrs of character driven gold as it should be by the man himself Zack Snyder.Now this was movie I expected to see in 2017 when I went to the cinema but instead thanks to the haters and critics I was greeted with bad cgi superman and Joss Whedons bad attempt at a Justice League movie by making Wonder Woman yell, a batman who plain gave up, a booyah cyborg, an idiot flash and aquaman going bonkers, not to mention steppen \"mother oh where art tho mother, let me kiss the tip mother\" wolf.Thankfully a long campaign to get the real true movie out was successful, and I am glad it was. My memory of the 2017 movie made for the haters and critics was completely washed away thanks to this true release, and what a release it is.Not only do we get more scenes of superman but also we also get the proper face, we get a determined and confident batman willing to fight, we have the true villain of steppenwolf and his motives are better, darkseid shows up, we get a better backstory and introduction to cyborg and the flash, speaking of flash he is more of a hero in this than a goof in Joss Whedons version. Cyborg is an absolute badass, aquaman's story also ties in well with his solo movie after meeting with vulko. Wonder Woman is like she was in her first solo movie.....awesome.Hands down Zack Snyder's Justice League is an absolute masterpiece for DC and compliments well with MOS and BvS UE to complete the trilogy as a whole.", "Daughter and Dad!": "We loved it. I loved watching it with my 10 year old. She thought it was cool, awesome and loved that it was 4 hours. When I was 10 more than 30 years ago would have loved watching this with my dad. So watching it with her was the best thing ever. It is a great movie to watch with the family on the weekends!", "Best dceu movie.": "I haven't seen the theatrical cut yet.

I wasn't a believer, didn't think Snyder would pull it off, but boy was I wrong!The visionary look, style, vibe, feel & trademarks of a great Zack Snyder film is so evident here, you begin to realize why WB gave him more money to direct it. They were absolutely right! The magic touch of Snyder is back with full force & I can't recommend it enough!DC is on top again & Marvel can take a backseat for now lol. Please all you DC haters, just accept defeat for now, (they're both great companies) and take part in witnessing a truly masterpiece of a film! Thanks Zack & WB, you did it once again!", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an excellent rethink of not the most successful crossover": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an excellent rethink of not the most successful crossover. Of course, I don't understand how you can shoot in 2021 with a 4:3 aspect ratio, but you also need to evaluate the picture and changes in the plot that reveal it. In the updated version, the characters and their motivation are better revealed, and the timing was hardly damaged. The directorial style of Zach Snyder is felt from the first minutes, a successful film from DC.", "This is... a good movie.": "So here's some perspective on where I'm coming at this from: I haven't seen any movies leading up to this. The last DC movies I saw were Dark Knight and Superman Returns, which aren't even part of this universe. Everything I know about these characters comes from osmosis from my comics-reading buddies, or what I remember from the old KidsWB cartoons in the late 90's and early 2000's.So in that context... I think I enjoyed Zack Snyder's Justice League. It is a good movie. I don't even think I have to qualify that. It's just a good movie.It is also four hours long, and I don't know if I'll ever watch it a second time. It was good enough to satisfy my curiosity as to what this thing even was, and I was definitely entertained by the movie, but I don't know if it's worth quite the glitz and the glamor and the weight of its four hour run time. To tell the truth, I'm still figuring that part out. It's more complex than a black or white judgement.This movie is unabashedly Zack Snyder's. Dude was given a second chance and leaned all the way in to every stereotype people think of him for. Epic chanting, slow motion, a washed out color palette, and deeply self-serious subject matter. There is no mistaking who made this movie, because his fingerprints are all over everything.But, y'know, he's made good movies with this stuff before, and some of it definitely benefits Justice League. If you're going to put The Flash in to a movie, you're going to need lots of slowmo. Batman is, by his nature, a pretty self-serious character, so the tone works. And Zack Snyder knows what makes a good action scene. If there's anything this guy is known for, it's good action.And to be fair to the movie's four hour run time, Justice League crams in at least two movies worth of content. WB is trying to skip the very slow burn of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and jump ahead to doing their version of \"Avengers End Game\", so having a very long movie that covers a lot of ground helps that, a bit. In some ways it even accomplishes things better than the MCU -- Marvel's \"Infinity War\" was an extremely dense movie that required multiple viewings to properly digest the events of it's 15+ main characters. Snyder's Justice League is a far more coherent story, undoubtedly thanks to a smaller cast that's given more room to stretch out.I don't have many complaints except for the fact that in addition to being a Justice League movie, this is basically an origin movie for The Flash and Cyborg, and of the two, Cyborg gets 90% of the origin. They don't ruin The Flash or anything like that, but it's the sort of thing where his role and his powers make a lot more sense if you already know about him from other media, because despite the fact he plays a pivotal role in this movie, they don't do a very good job explaining who he is, what he can do, or what his limits are.It's also got a really slow opening. It spends a lot of time getting all of its ducks in a row, and the act of doing so makes up some of the most awkward parts of the movie. Justice League carries itself like it's the savior of the DCEU, and to an extent it is, but that means enduring a bit of a grind in order to set up the rest of the movie. It's necessary housekeeping, and the Snyder Cut wouldn't work without establishing this stuff, but it doesn't exactly hit the ground running. You have to wait for it to build enough momentum to hit its stride.And I just keep going back to the fact that it's four hours long. It's really hard to justify setting aside that much time for even the best of the best of the best, and Justice League certainly isn't the best -- it's just merely solid. It's a popcorn movie that will make you sick of eating popcorn by the end. It may have been shot for IMAX theaters, but it's definitely best viewed at home where you have a pause button handy for whatever may require it. I'm glad I saw it, I'm glad it was actually a good movie, but it did not shake the foundations of the genre enough for it to be something I can see myself having too many repeat viewings of.", "Absolutely perfect": "Release the SnyderVerse. This was absolutely incredible! Ben is the perfect Bruce Wayne ans Batman. With depth and perfect backstory a this film is amazing.", "Great movie for DC": "Will I have to say ,, this one is great and on the bar with Batman movies ( christian bale starring movies) .", "Good, nothing more, nothing less.": "The snyder cut really is a huge improvement compared to the theatrical version, but even in 4 long hours not everything is perfect, fans will always defend this movie and not accept negative comments, it is a movie which makes the 4 hours feel much longer because the pace is too slow, the story has a lot of errors and even plot holes, something that is really rare to see considering the duration.But even with that, I would really recommend this much more than the theatrical version.", "A Fantastic Experience": "After 4 years, a social media campaign and countless trailers we finally have Zack Snyder's Justice League in all of its 4 hour glory. It is crazy that a social media campaign really convinced Warner Bros to release this film and I am glad after his personal tragedy that Zack Snyder got the chance to make this film they way he wanted. I watched the film today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of people with remarkable abilities coming together in order to save the world from an ancient evil.Main Character\nI have always said that I really like Ben Affleck as Batman and I think he is great here. He is back to being a more serious character but you see more clearly here how the character has progressed since the events of Batman V Superman and Affleck does that well. He isn't given a real standout action scene but he is given a consistent amount of decent action and Affleck still has the physicality of Batman to make that seem realistic despite being the only member of the team without powers. Gal Gadot is back as Wonder Woman and I think anybody disappointed by Wonder Woman 1984 will be very happy to see her being a real star here. Gadot is a real glue that holds the heroes together and she does it really well and she really shines in the action scenes, she is the main one who shines in the action scenes and that is a real highlight.Supporting Characters\nIn the original version of Justice League, I thought Ray Fisher did a decent job as Victor Stone/Cyborg but he is so much better here and is easily the best character in the film. He is the real heart of the film and we learn so much more about Victor and the pain that he has and continues to go through in his new form. His role is larger and provides some real depth and delving into his personal life does a great job in telling his narrative. Ezra Miller is Barry Allen/The Flash and he is a fun member of the cast, he is clearly the comic relief of the film but he never becomes too much and unfunny, he has his serious moments but he works well as part of the group and is a nice addition. Jason Momoa is back as Aquaman and he is also a lot of fun here, we get a bit more of his backstory and it does work better here and make him feel like he has some development that links to his solo film. Henry Cavill is also back as Superman and he is okay, honestly he isn't in this film that much but he has some really standout moments and though he is less charming then he was in the theatrical cut he is still good here. The real surprise though is Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf. In the theatrical cut he was such a dull villain but here is a terrifying physical presence that has an interesting character arc and he was a great opposition for the Justice League here.Story\nThe overall story isn't too different to the theatrical cut but it is handled much better here. The characters are just given way more development time here and it does make you care about them and the way they develop as a group. The film has a much larger scale and for the most part it does work, it doesn't feel too shoehorned in and fits the overall feel of the film and what could have been the future of the DCEU.Script\nThe script is good, there is plenty of drama here and we see the characters go through some things that especially with the longer runtime makes you care. There is also humour sprinkled in here mainly from Miller, Momoa and Jeremy Irons as Alfred which does lighten the film at times when it very much needs it.Style\nThe one thing you can say about Zack Snyder is that he makes great looking films and this is another one of them. The action scenes are great and filmed really well to really encapsulate the epic nature of the characters and the film that we are seeing. Now the one major glaring issue is that this film is 4 hours long and it really shouldn't be, I appreciate the majority of the new content but there are clear parts of the film that could have been cut and it would have provided a better pacing, 3 hours is surely long enough, Avengers Endgame did it and I think this film could have done it.Overall\nOverall, this is a fantastic film and a Fantastic experience. This is a much improved version of Justice League and what it does is make me want to see more of Snyder's vision for the DCEU. 4 hours is a big commitment so I think only fans will do it but I would say give it a chance, it is a lot of fun.Rating - 9/10.", "Best DCEU Movie and One of the Most Epic Superhero Movies of the last years": "The current and convoluted DC Extended Universe has its BEST film in this masterpiece of escapism and excitement. Everyone is well developed, it brings real Justice to the Snyder arc and leaves the saga on a beautifully high note. Amazing, hard to top this one.", "This is the Justice League": "Call me a fanboy all you like but I'm in my honest to goodness opinion this may be the best superhero movie ever made, it's amazing what 4 hours can really set up and tell you about the story which gives this film the advantage, the characters are amazingly developed and true to their comic counterparts to be represented on screen, the story presented a great threat and had this big build up feel and in a personal comparison for me Darkseid was a WAY bigger threat, menacing, and intimidating than Marvels Thanos could delivered (albeit their motives and characteristics differ but this REALLY felt like a villain to be scared of rather than one to sympathise with and see their side for a 'greater good' ) exceptional visuals, tremendous effects, whether you're a Marvel or DC fan this is one to watch for the love of the comic book industry, it would be criminal to not let this continue #restorethesnyderverse", "The REAL justice league": "Yeah, just to echo what pretty much everyone is saying....this is what we expected!!

Getting into the backgrounds of the characters and how they came to be was amazing to watch. There was a long wait for superman but when he came he was absolutely worth the wait. All the main characters where played their parts extremely well. I could not find a single fault in the story. Showing the Flash travelling at light speed in slow motion was very well done. This has to be the best Blue Ray DVD I have ever bought. There is so much happening at the end of the movie when you think it's all over. They have left so much scope for a follow up.", "1": "On the plus side, the back stories are fun and the actors work hard to make this all come together, but at times this felt more like SUCKER PUNCH than WATCHMEN.", "\"For the children.\"": "R.I.P Autumn Snyder.\nYou are not alone..\n...", "Full Story is Here...Older Version had no Clue of Story Building and Direction": "I don't care 4+ hours movie if there is a story based journey and character building. Older version was literally a combination of rough cuts (still I liked because I love Batman). This movie felt me better than many Marvel Movies where they do not need Stories, Emotions, Acting etc.-1 for not having wide screen movie we are habitual to watch in. 4:3 is too older version which disturbed for 4 hours while watching movie. It was like WHY ruined experience of CGI, Wide Screen Reach? But even of that Movie was so good that it managed to get 9 out of 10 from me.", "The joint victory of the director and fans over the studio": "Everyone was waiting for Zack Snyder's movie in theaters back in 2017. How much time has passed since then and events have happened with this picture, I think any fan is aware. And now, when the very date of the premiere of Snyder's version loomed on the horizon, people were waiting more and more for the film. Including me.I would like to say that Zack Snyder's \"League of Justice\" is still not another movie that they tried to convey to us from \"any receiver\". I understand that this was done for advertising purposes, but still the general plot and message of the picture are identical in Zack's film and the theatrical stripped-down version of Whedan. There is the same conflict, the same plot development. But of course, the original vision of the creator of the picture Snyder is strikingly different from what was shown to us in 2017 in the cinema.Here, in this film, we can already see Zack's handwriting, recognize his visual style and crushing action. It is understandable. Now he had complete freedom in creativity. He was allowed to show the world of DC superheroes the way he wanted to show it. And it turned out quite well.I am sure it would be problematic to roll the film in cinemas because of its timing. After all, even ardent fans can't sit out 4 hours. Perhaps the decision to show a blockbuster on streaming services is the best solution. Everyone was able to watch the movie at their own pace and in a comfortable position. Hardly anyone could sit for all 4 hours and not pause. A good solution for breaks is to divide the film into chapters. It was quite possible to take a break.Snyder tried to reveal every character in the film, be it a villain or a hero. And he had enough time for this within the framework of a long blockbuster. Here we have time to feel the story of each character, because they are given enough time. We see the motivation of heroes and villains, we understand their emotional experiences, which are perfectly demonstrated through actions. The general tone of the picture makes it clear that the world has changed after the death of Superman, turning into gray cities that have lost hope. And at the same time, you involuntarily feel anxious. She is literally somewhere near you, creeping into your soul, because it is already known that a battle is coming, the enemy will attack soon, which will break an already fragile peace devoid of hope.The main antagonist is very different. Steppenwolf, which was introduced for the first time in \"Batman vs Superman\", in the theatrical version for some reason was changed to a guy with an ugly face and the same graphics. Here, the alien appears as a terrifying and deadly warrior from the very first frames. He is brutal, dangerous and does not cause laughter, like his version in the 2017 film. His first attack makes it clear that it will be much more difficult for the heroes to fight him. True, the film never reveals his problems in his relationship with Darkseid, but now we know that he really wants to return the favor of the lord, giving him the world of Earth. Well, the introduction of Darkseid, Desaad and Granny was so generally liked by all the fans. It's nice to realize that behind the Wolf, which is a dangerous enemy in itself, there are much more powerful forces and entire armadas. And at the moment when the Steppenwolf appears before Darkseid, the first one is perfectly shown. He grovels, he is no longer so brutal here, he is afraid and hopes for leniency. At some point, I even feel a little sorry for him.In the film, we will be shown the characters of all the members of the League and the inner circle. Yes. After watching the movie, each of the characters is perceived differently. Flash, although he remained the same buffoon, the character is worked much deeper. There is no feeling that he is a cardboard hero, that he is only meant to amuse the audience. Allen has his own arch, his own problems and heartaches, which necessarily give an opportunity to get into this guy.Also with a Cyborg. That's probably whose transformation is most noticeable in this film. I am not a fan of the character, but here he was shown in such a way that involuntarily your eyes fill with tears when you realize that a young guy has lost himself, found himself between life and death, a being who has no place in this world. He is no longer a man, like a ghost trying to find solace. And only within the team does he succeed.In relation to others, I have not noticed any dramatic changes. In the theatrical version, we saw about the same characters. Snyder, of course, supplemented their characters by showing the guys on the screen, both individually and in a team.With graphics, however, it turned out not everything is so perfect. But she's quite decent. There are no \"tear out the eye\" shots. Everything looks good, especially considering Snyder's visionary gift. The battle scenes are pretty cool. But sometimes thoughts slipped through: \"My. So it was Snyder who took it off, not Whedon.\" And these moments were a little upsetting. But not much.Snyder has well placed peculiar references to other films, thereby well showing the interconnectedness and integrity of the world of his expanded Universe. You see a Wonder Woman who has come a long way, stepping into the world of people a hundred years ago. Aquaman's communication with Mera and Vulko is intriguing, especially when Arthur Curry's solo album loomed ahead (at the time of 2017). In the cinema, we were introduced to other weighty characters, among which the Joker from Oscar-winning Jared Leto naturally became the coolest.The film is not without problems. Sometimes there are difficulties with dialogues that look quite banal and even silly. Something could be cut out of the film by shortening it. But we have the director's vision. It is quite worthy.\"Justice League\" by Zack Snyder is a good strong movie. In the abundance of events and characters, the director masterfully managed to keep the balance and prevent distortions. There are failures in some places when you realize that you are breaking out of the world of superheroes into reality because of an expressionless dialogue or the actions of the characters, there are ambiguous decisions of the heroes that look strange from the outside, but in general this is a good interesting movie made with love for the original sources. With this film, Zach makes it clear to all of us that he does not end his story in any way, because it continues and even exists. So far, however, only in the director's ideas. But who knows, maybe one day we will be able to see the whole story of the author as it was intended.8 out of 10.", "ZCJL is a must watch film for every DC fan!!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is the director's cut of the 2017 superhero film Justice League and the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe. This flm is direct sequel of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.The film stars and ensemble cast of Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Connie Nielsen, Diane Lane, J. K. Simmons and Willem Dafoe.ZSJL is truly a mesmerizing film and a true justice to the Justice league film, the film has everything a true DCEU fan has dreamed off. The film will satisfy you to the core by the way film is been narrated and is beautifully supported by the mind-blowing VFX. The length of the film is of 04 hours but no where looses the grip from the viewers. The action in the film is top class and cinematography is marvelous. The background music is also something to be appreciated for.Acting is superb and all the characters were superb in their respective roles. Screenplay of the film is daunting 04 hours long but never looses it's grip from the viewers. The climax of the film is good and gives a perfect closure.A must watch for all DC fans and a real treat for them.", "Eighty Million Dollar Vanity Project...": "So Warner's gave into the whiny little fanboys, who think Zack Snyder is the best thing since sliced bread. Here's the truth - he isn't. He's this generation's Michael Bay, another director who values style over substance. Like Bay, Snyder has limited scope and vision and this movie, a bloated, partly messy film, partially works and mostly doesn't. I'm in the minority because I liked the Theatrical version. At least it was shorter. At 4 plus hours this is way too long and needed two things right away: 1 - Editing. 2 - Way less slow motion. Snyder's overindulgence with slow motion is ridiculous and many parts of this look like a Music Video, which is where he got his start, so it makes sense that he's delved into his video roots. I'll break this down into the Good and the Bad.The Good - Fanboys got their movie. Now they can shut up. I've been reading comics for fifty years and one thing Zack Snyder doesn't have is any respect for the history of the characters. None. It's time for Warner's to reboot the entire DC universe, or just stop making movies. Marvel, after doing many horrible TV and never released movies, came out of the gate with a cohesive plan and it worked. DC, rather than doing things similarly, gave the reins to Snyder and he failed the task. He's made one great movie, 300. He's made two good movies; Watchmen and Man of Steel. And even MOS had major flaws. If it hadn't been for Chris Nolan's and David Goyer's input, MOS might have been as messy as Snyder's other DC films.Onto some more good - Superman. Cavil is great in the role. Snyder cut a great line from the Theatrical version, where he talks about believing in justice. But his beat down of Steppenwolf, as well as his beat down of the Justice League are the best parts in the entire movie.Wonder Woman. My favorite female superhero forever - she's handled well.Aquaman - Momoa does a good job as usual. Some complain that Aquaman isn't a blonde - I couldn't care less.Batman - I like Ben Affleck's Batman and I don't care who doesn't. He did a commendable job in a role that's way more comic oriented than my favorite Batman ever - Christian Bale. But Bale's Batman is situated in it's own pocket universe.The action scenes - when they aren't overly reliant on slow motion (which I really hate unless it's in small doses since it slows movies down) are decent.OK, onto the Bad.When AT&T purchased Warner's they also got DC and supposedly, a ton of debt. Throwing Eighty Million Dollars away on a vanity project that then premieres on HBOMax (thankfully I get this for free) isn't a way to crawl out from under that. So what was bad? A lot.Why wasn't this letterboxed? Are you kidding me? 80 million dollars and it's pan and scan? Please.The CGI - at times is decent, at others is entirely obvious. It looks less polished than some Playstation 5 games.No secret identities - Having Lois yell out CLARK! In front of fifty cops and soldiers - not a good idea. And having Lex know Bruce Wayne's and Clark Kent's secret identities? It was stupid in BVS Dawn of Justice and it's stupid now. Why was Superman in his black suit? This is just pandering to fanboys. If Superman is an icon of hope, he should be wearing his regular suit.The Epilogue - totally unnecessary. Just boring and disjointed. So now Batman isn't having dreams about Superman, he's having dreams about Cyborg going over to Darkseid's side?Darkseid, one of the greatest villains in DC history and the inspiration for Thanos, wasn't executed that well. I guess they didn't want him to be purple like Thanos (even though Thanos came second in comic history). And why throw in the Martian manhunter? What purpose does he serve other than be part of a sequel that will never happen? Why not throw in green lantern and green arrow as well?There was way too much posing and posturing. Adding that the overuse of slow motion... cutting all that would have sped up the movie and cut down the overlong running time. This isn't Lawrence of Arabia or The Lord of the Rings. It's a superhero movie and a less than epic one at that.Conclusion: Warner's needs to do several things to save their movie franchises.1 - Have the suits sign checks and stay out of the way. Their stupid suggestions ruined the Hobbit, and they're ruining the DC universe. People who don't know the background of what the movies are made about, shouldn't be involved.2 - Kick Snyder to the curb. He's got his less than stellar vision out (in his original script Lois Lane was going to die. What a stupid idea). He was given too much power and during his reign, Warner's put out three really good Superhero movies - Man of Steel (flawed but decent), Wonder Woman (the best of the three) and Aquaman. They also did one good movie without him, Birds of Prey. Dawn of Justice was OK, but it was way too soon to do the Dark Knight Returns and Doomsday. They should have done a Man of Steel sequel, a Flash movie and a new Green Lantern. THEN you do Justice League. So goodbye Snyder. Move on to what will likely be a terrible series of Zombie movies. I base this on his remake of Dawn of the Dead, which was filled with plot holes.3 - Bring in someone like the DC equivalent of Kevin Feige over at Marvel. While I personally haven't liked all the Marvel movies - none of them lost money and were box office titans. That's because, unlike DC, Marvel had a clear vision of what they were going to do. I'd suggest whoever does the DC animated films - Bruce Timm maybe? Be put in charge. He knows and loves the DC universe and would do it justice. Just watch Batman the Animated Series, Superman the Animated Series or Justice League.4 - Reboot the entire DC Universe. Keep Man of Steel, Both Wonder Womans, Aquaman and Birds of Prey. Round file the rest. Either that, or stick with animated movies and stop doing live action since whoever is in charge, doesn't know what they are doing.On a personal note; having seen both movies, i can't possibly believe that, in the short time available, Joss Whedon reshot 80 percent of this. Many scenes are exactly the same, only they look like they were tweaked digitally.", "better than batman vs superman": "Zack snyder very good direc this movie , warnes bros much make justice league 2.", "A great superhero film, superior to the theatrical version in almost every way": "The theatrical version of Justice League felt rushed, incomplete, and overall underwhelming, in my opinion. In only two hours, it tried to introduce the viewer to three heroes that had previously only had cameo appearances in the DCEU (Cyborg, The Flash, and Aquaman), a complex villain Steppenwolf, and three powerful Mother Boxes that could destroy the Earth. On top of that, the story it tried to tell was too long for that runtime.Snyder's four hour version of Justice League achieves all of this in a less sudden and more satisfying way. The characters are a lot more developed: we understand how each hero feels about joining the League and fighting, we understand why Steppenwolf is trying to collect the boxes and destroy Earth, and we understand why Batman and Wonder Woman are trying to unite the League in the first place. Cyborg in particular is much more interesting, and seeing his backstory not only helped make sense of the what the Mother Boxes could do (leading to the resurrection of Superman), but also made him one of the best characters in the film. Furthermore, the story develops at a more natural pace: the creation of the League, Steppenwolf's collection of the boxes, Superman's resurrection, and the fight against Steppenwolf all take up enough time for them not to feel trivial, as they did in the theatrical version.Zack Snyder's Justice League therefore gives the viewer a lot to be invested in: complex characters, an intriguing and complete story, and, ultimately, the cinematic universe as a whole. And it does so with impressive special effects, beautiful cinematography, and a great score. I would highly recommend this film to any fan of the superhero genre.", "Justice has finally been served": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a truly amazing movie that really gave Zack Snyder the redemption he deserved, this is one of the best DC movies ever made and it's easily the best DC movie since Joker, it is a one of a kind experience that I wish I could watch for the first time again.I'm glad Snyder got his creative freedom out there, because he did everything right and supremely improved from the piece of trash original, everybody's backstory was buffed including Aquaman's, and the 2 villains are some of the most menacing I've seen in a long time, with one of the most breathtaking finales ever, one of the most electrifying movie scenes I've ever seen in my life, some of the best music I've ever heard, and one of the most disturbing dream sequences I've ever seen.Ben Affleck and Ray Fisher are phenomenal in this film, I cared about every single character and there was rarely a moment I wasn't engaged.This is an electrifying and sometimes iconic movie that gives the Justice League the grounding they deserve, this is the best DCEU movie since Joker, and it absolutely deserves an A+", "He's never faught us not us United......": "Zack Snyder's Justice League. A fantastic movie and by far the superior version of the Justice League movie Zack Snyder makes the story better and adds more to these characters that we didn't see making for better experience and one hell of movie.The characters development in this one is outstanding and what is done with characters like Cyborg and The Flash is just amazing they are far better characters in this version of the film especially Cyborg who is definitely the heart of the film and has some of the best moments.The villain is handled so much better and the new design I love it his motive in this one makes more sense and he feels more like a threat in my opinion and Darkseid looks incredible.The action is incredible and has the Snyder style that I really like and works really well.I also loved seeing Martian Manhunter and the design was fantastic.Superman is alot better in this one I love when he shows up and fights Steppenwolf it was great when he says not impressed so much of a better entrance in this version and Henry Cavill is still perfect in this role.And I love seeing Ben Affleck as Batman he is great In the role and the Nightmare scene with him and Joker was perfect and my favourite part of the movie.My only issue with the film is I think they could of done more with the Black Suit and made it more like the regeneration suit from the comics and I don't think it makes sense that he still has it at the end he should of been back in his red and Blue colours in my opinion.But this film is awsome and definitely worth the wait with some fantastic scenes like Flash going back and saving everyone and beautifully shot scenes like Superman flying up to the sun this film is by far the superior version.The story is better and the villain is better handled and the characters are alot more developed which makes for a better movie.I do prefer Man of Steel as a film but this is one of the best from DC.Verdict 9.7/10 a fantastic movie with better character development and better story the villain is handled so much better this is by far the superior version some minor nitpicks but this is a fantastic movie and one of the best from DC.", "Now this is what I'm talking about DC!!!": "This movie was worth every minute of every second or every hour!! My God this was a fantastic movie and I can't wait to see Justice League 2!!!! Please WB don't screw this franchise up again!!! Let Synder run this franchise like Feige for Marvel!", "Truly An Epic Redemption": "This movie is epic in every way possible and an unbelievable improvement over the last film. The atmosphere and darkness of the film is captured perfectly. I cannot believe this was kept from us for so long. The 4 hours go by so fast because it's just so entertaining. And sure, there are a few unnecessary scenes here and there but did that didn't really slow down the pace, it was still entertaining as heck. Zack Snyder does a great job filming the action and capturing the heart, soul and motivations of all the characters. One of the best superhero movies made to date. The only real issues I had were at times the characters would tell you exactly what they are going to do, but that hardly detracts from the film. I most certainly recommend it.", "The justice, the league needed": "By far a different movie from what Joss gave us. It's honestly chalk and cheese.\nEntire scenes fleshed out and stories explored to complete the narrative. Part def show it's R rating with gore/fighting worth of that of the comics.\nLengthy yes but worth if you care to see the true story that was JL.\nWB should never have let Joss come in and give us a sub part, sub standard hero movie. Zack had the right direction from the beginning.\nThis cut is no End Game but fan service given on multiple fronts, from superman costumes to better characters development and even few \"new\" characters shown.\nCyborgs story arc was fleshed out and explored and given justice making him a true member of the league and not just an after thought.\nBarry had more screen time and less funny/stupid moments giving him more depth as a character.\nThe knightmare scene was great giving us solid interaction between two old foes. That makes me want to see a second movies explored such a future.\nIf this was green lite for a sequel you'd have a bigger league with great hero's.\nNo end credit scene but wasn't needed. The movie left me feeling satisfied.", "Masterful!": "Absolutely fabulous superhero flick! Outstanding entire cast, and fantastic cinematography and production! Love DC!", "A thrilling superhero team-up": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a fantastic revival of the director's dream for the DCEU. This version of the story is entertaining on every front, in both its characters and action. There are flaws still present, but every piece of the puzzle is so beautifully fleshed out compared to the abysmal 2017 movie. How the story progresses is exciting to watch, as well. The screenplay does a very good job to quickly introduce Aquaman, Cyborg, and Flash into the mix as the Justice League comes to fruition. Each character's backstory is given just enough depth that makes them relatable, while the story maintains a shared screen presence among the heroes. Importantly, the different personalities written for these roles all feel genuine and allow for every one to stand out not only with their powers, but also their motivations. Altogether, the story is wonderfully crafted for how much character depth it is willing to explore, and in turn how these subplots intertwine so coherently as the picture moves forward. As all good movies do, the story becomes more intriguing as it goes on, leading to an unbelievably awesome third act. Even so, the film is not without issue. The chaptering of the plot is practically negligible. What can be truly criticized, though, is that the film should be shorter. This does correlate to the Knightmare scenes that ultimately serve no real purpose to the story being told. Although, these scenes are interesting and well made, so everything almost evens itself out. The cameo of the seventh Justice League member is another idea that doesn't fit into what's happening. Otherwise, the long runtime is worthwhile. There are two main conveniences from the middle act that come to mind, as well. These moments play a key role in setting up the finale showdown. All considered, though, the plot never has to really cheat with where it goes because of its fantastic character development. Every motivation is clear, between each protagonist and villain. The dynamics between these various roles is a blast to watch, too, delivering much heart and comic relief. For the most part, the humor works. Emotionally, this film is extremely rich. This starts with Affleck's very good performance as a reformed, leadership-worthy Batman. His desire to fill the role Superman was to humanity feels real and picks up right after the previous events. His Bruce Wayne is less necessary to the plot, but those few scenes also feel natural. Gadot's act is just as good, as Wonder Woman delivers this wonderful aura of optimism and determination. There is just enough background to her origins that helps the audience relate to her even beyond her natural likability. Fisher is brilliant as Cyborg, aided by a great focus on his emotional journey. He delivers lines with such earnestness, whether it stem from disdain, respect, or realization. Momoa's Aquaman is a blast, too, from an intriguing disregard for his half-home of Atlantis to the serious, yet sometimes easygoing persona he emits. His performance nicely walks the line of this obviously complex role. Miller's Flash is a great addition, as he brings a cleverly written levity to the high stakes plot. There is a nice emotional resonance to the character, as well. In support, Irons' Alfred is very good for the few scenes he is in. The highlight is without question Morton's convincing act as Cyborg's father. Despite the initial set up, there is a certain likability to the role that is enhanced with how emotional the relationship with his son becomes. The antagonists are not extremely developed and have middling design, but prove very good nonetheless. Steppenwolf has largely clear motivations and even as a CGI creation, shows a decently emotional drive to his actions. Hinds' voices him well, giving a sense of realness to his dialogue. Darkseid's behind the scenes reasoning is intriguing, too. Together, these otherworldly creatures pose an immense threat and therefore present a great conflict for the heroes to overcome. Not to be forgotten, though, is Cavill's awesome inclusion inside the film as Superman. There is not much character building, but all of his scenes work astoundingly well. Among all the roles, the costume designs are fantastic and there is a great deal of meaningful dialogue, except for the few Amazonian lines that don't exactly feel genuine. What makes the film so phenomenal, though, is its action. Every action scene is exciting, and gets more so as the film progresses and more characters are in play. This leads to the amazingly outstanding third act battle. Every part of the fight comes together perfectly, from the CGI to the dialogue. The choreography is phenomenal as what happens is always clear to the viewer. With such a brilliant finale, the following resolution is able to be a great send off of the story. Every character is left in a beyond satisfactory place. On the technical side, there is a good sound and especially score throughout. The only remaining flaw of the film is an overuse of slow-motion. Ultimately, Zack Snyder's Justice League is an amazing watch, proving to be the true version of the film that everyone involved deserves to be recognized for.", "A masterpiece": "Beautiful, a master piece. This film is a slap in the face for WB and their interference. Watching this film and the scenes that were cut or edited terribly, it it honestly baffling how the 2017 justice league was allowed to happen.\nThe flow is so much better here, every character gets the treatment that they deserve.\nAlso the nightmare scene... who wouldn't want to see that film.\nLong live Battfleck.\n#restorethesnyderverse", "Big. Entertaining. Good action.": "Decent character development for the genre.Bad guys you've seen before, like Thanos from Avengers. Deep voice. Huge. \"I will crush this world!\"Although good animation, many of the action shots clearly look animated.Like conventional action movies, I'd make note of how various actors \"sold\" the conflicts. It's not really relevant in movies like these. A reasonably athletic actor could sell this kind of action, backed up by special effects.Odd they chose that aspect ratio bordering the right and left. Like a movie out of the '60s. Yes. I checked. Widescreen not available.", "Finally Justice get justice and I want more": "Ok, where do I start?The Nolan Batman trilogy laid down a big marker for the DC universe and I felt Man of Steel delivered an exciting start to a new generation of movies, but then what came next was a lot of noise and little substance.Every DC movie that followed failed to live up to the hype, with the franchise seemingly handing itself a Death Certificate.The Zack Snyder cut of The Justice League shows how the big bosses got things badly wrong when they dumped Snyder's vision in the trash can... where the cinematic release of The Justice League (and others) belong. I certainly haven't enjoyed Ben Affleck parading around as Bruce Wayne... until now.My only gripe with Zack's vision? 4:3 is a little bit too arty for me.His story connects the dots and gives the whole film substance that was previously missing. At times I felt I'd been transported back to the Nolan Batman movies with a methodical, look the characters, their lives, their struggles and their part in the bigger picture.The final 15 minutes also drew me in further and left me hungering for more. So please can we have a ZS sequel to this movie please?Is the film too long? Possibly. Some scenes could have been trimmed with their content and valuable contributions preserved, but it's a far superior movie to the mess that's the cinematic release.Final thoughts... what a shame this version (or a slightly shorter 16:9 version) didn't get released and Snyder given the green light to get the sequel off the ground.", "Stronger Together": "The Snyder Cut takes the time to develop the characters and story with an amount of subtle detail and sensitivity that makes Zack Snyder's Justice League nearly everything you would expect from a superhero movie.It also makes us wish for such brilliantly written, directed, and acted solo films for all the metahumans and aliens in the Justice League.I look forward to the second and third installments of the trilogy when they come out this decade. Then to finally be able to appreciate the work as a whole.The only reservation I have is about Ben Affleck, who is not a bad Bruce Wayne/Batman per se but does not embody his character like the other members of the Justice League.", "Amazing 9.5/10": "So after watching the Whedon cut, and being a long time DC Universe fan, i thought, \"this is the end\". When i heard rumblings of the redo coming, i was cautiously optimistic. I seen the 4 hr runtime and got a tad nervous, then i watched it, and i have to say, the time flew by. I hope this is a catalyst for more in the series. I would love to see where it goes. Thanks Zack Snyder you have risen the DC Universe from the ashes. RIP Autumn.", "Justice is Served": "Everyone was phenomenal in this film. Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher gave the best performance on this entire film. Their character was extremely likeable. Ray Fisher's Cyborg was definitely a huge improvement from the 2017's version. We also get to learn more about him and we got to watch his entire backstory too. Ezra Miller's Flash was phenomenal. Finally, we get to watch The Flash getting in some action and do things that are very important. He was one of the best character on this film.Steppenwolf was a fantastic villain. He was definitely menacing, scary and extremely brutal. His voice was so good and it sounded much deeper and better than the 2017's version. Also, his new design made him look more badass and evil. His suit design looked so good. The vfx team deserves an award just for the attention for the details on Steppenwolf.The pacing for this film was amazing. The editing was very well done. The visual effects looked incredible. The only part where the CGI looked bad was the knightmare sequence cause of the reshoots i guess. Other than that, the visuals was stunning. The cinematography was breathtaking. Every single shot on this film was extremely gorgeous. The soundtrack was extremelyngood especially Wonder Woman's theme. It was so good too hear and its definitely on the top 10 list of movie soundtracks. The storytelling for this film was really good and this is definitely an unique superhero film. I'm so glad that Zack Snyder gets to make this film and show his visions to us.", "This What I Called Almost Perfection": "After watching suprisingly almost felt like i watching new movie of Justice League all over again, First , i think 4 hour will feel too much to handle for watching single movie in same day, for real i'm not a fan of long movie, but yeah this one, prove me wrong, i can't believe craving it have more scene when it was nearly finished, and it doesn't matter how long movie was, if it's great, you can enjoyed without feeling bored and wanted going to toilet break, i feeling guilty i almost forget 2017 version of Justice League, 2017 Justice League good for flick popcorn movie that soon you'll forget after walking out from cinema with your family and friend, this one kinda slow paced, but make you feel connected with Hero Squad, something that i don't feel it in 2017 version, yeah maybe because this one give moment for backstory of our hero, Music Scoring was huge improvement beside story development, and one thing that make me awe for more was what a great atmospheric this movie can be, something that i can't describe with word, i really hope there will be sequel for this movie, standing applause for Zack Synder for giving fans something worthed to remember during this hard time of pandemic.", "The Zack Snyder Cut is way better, dark and intense than the 2017 version.": "It's just like watching Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman.

The simplest of lines of dialogue added to this edition, suddenly made the movie work. It was as though Whedon had wanted his version to be dumb and awkward, which was why I scored it lower than I would have it had made more sense. I actually didn't mind Whedon's version that much... sorry. But this is almost perfect now. I love Snyder's story telling and have been a fan for years, not understanding the hate he has always received. Ironic to me how much love he is now getting, but we'll deserved considering what he and his wife have been through.

Should have been packaged as two movies and then continued as a storyline after that (minus Jared Leto as the Joker who is a terrible fit).Allowing this masterpiece to come to light is the first thing DC has done right in a long time (besides 'Aquaman' which was good). Keep it going, get the suite away from the controls and let the artists work!!", "Well, It Is What it Is": "Never has there been a more desired director's cut before than Zack Snyder's Justice League. Meant as the DCEU's Avengers, Snyder initially had to step down from completing the film due to personal reasons, leaving Joss Whedon to complete it, only to completely change the movie from its original darker tone. After the film's polarizing reception and disastrous box office performance in 2017, DC fanboys begged and pleaded for the original version, only for it to finally commence last year and be released this month. After seeing the movie myself without having watched the theatrical cut, I can see why people have enjoyed this more.The film follows Wonder Woman forming the Justice League with Batman, Aquaman, Cyborg, the Flash, and Superman in order to save the world from the catastrophic threat of Darkseid, Steppenwolf and their army of Parademons. With a simple enough premise for a superhero movie, one might wonder why this cut is precisely 4 hours long, especially compared to the theatrical cut that only ran for two. However, given how much more characterization is in this movie compared to all the stuff left on the cutting room floor from beforehand, one could argue that it was necessary to go into why the superheroes get with each other in the first place. Admittedly, this film may not satisfy any detractor of the DCEU or Snyder's work, as it does have the usual padded out slow mo and overly showy gloomy cinematography. Then again, the movie spends less time on action than the set up of saving the world, with each superhero needing to get along in spite of their differences, so anyone viewing this should view this as a mini series, with the proper breaks in between.In addition to more substance, the film does at least have an identity of its own. One of the biggest problems people have shared with the theatrical cut is how tonally botched it is, having no clue whether it should be dark and brooding or bright and goofy. It doesn't help that the legend himself Danny Elfman had little material to work with in the end, whereas Tom Holkenborg's hauntingly epic and frightening score fits the more somber aesthetic Snyder intended here. Even most of the actors, besides Ezra Miller, do fit the more \"realistic\" tone in the movie. Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ray Fisher and Ciaran Hinds debatably take their roles the most seriously out of anyone else, as they bring the most sensible aspects to Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and Steppenwolf through their basic goals of good vs evil. Also, the visual effects feel a lot more convincing in this film than the rushed work in the theatrical cut (the less said about Superman's mustache, the better), and the blend of real actors and computer technology blend in so well that it was hard to tell if it was real or not.Am I saying the Snyder Cut is for everyone? Not by a long shot. The film is made for a very niche audience after all, mainly those who are big fans of DC, Snyder's filmography, or just superhero movie nerds, as it's hard to say if this would please anyone else. That being said, if you're interested in checking the film out on HBO Max, it's a decent enough 4 hour flick on its own. Besides, you can tell it was made with love when Snyder dedicated the film to his late daughter Autumn. If that's not pure passion and dedication to your craft, I don't know what else is.", "Added a missing peace": "Better then original. I somehow remembered that i watched original in the middle of this one. Great way of storytelling and back story of characters. It's entertaining from begging to the end. You will not notice that its 4 hours long. Hreat one for someone that didn't watch much of the dc movies.", "Superior": "A total work of art. The Synder version is so superior to the original in many ways. The only drawback is the length of the movie. It would have been better to cut it into two separate films.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version.": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)After years of outstanding effort from passionate fans, Warner Bros. finally decided to give Zack Snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms. 2017's Justice League went through massive production issues - explained in my review of said film - and despite years of extremely tiresome, toxic discourse on social media, the famous Snyder Cut got a controversy-inducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut. A crucial disclaimer: you'll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I'm part of the latter group of reviewers.I find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it's appropriate, but it's a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what's coming from a general perspective. Still, I'm reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it's not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.Without getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don't doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole \"it's a totally distinct movie\" or \"Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder's footage\" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn't need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017's version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder's Justice League better than its \"predecessor\".The most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher's character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the \"Us United\" storyline.The humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original's abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie's consistency.Story-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it's more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL's score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.There's only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don't belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It's by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn't heavily impact my opinion.A common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017's version, supposedly only Whedon's footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there's a couple of them that not only don't improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the \"bringing Superman back\" arc lacks an important character's take on the situation, having in mind that character's past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don't get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.Regarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it's really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can't get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.Zack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL's all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.Rating: B", "4hr of Awesomeness!": "Not even for a slight second it felt slow , it was entertaining and felt like what the original should be. The parts made it going, the familar but better story and scenes and the more fleshedout characters and the Darkside stuff it was awesome, The music was phenomenal and visuals were great compare to josstice's and the blood and gore with the action was awesome, the jokes although little but landed perfectly, The unique aspect ratio with the runtime it felt like a never seen before experience, Overall its a Great Movie!", "Worth the wait": "After seeing this masterpiece the old version is all but a faded memory far back in my brain, all the wait and all the hype for the release of this version has been worth waiting for, I would have even waited even longer so I can watch and a cinema! I hope that Zack takes it upon himself and continue the franchise and rebuild the DCEU for adults and make sure the movies keep the same quality as this one!!!!", "Long awaited Snyder Cut is longer but definitely better than the Justice League's theatrical cut.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) :\nMovie Review -It's been almost 4 years we all were fighting for Snyder Cut, and here it is finally. DC saw some box office bombs with Snyder and then issues with Justice League (2017) put them far behind Marvel Cinematic Universe at Box Office. Since, Snyder's exit DC had hits like Wonder Woman and Aquaman scoring good numbers at box office but the demand for Snyder Cut wasn't stopping for anything.Now, it is out and when you realise it's actually better than the theatrical version of 2017, you just can't bashing DC for doing such a big mistake. If that isn't enough then Snyder Cut leaves you at a point where you will ask for more of it. Come on, give us more and we mean it. On the comparative level, Snyder Cut is nothing extraordinary except for blasting features and teasing elements in the last one hour.We have seen Justice League in 2017 so there is no point in talking about the story and acting. So, let's move to the the special segments which makes this one better. Firstly, Snyder Cut is 4 hours long which is highly unexpected. But secondly, it uses the screentime for the sake of its own importance and good.In the first 3 hours there is nothing much that blows your mind, it is the same stuff from the Justice League with a few extended shots but then the last hour is totally astonishing in every way. It is more explosive, it is more accurate, it is more gripping and after the war is over it has several surprises to reveal which will leave you stunned. That Joker scene, Luthor's scene and the most surprising Manhunter.. oh my my it's too much load of happiness to handle.Zack Snyder had many things planned and he had a visionary line up in mind but unfortunately it didn't happen as it should have happened. May be these next versions of this Snyder Verse would have filled the oxygen in DC's lungs for long run. Hopefully, DC would give it a thought and someday we might get to experience this unique Snyder Verse because the teasing done by Snyder Cut can't have us waiting for long time. Overall, Snyder Cut comes for the betterment of Justice League's average standard and the fans get something to cheer finally. Watch it without any speculations and it is not gonna disappoint you.RATING - 6.5/10*", "$370 million dollars - the pinnacle of Hollywood's technological capacity right now. And as a non super hero fan, a pretty good movie too. It all makes sense at least.": "I haven't seen the 2017 version because I am not much of a super hero film fan as most of them I have seen are pretty rubbish (with notable exceptions, e.g. Joker). But due to the high ratings and the fact that this is a directors cut, so a second attempt at making a good film, I decided to give it a go. I was expecting to turn it off because of its 4 hour runtime. However, as super hero movies go this was good. It logically lays out the origins of the grand war and the characters within it, and then there is a big battle between good and evil. The special effects and action sequences it has to be said are out of this world. This film cost $370 million dollars, which is an unfathomable amount of money. But you certainly can tell. The characters were developed well and likeable and basically it just all made sense, which a lot of such films don't to non-super hero fanboys and thus are simply bad films.The main takeaway is that this is the pinnacle of Hollywood filmmaking and technological achievement. Thousands of people will have worked on this film from all round the globe with no expenses spared. It is interesting to see for this alone. It's like how people are interested in the world's greatest supercars because they are the pinnacle of automobile achievement. Even though if you had a chance to drive one it might not even find it that exciting.", "Better but not Great.": "Is it better? Yes.\nIs it good? Yes.\nIs it the greatest thing ever made? No.It's an improvement. The story actually feels complete and the whole movie has a certain flow that just works.However, there are still some scenes that could have been cut or remade. Obviously, In 4 hour movie you can always make the argument that some scenes could have been cut, so this little critique of mine doesn't carry much weight.The problem however isn't the edit, or the weird aspect ratio, Bad CGI and/or bad acting.\nThe biggest problem is still the script. The way all the characters are written just feels off. Aquaman is basically just an emo, Flash is just a kid, Commissioner Gordon is utterly useless. Alfred is all the suddenly a world leading mechanic and inventor? What happened to Lucius Fox?\nCyborg thinks he is a monster? Why? Because he's part machine? I can understand that he doesn't love or like it, But hating himself and hiding from the world? Why? It's so over-dramatic.\nAnd Batman preaching about faith and hope? What? Why?The biggest problem is still Wonder Woman.\nShe's written very clunky, The \"woke\" commentaries feels like nail on chalkboard. The stupidly skimpy outfit just feels outdated and unnecessary. If you're going to make her a feminist icon, At least get her some proper clothes. She's a 5000 year old trained soldier, leader of armies, genius-level scientist, carries the blood of the ancient goods, and you put her in a miniskirt? Is this the 1960's? Are women not allowed to leave the house without lipstick? At least give her some proper armour. Or pants.And this has always been a problem with Wonder Woman. Even in the animated movies and some of the comics. She is a hard character to write.\nBut they are not doing her any favors here either. Like why would she wear an evening gala dress to her work? Why the preachy, woke, tumbler commentaries in the middle of a rescue mission? Why have her walk up the stairs behind batman? She can literally fly.The second problem is Batman.\nBen Affleck is no Christian Bale. He is at best a b-grade actor. And having him pretty much carry this movie makes it a bumpy ride.\nAlso, since Wonder woman is on the team. (Again, a 5000 year old trained soldier, commander, princess and genius.) Why is the 40 year old shut-in orphan who've spent his entire life in the shadows the tactical leader?\nWhy do they need to go to the Batcave to use his 6 satellites, when Cyborg is directly connected to ever computer system in the world?\nWhy do they need the Batmobile to launch an attack on the tower if Cyborg can fire every single nuclear missile in the world at it by the blink of an eye. Heck! He doesn't even have to use nuclear, just hack into the nearest military complex and use whatever they have.\nBatman's superpower is that he is rich? Wonder woman has access to centuries of gold, Cyborg controls the worlds financial system, Aqua-man has inherit all the riches of the seven oceans. Flash can run so fast he manipulates time, Why does he need Bruce Wayne to give him a lift?Third Problem: Superman.\nHe is too overpowered. I mean, He is basically put on the same level as a God. And honestly, Superman is best when he is written as a man. Some of the best moments in the comics is when he shows compassion, heart and genuinely cares for people in need. Having him come in at the last moments of the movie, only to completely dominate just feels like a Deus Ex Machine. A Deus Ex Superman?", "I don't know why but I find this movie similar to the animated DC Universe.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is Phenomenal. It works very well on character development and sticking to the DC- Dark formula but still manages to make you laugh couple of times. I was surprised as well as impressed how well it's written and made in a way which shows similarities to DC Animated Universe (Which I love). Cyborg and Flash which were weakest part of Justice League 2017 are now the heart of Zack Snyder's Justice league. Aquaman and Superman don't get enough screenplay but help in keeping the movie pace forward. Batman and Wonder woman are good and their interactions with each other as well as other members of Justice league helps you continue the grip on the movie. As Mr. Fisher (Cyborg) mentioned, this 4 hour film is a feast and I couldn't agree more. Good luck for not keeping yourself attached with this movie, we probably aren't gonna get any sequels. 10/10 for me!", "Beautiful that this even exists": "A visual feast with that stylized Snyder beauty.

The character development is the focus & pays off wonderfully. The score emphasizes each emotion. The script is flawed but the cast perfectly fills their roles.", "The World's Greatest Super-Heroes": "The opening of the film is completely different with a recap of Superman's death and his Cry heard throughout the world. Along with the activation of the mother boxes. Batman travels to find Aquaman. You can tell already that the scene is drastically different with the conversation coming off as more fluent and not rushed. With Wonder Woman bank robbers you actually see them arrive at Bank take some hostages and have wonder woman show up. In the first 30 minutes of the film you can tell that you're getting a much different film. It does not come off as rushed and feels like it's actually building up. Which it does eventually happen. The first half overall builds up do the reveal of Steppenwolf. The theatrical cut of Steppenwolf came off as one of the most generic villains you can ever imagine on film he had no real motive pose no real threat his design was bland. His dialogue is rewriting drastically from the theatrical cut and it comes off as more barbaric and brutal as well his fighting style actually makes him seem a threat. Not obsessing over mother box he's on a quest trying to return home, to appease Darkseid. You find out more about Steppenwolf as well as Darkseid. The purpose of the mother boxes. It doesn't come off as a rush explanation the flashback battle with the Darkseid and his forces against the Amazons, Atlantan & man is much longer in shows off more. It's also recall you get to see Ares and Zeus and see green lanterns. However one of the biggest question being the box of man is just buried,It leaves you questioning why didn't they give the box to the Green Lantern Corps to protect it. Diana finds a ominous Mural of Darkseid telling the story. While not the forefront of the movie Darkseid knowing his overall presence builds to the tension of the eventuality of him arriving on earth and having to face him. Knowing that that he's going to be the greatest challenge when he arrives. This point you're getting introduced us both flash and cyborg each you're given time to actually know something about them. Cyborg was done the worst in the theatrical version. Here he's giving more time to flesh out and develop to get scene of him before the accident and get a idea of how him and his father's relationship. You also get a scene with Victor and his mother. You're giving more emotional and reason to care for Victor here and seeing why he's so important to the team. Barry has very fast-paced personality and that's appropriate given that the flash moves at a such a speed that everyone just seems very slow around him. However to his introduction into him being an iris it comes off as a little creepy where he's touching her face in slow motion. Aquaman's more serious you hear talks of his past involving his mother it's not discussed deeply . Arthur comes off as stern and serious character that doesn't really break his shell fully he does have a moment with Diana given the history their people and how similar the two of them might just be. Aquaman doesn't really have that big of a standout moment compared to the others. The factory fight is more intense it feels more appropriate for the justice league each one is given their own chance to shine. Batman has a purpose throughout the film he isn't just reduced to a joke role where he can't prove any use to the team he has a plan and he does bring the team together. He has the proper tools and he has the proper gadgets he does not hold back in this fight and he does not Feel like a burden he can hold his own amongst these parademons along with the rest of the league. A sidenote is that along with Bruce Alfred is there by his side helping him on standby at the back computer and has even Providing some gadgets. It a nice small that shows that Alfred is not just the butler who cleans the cave he's valuable to the Batman. However Batman does not have The same Intellect he has in the comics. He's the worlds greatest Detective and he does not have an answer to almost every event in the movie. Wonder woman is at the front most the most brutal of the team she shows no remorse and does not hold back at all being more true to her comic counterpart. Flash usefulness comes as a huge advantage with the whole freeze frame of him running alongside the walls. Especially in the final battle of the movie. What's missing from the theatrical cut is the league discussing the possibility of Superman's resurrection something that was drastically missing was the team actually talking to one another. It here but it makes you wish that they were a few more scenes like that in the movie building overall bond the team Represents. The film offers more of a explanation over how motherbox works and how they can Use it to their advantage and resurrected superman but the possibilities of these actions may have consequences later down the line. When it comes to superman his return he does not have that much screen time as everyone else. He shows up approximately around the three hour mark. There's possible hints to a evil superman. Part 6 is all about the final battle this feels just feels right each member is given the chance to show off what they can do what they have to offer from Aquaman to wonder woman and Batman to flash to cyborg and even superman arriving near the end this movie the final battle filled tons of action and the battle does not bother with random civilians or families that need rescue they put they put the entire focus on the boxes*Spoiler* The epilogue does drag on a bit too long you feel like it should end it with superman revealing his symbol, however the film continues With Lex Luthor escaping from Arkham Asylum and you see them on a yacht with his deathstroke and Hinting at Batman fighting deathstroke. Not only that after that we jump to an alternate reality quite possibly the future of what was hinted at in Batman versus superman you see earth desecrated by apokolips, what is possibility when Darkside finally arrives to earth with it with Batman leading a group of rebels including Deathstroke and joker You'll have to wonder what will lead to these outcomes not to mention Bruce is given a visit from the Martian manhunter who tells him that he's here to help and is offered a spot on the justice league. The Music is great however there were parts where you feel like there could be more variations. Wonder woman has a warrior chantThat plays over her the entire movie and you wish that they would play her theme by Rupert Greyson Williams would play more. It's only play in the opening during the bank scene. Man of steel theme by Hans Zimmer man plays almost every time Clark is on screen as well in the ship, at his farm it just comes off as overplayed a bit too much same with the flashes theme that plays every time he's running and you cut to slow motion.overall justice league is a great movie it has tons of action full of violence. The Snyder cut does not shy away from dismemberments and gore. Tons of dialogue to the story that helps build the world and set up how much bigger crisis down the line with the runtime of four hours it gives enough time to the characters more time to flesh out and not rushing to try To appease a general audience this movie was four hours because it needed to be four hours for It's story it's heroes it's villains.", "... not really better than JL2017": "First of all, the ratings are too emotional, this movie is not worth 10 star. Unfortunately we are familiar with DC movie assembled without logic (see suicide squad), the most important credit to this version is it gives logic to the succession of the movie events. Superman reawakening is not good, better JL2017 version. Final battle same, better JL2017 version.", "#Restorethesnyderverse": "With Zack's Signature style this movie with blow your mind away. Literally this is Most loved Superhero comic book movie undoubtedly.", "A bit painful...": "Took me a few tries to get through. Felt like I was watching the longest Transformers movie ever made. Too much action, too little heart.", "Four Hours of Agony": "I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of Zack Snyder's work in the DCEU. Both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman are horribly written, and I look forward to ripping apart those movies in the future. I have to say though, the hype surrounding this film piqued my interest. The highly positive reviews from fans and critics alike claimed that this film was not only an improvement over Josstice League (which, let's be real, isn't much to brag about), but also a masterpiece in its own right.So, the other day I gathered a large tub full of popcorn, and with four hours to spare I sat through all of Zack Snyder's Justice League. Even people who hate the DCEU have been singing its praises, so I was fairly optimistic. I was also curious about seeing what had been left out of the 2017 cut, and how much the two films would differ.Unfortunately, I found it to be a miserable experience. I walked away wondering why anyone enjoyed this film in the slightest. I also found it to be even worse than Josstice League. However, I want to make clear that I find this film worse because of the writing. After all, a story is the foundation that holds a film together, and the foundation for this film is completely broken.Before I watched this movie, I heard many people claim it was a completely different experience, and that they were shocked at how much had been removed from the theatrical version. This is an exaggeration. Yes, there are some characters that are different, and the ending has been changed, but for the most part this film has the same plot beats and characters as the first. To say it is an entirely different film is misleading.This movie is four hours long, but doesn't justify its runtime whatsoever. Aquaman, Superman and Wonder Woman are all essentially the same characters they were in Josstice. As for Batman, he learns to be more hopeful and faithful, which is something he already learnt by the end of BvS. Lois Lane is moping around for most of her screen time and is happy when Superman comes back, which is pretty much all we get from her. Steppenwolf has about 10% more development, but is still a far cry from what I would call a good character. Despite being twice as long, this film barely develops most of its cast.The whole experience feels like too little butter scraped over too much bread. There were so many scenes that kept dragging on for no reason and convey information in extremely inefficient ways. The scene where the Amazons shoot the arrow to warn Diana of the upcoming threat is a few seconds long in the Whedon Cut, and about five minutes in the Snyder Cut. Establishing shots go on for thirty seconds or more, and action scenes are extended by several minutes, even though they serve the same purpose to the plot.And the elements that are changed only worsen the film. There are a lot of characters that simply exist for fanservice and add nothing worthwhile to the overall experience. (Joker, Deathstroke, and Martian Manhunter). The film could've easily been cut down to two and a half hours, and the main story would be much the same. Apparently, Zack Snyder's never heard of \"less is more\". There's a reason why many scenes end up on the cutting room floor when editing movies.Cyborg is so powerful that he raises a million questions by simply existing. Why doesn't he just launch missiles on Steppenwolf's army? We've seen that conventional weapons can harm the para-demons. He also has full power over anything electronic, which makes you wonder why he can't even control his own arm when it goes into self-defense mode. The 2017 cut tried to rectify this by establishing that Cyborg has no control over his body, which explains at least some of these issues.Silas Stones marks the Mother-box with heat signatures, causing his own death. But why didn't he just provide the Justice League with the Mother-box? His sacrifice ensures that the League find the Mother-box, when instead he should have just given it to them when he had it. How does he even know Steppenwolf was coming for the box? Cyborg and his father get more characterization, but ultimately this harms the story more than it helps.Everyone also mentioned how fantastic Flash's character arc was is in this film and how much 'development' he gets compared to the Whedon Cut. In reality, his big pay-off moment consists of merely repeating a line from earlier on and doing something he can and would already have done at the beginning. Not exactly what I would call development. Yes, the scene looks gorgeous visually, and the soundtrack is excellent. But these are superficial elements. In reality, Flash's character doesn't grow any more than the one in JossticeConcerning his powers, Flash has the ability to reverse time, with no consequences nor limitations. This creates a huge issue that the film never addresses. Flash's powers make it so that stakes cannot exist in this universe ever again. He can basically prevent anything unfavorable from happening. Be glad that the Whedon cut removed the time travel scene, otherwise the DCEU would have trouble staying consistent moving forward.And if that wasn't too much already, Barry can also travel at the speed of light. This should allow him to defeat every villain he faces, as he could just slow down time and instantly defeat them. In the Whedon cut, it's quickly established that Flash is inexperienced, which somewhat explains why he doesn't use his powers as effectively as he could. In this cut, Flash is shown to be saving people from the start, so him not using his powers fully is more egregious here.The script is aware of this, which is why Flash is seen helping people walk stairs instead of stopping Steppenwolf during the tunnel fight, even though stopping him should be Barry's main priority. He can just freeze time as he wishes, so why doesn't he always do it when facing enemies? Either way, Flash's inclusion in this universe means there is no hope for logical consistency.Darkseid (like many things in this film) only exists for cheap fan-service. It baffles me that people think he is better than the villain in Josstice, when in reality they're both equally generic. He's just yet evil alien who wants to enslave worlds and terraform planets. In fact, in his first appearance (the flashback sequence) he gets mortally injured and barely escapes with the help of his followers. How intimidating. Remember Thanos' introduction, and how foreboding he was on screen? Even the Steppenwolf of the Whedon Cut was more impressive in his first appearance.To make matters worse, Darkseid forgets about Earth after leaving it. The one planet where he got defeated, left the mother-boxes, and found the Anti-Life equation; that's the planet whose name and location he forgot about. Zack Snyder himself confirmed this in a tweet, basically saying: \"Darkseid kind of forgot\". And it's not like we needed Darkseid in this movie at all. The story would've had one less plot hole and at least be shorter.The aspect ratio is unnecessary and takes away from the experience. The music is all over the place, ranging from terrible to decent. During the more dramatic moments, its solid, but Wonder Woman's score is appalling, and gave me an aneurysm every time it played. The color grading is at the lowest saturation imaginable. Oh, and that's not referring to the 'Justice is Grey' edition. And about twenty minutes of this movie is slow-motion. All in all, pretty standard Zack Snyder film-making.The epilogue sums up the entirety of the movie. More pointless fan service, extremely unsubtle dialogue, bad acting (Jared Leto's Joker still sucks) and more bait for future films. Once again, I am disappointed in a Zack Snyder film, and once again I remain baffled on why so many love his work. Please, if you don't want to waste four hours of your life, stay away from this film. The Whedon Cut was also terrible, but at least it wasn't four hours long. #DumpTheSnyderVerse.", "A MASTERPIECE OF SUPERHERO CINEMA!!": "A complete redemption of the 2017 Justice League that was finished by Joss Whedon, instead of Zack Snyder due to a family tragedy. I would take it as far as saying that this film may of saved the DCEU. The storyline was brilliant, and sets up for an amazing future if continued, the comedy was good, the acting superb, the characters had depth and you could easily emote with them. The action scenes were incredible, and beautifully shot. I absolutely love this film, this is DCEU version of Marvels: Avenger's, Infinity War, or Endgame. And yes, it is a four hour film, but comparably. Before Marvel's first Avenger movie, marvel produced five standalone superhero films with a total estimated 10 hours to introduces their hero's. DCEU/Zack Snyder had only three films, before they produced the Justice League. And after finally getting the true vision of the film, we see that Zack Snyder did in fact produce and give us a phenomenal film. I complete support a future of DC films guided under the vision of Zack Snyder's original plan.", "Now We Need the Sequel!": "First of all, this director's cut is obviously way better than the original movie in 2017. We got to see more of character development from each member of the Justice League. I can't believe so many beautiful and important scene being cut off to be released on theater. The story behind this is just make the movie better. Zack Snyder really knows what DC's fans want. But the movie has some cliffhanger that need to be explained. That's why we need the director continue the story. #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "THIS is more like it": "Let me start off my saying that this version is 1000 times better than the one that was released in theaters. Although the plot is the same, the specific interactions with each other are much different. It's as if they went back and completely reshot the whole movie with a completely new script. Everything is explained very clearly and is pretty easy to follow. Additionally, the music is much better, creates more suspense, and does a better job of engaging the audience.Yes, the movie is 4 hours long, and every minute of it is necessary. Think of it as more of a miniseries than an actual movie. It is broken up into six different parts. Each part can be thought of as the end of an episode, leading into the next one.The only thing that bothers me is the Joker scene at the end. Now I understand that, in this premonition, Lois has died (and apparently Batman could have stopped it if he were willing to sacrifice himself to save Lois), prompting Darkseid to seduce Superman into turning to the, well, dark side.But what I don't understand is why Bruce apparently needs the Joker. I realize that, in this scenario, times aren't normal, but the Joker isn't exactly a meta-human who could actually provide any significant help towards defeat Superman and Darkseid, right? I know that Zack Snyder really wanted to get Affleck's Batman and Leto's Joker on screen together. I just don't see how it fits the story.", "Damn": "The only terrible part is that Zack Snyder had to agree this story won't be allowed to continue in order to get it made. Would have loved to see this completely play out over a couple more films and maybe a few spin-offs.", "Way better then the first one": "This one is way better then the first one more action and we get more scenes with the flash cyborg and others normally it was just Batman and wonder woman.", "A movie which finally did Justice to the Justice League": "The road to get this movie was not an easy one but this movie easily makes up for those 3 years of pain.This movie immediately puts a greater focus on what was severely lacking in 'Josstice' League-The characters. The movie shows how each member of the team is burdened by his/her own responsibilities and past. Each hero has a different purpose and background, but their individual issues compel them to band together and form the team. Batman's character has been developed well and there's a clear difference from his antagonistic side, which was shown for the majority in BvS, and his return to his heroic side. Wonder Woman acts as a sort of a mediator who convinces members of the team and helps them stick together. She doesn't shy away from action either. Aquaman is the pessimist who has doubts with every plan yet doesn't refrain from supporting the team when it counts. Flash is humourous and expresses inexperience but ends up being one of the most useful and powerful members of the team and proves his worth. Superman's development is apparent as he doesn't harbour any uncertainties any longer and has fully understood his 'reason'. Cyborg, like Zack Snyder describes it, is certainly the \"heart of the movie\". We see his sad origin and his journey of acceptance, which is vital to the story as well. Unlike Josstice League, where every ounce of depth was thrown out for jokes and one-liners, the characters here feel real.The movie offers new antagonists such as Darkseid and Desaad with each one of them offering an interesting dynamic. They feel like actual threats and look really menacing. However, the primary antagonist, Steppenwolf is a huge improvement over whatever the version in the theatrical cut was supposed to be. Steppenwolf has an actual reason for his 'conquest' and the movie has brief mentions of his past and history which make you understand him as a character. He has a huge visual upgrade with one of the most interesting character designs ever.This movie even has far more effective humour than Josstice League since the jokes are well timed and not unnecessarily placed after every minute.The soundtrack is a huge improvement over the generic and forgettable music in the theatrical cut and doesn't sound out of place.The movie is visually stunning, with some of the best shots in CBM history. The CGI is great apart from a few moments of iffy CGI which is common for most CGI heavy films.The length of the movie may look troublesome but it's not. The first hour might seem a bit slow for some but I find it impossible to be bored throughout the rest of the movie since it has been paced very well. And of course, the movie has been conveniently divided into 7 parts for viewers who aren't comfortable with a 4-hour sitting.The performances range from good to great. Ray Fisher's performance is a standout. Apart from the main cast, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Peter Guinness and Ray Porter deserve praise for their respective characters as well.The movie's narrative is much more coherent and sensible. We can finally understand the story, though there is one slight flaw which could be fixed easily with further exposition if these movies ever get a sequel.The Knightmare Scene provided an insight into the future of the Snyder-Verse and also showed the first Batman and Joker interaction in live-action after 13 years. Ben Affleck's Batman and Jared Leto's Joker provided an interesting dynamic and the history between the characters could be felt. Oh, and Jared Leto's Joker has been improved as well.A few of my nitpicks and complaints are that Superman should've had more of an interaction with the League, the vocals in Wonder Woman's theme could've been toned down, fight scenes were slightly scaled down from the levels shown in MoS and BvS and the Knightmare Scene isn't as significant as the promotion would lead you to believe. But they seem insignificant when compared to the rest of the movie.The movie is tonally consistent as well and it does something that the DCEU severely lacks in its present state. It feels like it's a part of a cinematic universe unlike the recent DCEU movies which feel like one-offs and have no sense of direction. This movie expands on the DC lore and introduces new elements, opening the path to a whole range of new stories and sequels.It's a shame that WB threw this away for a travesty and is still adamant about not following this film's continuity. They're throwing away so much potential and so many stories that it's almost criminal. And no, it's hard trusting WB's plans for the DCEU since they've just stripped it of a vision and reduced it to a dead universe, in the 4 years since Snyder's departure.This movie's existence itself hurts a lot of egos and I wouldn't pay much heed to any negativity thrown towards it. Apart from IMDB's troll reviews, a review below literally says this movie is bad because Wonder Woman rescuing hostages from terrorists is not similar to Joker's heist in The Dark Knight. I mean are you even trying?Overall, this movie offers vindication for everyone involved in the making of it. It's one of the best CBMs ever made in my opinion. It reaffirms the importance of cinematography, tone, soundtrack and direction. It also shows that preferring 'jokes' over quality filmmaking, chasing mediocrity, not trusting and meddling with someone's idea can be disastrous. The movie has actual stakes, depth and feels well rounded.It also brings to light the mismanagement in the studio's conduct and hopefully sets an example that corporate meddling is the last thing a creative process needs.", "Zack Snyder is not a great director, just good.": "$300m to make a 4 hour ( if you like 2 movies in one ) final directors cut & let us be honest yes like many of us I'm a big super hero fan & yes I would have liked to see Justice League 2 & 3 ( which if both 4 hours too I guess would have really cost about $900m to make & actually been about 6 films in length if we say the average modern day Super hero movie is a generous 2 hours ).That all being said giving this movie 10 out of 10 would not be justice at all & yes I understand my fellow fan logic of saying it is better than it is, plus teach the suits ( producers ) a lesson & hope for parts 2 & 3 to be made in future. After all who likes to see a good story only told a third of the way & then cut.The truth is though Zack Snyder was not up the task as he is great at the choreography of action scenes however he is not good at ensuring the screen play script flows, keeps the suspension of disbelief & one liners work. This lack of directing ability is why the movie flopped & is 3 stars lower than any great director like James Gunn ( who has got better with age & experience ). This is actually something that makes me think yes I would like to see Zack Snyder direct a Justice league 2 & 3 as my hope would be he will have now learned from his mistakes of not concentrating enough of the story & actors dialogue, as nearly everyone gets wiser with age & improves in their jobs.So to Sum up I will list below the Pro's of Zack Snyder's Justice League;\nPro's: (1) The vast majority of the movie is action packed & these parts are as good as you would hope technically, though a bit better story telling & having the real possibility some of the super heroes being hurt/killed would be better.(2) Most of the actors do a superb job in the actual action & fight scenes in terms of their physical movements & facial expressions as you would expect.( Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa & Ray Fisher were 10 out of 10 in this movie )(3) The bad guys are done very well & you want to see them get justice.Con's (1) The linking parts of the movies that are extremely important to keep you invested, to help you care about the characters & suspend your disbelief are very average at best as some of the one liners just do not fit the movie.The fact is too many story driven moments do not really make logical sense.( lose 1 star for above )(2) Some of the choices for actors in the movies really hurt the movie as for $300m you should have every character played by the right type of actor & unfortunately Ben Affleck as the prime example just is not up to the task.Yes I understand he was already cast but with multiple Earths you can find a way to change actors if required, as the audience deserve better casting.( lose 1 star for poor casting, such as Jesse Eisenberg as another example )(3) I will not spoil the ending for people who have not seen this version of Justice League, however the last 30 minutes has things in it that just doesn't work & actually kinds of ruins the ending part of the movie that does work & has the hook in it to make Super Hero fans actually want 2 more films here.( lose 1 star for having a bad last 30 minutes that could put you to sleep )", "Just one thing": "Just one thingRestore the snyderverseRestore the snyderverseRestore the snyderverse.", "What was that?!": "Let me start by saying that I don't like superhero movies a lot but I'm subscribed to five streaming services and they have those movies, so why not.One of the service I have gives points that you need to use before they expire so you can see movies that are not free.We had to use points so my wife proposed to watch this movie ...I saw the other version already and it was one of the worse superhero movies, in my already low scale...Well, this version here was very very good! I'm thinking it may have become my favorite superhero movie now!I'm the first to be surprised because as I said, I hated the other version, and I usually don't like any of the DC heroes...\nI don't like Superman, Batman, Wonder woman and Aquaman. The only one I kind of liked before was flash.But in this movie, I liked all of them, even the non superpowered Batman!", "Infinitely Better Than the Whedon Version": "I don't particularly like Zack Snyder's vision of the DCU, with Superman being watchable and Batman vs Superman being a horrible movie, but hat's off to him for this movie.I wasn't expecting much going into this movie, but it was a darker movie with most of the comic elements having been cut out, and just about everything was more satisfying and enjoyable and the Flash especially was written much better.I have only 2 complaints.\nOne is the runtime. 4 hours is a bit much and I found quite a bit of material that could have been cut. My amateur eye caught about an hour's worth that could have been cut with no negative impact on the film.The second complaint is the aspect ratio. 4:3, really?\nI don't understand the thought process behind this at all. Most of us have fairly large televisions these days, and 4:3 is jarring when viewed on a large screen.Despite my few complaints, I can recommend this movie wholeheartedly.", "Lots of Superheros in one 4-hour movie.": "I enjoyed this movie. It is a bit long so I watched it in three sittings and considering how much the story covered it probably needed four hours. It is of course filled with computer generated characters and special effects but that is not what I like best. For me the quieter scenes where characters actually conversed were the best.I have been enjoying various versions of Supercharacters since I was a kid, in the early 1960s. I enjoy the fantasy, the chance to escape real life for a while. This movie checked all the boxes.I watched it at home on a DVD set (2 discs) from my public library. Curiously they chose to issue it in 4:3 screen ratio instead of the more common 16:9 or other wide screen ratio. The discs only have the movie, no extras. My wife skipped, not her type of movie.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a wonderful movie": "An interesting and unique story. The Snyder version delivers full storylines and character development. Its worlds better than the 2017 version. I really enjoyed this movie. My only complain is that its to long and could have been cut to like 3-3,5 hours.", "Perfect": "Perfect movie. Better than all the Marvel movies combined!", "interesting, overlong, unnecessary": "A lot of people hated 2017's Justice League, a movie started by Zack Snyder then taken over and revamped by Joss Whedon. And many of these people were desperate to see Snyder's original vision, and clamored so loudly that it actually happened.I was not clamoring for this movie. First off, I'm one of the few people who enjoyed the 2017 movie, Second, Snyder had just come off of the execrable Batman vs. Superman so I wasn't that optimistic that his vision would be better than Whedon's.Justice League is, for me, a considerable step up from BvS but a step down from the 2017 version, mainly because it's overlong with many sluggish sections.Snyder has a unique approach to superheroes. Instead of showing them as people with extraordinary powers, he sees them as modern gods. His Justice League is like some Ray Harryhausen movie about Zeus. Only he takes this all much more seriously than your typical Zeus movie, and some of JL is hugely pretentious. And because Snyder feels he's making this big, important, Wagnerian drama, he will drag scenes out because he's enamored by the mood he thinks he's creating.At the same time, the guy really knows his way around an action scene. Wonder Woman taking on terrorists early on is phenomenal. The Flash saving a woman from a car crash is exciting and funny. The final huge battle is long and intense.None of this excuses the 4-hour length. Fully an hour of this movie could be trimmed out by removing pregnant pauses and scenes that just drag on too long. The best moments are as good as anything in Snyder's Man of Steel, but there are too many places where I was rolling my eyes and wishing Snyder was a little less in love with Snyder's vision.Ultimately, I liked this movie, though not as much as I liked the 2017 version. But I probably would have liked both the same if this were an hour shorter. The story's interesting, Snyder's approach to superheroes is unique, the visuals are striking, the performances are excellent, and the special effects are solid. And that weird coda in the desert really does sell the sequels Snyder will probably never get to make.It's worth watching, although I watched it in chunks and think I would rate it lower if forced to watch the whole thing at once.", "More of the same Zack Snyder garbage": "I have hated everything that Zack Snyder has done with movies based on DC comics (and virtually everything else he has done.) Yet, I didn't feel it would be fair for me to criticize his vision of Justice League without seeing it for myself. So I sat for way too long and watched his monstrosity from start to finish. To say this thing is problematic would be a massive understatement. I'll try not to spend 4 more hours of your time nitpicking it to death, so instead I'll hit the big highlights that made it a bad viewing experience for me:1) Visuals - I simply couldn't see many scenes of this movie. Zack Snyder's style demands so much darkening of the color palette that I was losing key moments in the overwhelming amount of shadows. He also loves to tint everything with a more bluish tone, so we don't get many vibrant colors, which lends a depressingly somber feel to the entire thing. I actually tried adjusting up the brightness on my TV and shifting the color more into the red to make it watchable, but that didn't seem effective at counteracting what Snyder had done.2) Pacing - Any time you allow a director to have free rein there is a risk that they will make a movie that is bloated, but never is that more obvious than here. There are countless scenes in this film that a good editor would have left on the cutting room floor. At times this movie is like watching a DVD that puts all the deleted scenes into their original place in the film, that's how pointless some of these scenes felt. There simply wasn't enough story to warrant 4 hours. Not only are their superfluous scenes, but many of them are dragged out in an agonizing fashion where I kept waiting for someone to yell \"cut.\" Even some of the action sequences go on for so long that I was getting bored with them.3) Moments - Part of that tedious pacing is because of Zack Snyder's obsession with awe-inspiring \"moments.\" If you haven't watched the Youtube video by Nerdwriter1 about Moments vs. Scenes, it's required viewing to understand my point here. Snyder is a slave to his desire to show memorable single frames of film, which means more slow motion than you've ever seen in your life. I swear, if you ran all the scenes that are slow motion in this film at regular speed, you'd probably lose an hour off the runtime. It's so bad that we get a scene where The Flash is supposed to be moving in the blink of an eye, and yet we still see his own actions in slow motion. It's not enough to slow the world down around him, but he too must move like a turtle.4) Spoilers - *Don't read this point if you don't want the new things this cut of the film adds spoiled for you.* Lots of superhero movies like to tease what might come next. It's a tried-and-true piece of this kind of episodic storytelling which works like a cliffhanger, getting the audience excited for what may come next, but Zack Snyder is terrible at this aspect of comic book film-making. For starters, Batman isn't a psychic that can foresee the future, so why do we keep getting these moronic post-apocalyptic dream sequences from his perspective? Particularly when they star characters he's never even met yet! But even worse was the early Martian Manhunter appearance. That one moment caused 2 major problems: It undermined the emotion of the scene we had just watched between Lois Lane and Martha Kent, and it makes Martian Manhunter look like an uncaring loser because it establishes that he is around on Earth but he won't come to the aid of the Justice League when they are fighting to save the world.5) Inhumanity - When you watch a movie like Watchmen or a show like The Boys there's an obvious inhumanity among the characters because they have these god-like powers that they feel place them above average people. But typically we have come to know superHEROES like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman as protectors of mankind. They feel it is their duty to fight for those who can't fight for themselves. In fact, many of them live by a code (in the comics) to remain non-lethal at all costs. But in this movie they are killers. They kill the bad guys, and aside from a couple minor scenes early on, we never see them saving a human life directly. In fact, Snyder pulls the same crap he used in BvS where the climax is conveniently in an abandoned city, so they don't have to worry about destroying everything and killing countless civilians. Making comic book characters compassionate, makes them inspiring. You want to be like that hero, and you find them relatable, because they care about people like you. Zack Snyder's heroes don't seem to feel that way.Perhaps the most damning thing I can say about Zack Snyder's Justice League is that I preferred the theatrical cut of the movie. Yes, that movie is terribly problematic and has plotting that makes no sense. However, it had a tone that made the movie somewhat fun. I wasn't depressed after watching it. And considering this is what Joss Whedon had to work with, that's a pretty impressive feat. That's not even mentioning the elephant in the room, the fact that it told a similar story in half the time. I'd never say that either version of Justice League is a good movie, though, and I'll be happy never to watch any of this again. My journey with DC movies is probably done at this point, until they find a new vision that makes them enjoyable.", "Made me love DC again": "This movie proves that longer movies can work you know and understand every character. When the movie finishes you don't feel like something was left unfinished. I can't wait for the next one!", "Didn't like the first movie, this one is a masterpiece!": "As much as I did not like the first making of Justice League, this one is so powerful and full of beauty (yes, beauty).There are some scenes that kept us holding our breath, like suspended in the moment.I don't know how to explain, needs to be experienced.I wish they will release a theatrical version of it, this deserves to be on the big big screen!", "An amended movie righted all the wrongs of if predecessor": "I didn't hate the first Justice League, but it seemed to try to combine the dark tones of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies with the action of Marvel which lacked the ability to hold my attention like Nolan or Marvel. Now that I understand that the director of the 2017 movie was first with the avengers, that total made sense as to why the first JL felt that way. I had always thought Marvel was superior to DC until the Snyder cut. This was very long, but the time was needed to built the character arcs that were significantly lacking in the 2017 version. I remember leaving the 2017 film with a strong dislike for Cyborg and the Flash. Cyborg had felt like a wasted character, just put in place to fill a stereotyped quota, get tossed aside each time he attempted to fight and yelling random things like \"booyah\" made him intolerable. The flash came off as whinny, wimpy and feminine. After the Snyder cut, I now love these two characters and they made the movie. I can now understand why Ray F and Jason M were so annoyed with the 2017 version knowing that this gem existed. I hope Snyder is in charge of all DC movies going forward. Also looking forward to Cyborg and Flash individual film...but only if Snyder does it.", "Better than terrible still doesn't mean good": "While this is certainly a trade up on the dumpster fire that was the original release it still is chalked full of its own problems.

Don't waste your time on this crap, watch the original. As far as I am concerned Snyder is on my list of directors who should never be allowed to make another movie along with M Night Shallowman, JJ Abrams, and Michael Bay.", "The world has gone mad. This is not a good movie.": "I'm just going to be brief and blunt here. I don't like dark superhero movies. I find them uncharismatic. And with Snyder's movies, there's the added disadvantages of the story and characters just not having much depth. Flashy production values make this look like an early 90s Image comic: great artwork, horribly shoddy writing.There are poignant moments in Zack Snyder's Justice League. Elements of the story certainly are better than the hatchet job that was the 2017 Whedon movie. But this new one is far, far, far too long, with endless dull set-up that doesn't add much of anything to the story. There is no interesting dialogue, nothing that makes us interested in the characters and their backstories (except for Victor Stone, a little bit - but ironically his story was more compelling in the Whedon version!), and Steppenwolf and Darkseid are totally one-note. Instead of using actual STORIES from the comics, Snyder here is only really using CONCEPTS from the comics, and that doesn't come close to cutting it.Then there's the ending, which clearly sets up the \"story\" from the Injustice computer game (that I haven't played; I find it abominable), where Superman goes crazy and starts killing the world. The one thing that Superman should absolutely never do. I hope this sequel does NOT get made.I rate this movie 5 stars out of 10 - same as I rated the Whedon version. Some elements are better, others are worse; the overriding thing is that the running time is far too long, and the plot is far too simplistic and uninteresting. With this kind of running time, we should have had time to get really deeply into all the characters. Well, as long as Snyder is on the job, THAT is definitely not happening. Oh, DC. Why do they always have to do things wrong. Dark, gritty and wrong. Somebody stop them.", "I wish I could've seen this epic movie without the 2017 aberration": "I just think the impact would've been insane. Because everything Whedon did was spoil the movie, make everything worse, from characterization to action (how you ruin an already 100% action sequence with awful editing?). I guess I understand ruining the story to make it shorter.Anyways, this is Lord of the Rings level epic, at that level, only for a few things that still bothered me in this version: Flash and a Tolkien-like simplistic story.Flash's arc and action sequences were awesome, but I still don't feel Ezra's choices and the white humor written by Terrio and Snyder showed how much of a weakness that is for them.About the story, coming from the intimacy and passion of Man of Steel and the depth and quality of the BvS script, this one felt too shallow. Like a standard \"team up to defeat absolute evil\" normal comic-book movie, which wasn't the case with the previous ones.", "Thats it!!": "Much better than the 2017 thing.

I've liked some of what he's done (Dawn of the Dead and especially Watchmen were pretty great), but I've been consistently baffled, underwhelmed and confused by his DC superhero work. Man of Steel was a mess, but it had some creativity and fantastic shots; Batman v Superman was just a mess; and Justice League 2017... I mean, fans and non-fans agree that this was an unmitigated disaster. So when I heard rumors of a \"Snyder Cut\", I thought: \"why\"? We've already seen how Snyder handles these properties; a recut won't help this one bit. But the fans were adamant, and here it is....And it's exactly what I thought it would be. This FOUR-HOUR film plugs in the gaps of the 2017 release with filler - some of it entertaining, none of it necessary - and probably 50 full minutes of super slow-motion. All of the CGI is as bad as it looks in the trailers. There is no reason whatsoever for this to be four hours long. The plot is mostly identical, so you won't be surprised by much, and I was so supremely bored at times that I had to fast-forward. A key reason for this is the action. All of the fight scenes in this movie are shockingly, embarrassingly uncreative. It devolves into shooty shooty, hitty hitty for hours on end, even though you've got unique characters with highly distinct powers. None of this is used. The most bizarre example of this is a Green Lantern (who has the power to conjure anything he dreams of) shooting... a green beam of light. Oh, and in this same flashback, Darkseid gets defeated in about five minutes by... an axe. I mean, how on earth is this dude a threat? Oh, and the epilogue is so grimdark and emo that I was laughing out loud. Go home, Joker. You're drunk.Anyway, I personally got nothing out of this; I'm sure some fans did.

One looses their credibility when they start referring to one of the characters as a \"dork\" which just spotlights their immaturity.This movie has SO much more depth and coherency and illustrates the characters with far more grace and relevance, evoking more genuine emotion because of the story telling that is allowed to occur.Having seen both visions for this movie it's glaringly apparent where this was eviscerated in the cutting room and spliced back together with the cartoonish nonsense that was the final theatrical release from Joss Whedon.What a travesty! Shame on the WB executives for doing what they did to this.Barry Allan and Victor Stone are now no longer extraneous plot devices, but vital three dimensional people with heart and purpose.The pettiness and bickering between the three leads is gone thank God! It didn't belong there and in the wake of Superman's death was inappropriate and unnecessary - particularly between Bruce and Diana.The two most cringe inducing lines from the theatrical cut were thankfully absent because they truly detracted from the film in a lame attempt to inject some \"vintage campiness\" into the franchise that was trying to step away from animation and into relevance.(For clarification I'm referring to two moments: Martha Kent telling Lois about losing the farm with the banks that \"Jump like a cougar if you miss by a dime.\"; and Superman's grand entrance to the final fight scene with \"I'm a pretty big fan of justice.\")Antiquated scripting that was completely out of place in a modern setting that derailed the original release irreparably.Stepenwolf becomes a MUCH more intimidating antagonist and the motives for his actions are so much clearer with the arc of DeSaad and Darkseid shedding light on his origins.This version very nicely sets up Arthur Curry's backstory in preparation for his standalone film in Aquaman without any \"spoiler alerts\" because having him show up out of the blue (pun not intended) suddenly with his armor and trident under Gotham Harbor left a lot of unanswered questions when Aquaman was released and we discovered that there was much more contention than we knew.The micro-interaction in Atlantis in the theatrical release didn't account for how he had armor in Justice League but not in Aquaman? This version lets us in on that without giving anything important away.And finally the premonitions of the Dark Superman that we glimpsed in BvsS when Bruce dreams of Barry coming to warn him to save Lois are masterfully tied together with the epilogue of this release!I won't give anything away here - you need to see it for yourself!THIS is the movie that SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED the first time around!", "Zack is legend #restoresnyderverse": "Zack is best this is what I want movie. Thank you #restoresnyderverse", "THIS is a super-hero movie": "Everyone else take note - this is how you do it.Now, go and do likewise.So, this has to be 150 characters so I'll just waste some space here to say that it's all been said. Just wanted to add my $.02 to help prod the powers-that-be that this is what audiences want.", "Longer hours, more stories to tell, more character developments, more action, an improvement in general": "And I forgot to mention about less cheesy jokes, though there are still some, especially the ones consistently thrown by the Flash, I know Zack was pressured by the studio to lighten the tone down, it's just doesn't work with me, the Joker still cringey somehow, and as usual, Zack's still being too over dramatic with slow-mos and background music which sometimes work in one scene sometimes don't that I secretly find really hilarious about him. Too be honest, I'm one of so many few people who don't find the theatrical cut really that bad, I mean the jokes, the CGI, the villain design, they're okay to me. But I remember giving it 7/10 because the story is not well developed. But now we have a 4 hour version of what could have been back in 2017, I might say I'm quiet satisfied and impressed, especially by the action scenes that I feel kinda short and should be able to open people's eyes on how seriously should these characters be taken. All in all, I give it 7.5 or 8 out of 10 for the mind and hard work Zack had put into this, and since I also take other people's opinion and acceptance toward this movie, I'm just gonna raise the score to 8.5/10. I know it's just a wishful thinking, but I really, really hope Snyder will be given the chance to finish his vision. Just scrap that Superman-Batman-Lois Lane love triangle idea completely, change the story from what have been revealed to us a bit, and we're good.", "Epic": "State of the Art. Epic. BEST SUPERHEROES MOVIE EVER", "Extra, not enough": "Extra good visual eye candy and long enough to have some character development, but ultimately same cheesy jokes, same simply good vs bad story and lots of fighting that lead to the feel good moment ending. Entertaining more so than most super hero movies (way too many) but nothing original.", "This is the way a good superhero film should be made!": "Good balance between story, details and superhero action.All the extra character and story details is a good balance to the action. The action also had a lot of details and the slow-motion parts in the action sequences ads lots of quality drama to it. It allows a quick break from the fast action sequences and ads even more drama to that scene.The different background music also fits good for each scene and superhero. This is the way I wish to see more superhero films. Lots of drama, lots of detail and the humour is also highbrow and not endless silly one-liners as in other superhero movies.Please make more such long detailed superhero films. More from Zack Snyder please!", "I Like this JL Version": "I think i like this JL version than the other version. I understand the story and i like how Zack Snider presenting this movie without rushing the time. Four hours.... But i dont bore with this movie.But I wonder why.... The Flash costume is still so funny. Like the last version. It's look cheapy, and made from cardboard?", "Definitely Better but Too Long": "With a runtime of over 4 hours, this one can spend more time in the cutting room. It is too long and there are obvious slacks that should be eliminated to make the story flow better and tighter. That said, this is definitely a step-up from the version that got cinematic release earlier. However, compared to any Marvel movies of the past decade, this still feels second grade. Somehow the story feels weaker, less engaging and less coherent, even with 3 of the most widely loved Superheros in history: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman... A tail was left at the very end of the movie, a sequel is possible, and if they decide to make one, they should start with the basics: A strong screenplay.", "Mindblowing": "Zack Snyder justice league is masterpiece\nPart 2 make Fast", "Quite long": "It seems a bit of a mess as a film, its one part music video montage, one part large battle scenes and one part scenes of very awkward exposition.While its four hours long the film itself ends after three and a half and then you have some random scenes which I guess were supposed to go in the end credits ala Marvel.I do think the scenes with Batman and Alfred are good and are the best part of the whole film. The rest of it however is just all a bit messy with so much awkward jumping from one thing to another. The director really seems to want to make music videos more than films a lot of the time. It was okay but not massively different from the other version, don't really see the point and it wasn't realy worth waching again for me.", "Better if you like pretentiousness": "There are two metrics relevant to ZSJL. First is the JWJL of 2017, the other is, of course, The Avengers Saga.The JWJL Movie attempted to use the Flash's Nebbish Neurosis and Aguaman's slacker angst as comic relief. Whedon obviously used these two devices to try to match the light-hearted humor that is seamlessly integrated throughout the Marvel Universe. In terms of box office, you can assume that Studio Bigwigs wanted to see this kind of movie...laden with flashy action sequences and one liners by stars. But the problem is that the Avengers was a stew of many parts slowly developed over a series of movies. You knew who Thor was. You knew Ironman was a quipster. You knew the GOTG was based upon sly puns and buddy humor. Those jokes came naturally. But...when the Flash is doing a George Costanza routine...it was a little off putting.And then there is the multiple movie Universe Spanning arc of the Avengers. Little did we know that the Red Skull in Captain America had an Infinity Stone, or that Loki did. This decade long series of hints and easter eggs slowly developed into the Galactic Space Opera Infinity Wars/End Game. We were ready for it. In Whedon's movie, Steppinwolf and the unity of the boxes, just did not have the Gravitas needed to compel us.Snyder's four hour multi-chapter movie tries to correct some of these mistakes.The Aquaman Movie took care of that character. The Flash movie is coming, so they didn't do much to explain him, they simply toned down the Woodie Allen act and played him a little straighter. Cyborg, for me, is maybe one of the best comic characters. There is a poignant tragedy behind the character, and Ray Fisher is way underrated in how well he brings pathos to that character. I personally would have loved to have seen a separate origin film for Cyborg. I personally like Affleck as Batman in the sense he looks like Batman. But the personal dynamics of Dawn of Justice viciousness between two supposedly intelligent good guys never really worked, and neither does their new found alliance. At their core...they both seem like dicks. Gal Godot brings an exotic aspect to Wonder Woman that works in all the movies so far.So what do we wind up with. Certainly a better told, slower paced, slow brew story that sheds humor and becomes completely earnest and somewhat dark. We get some strange out of left field components that are related to the expansion of the DC Cinematic Universe, the Multiverse scenario that both Marvel and DC are moving towards, and a possible extension of some future story involving these Justice League Characters, Jared Leto's Batman, The Martian Manhunter and a run amok Superman.Maybe this take goes too far in shedding the light-hearted humor of a Summer Action movie. Maybe the big fight climax is not that much different or better than the first version. It still falls short of the Marvel plot and pace. It still would have been improved if origin movies of the other characters had been done first. Batman and Superman still come across as stiffs. All in all, we are not humming as smoothly as Marvel has done.", "Fantastic": "This Called A Master Peace, Form Zack Snyder Sir, Power Packed.\nThis version of justice league defines who ZACK SYNDER is.", "Just What I Expected": "Warning, this movie is not the same movie released before. This is a totally different one. The story is better, the tone is darker, the dialogues and action are way better. If I have to complaint maybe some CGI that still feels off. But not as bad as removing Cavill moustache CGI.It is 4 hours long, but you'll stay to watch this. It is fascinating. They added more backstory to the superheroes. We have better Flash, Cyborg, and Batman. Seriously, in the 2017 release Batman is weak. But this time he deserves to be called superhero, even though his superpower is being rich, lol. He fight better, and he's capable to lead other stronger super being.But like I said before some CGI aren't as good as it supposed to be. So I only rate this 8, if not this is an easy 9 movie.Finally Zack Snyder gives justice to the Justice League.", "The way to make a movie 4hrs of fantastic entertainment \ud83d\udc4c": "Just sit back an enjoy a fantastic experience..no spoilers.", "A pile of bull": "If you are a fan of superheroes galore or mindless series, this is good combination of both, but don't expect the depth in any character - what you see is what you get, and you get very little, just kicks, a massive let down for fans expecting better scripts. Especially you like the Nolan's Batmans, this feels like good toothbrush commercials script. I believe Covid has given us all too many hours with our screens, so we can waste 4hrs!! On this pile of bull. Not sure who paid to make it, but I can't understand why people would pay to see it. My strong advice is against it.PS. I wonder how a spoiler of this movie would look like... all characters on the poster, make a league, and put out the bad guys. A three minute trailer would have saved me from this junk.", "Uneven but good overall": "It's not a masterpiece, nor is it hot garbage. It's entertaining, if a little long winded at times.Cyborg should have had his own origin movie rather than wedging his story into an ensemble piece like this. His backstory and the Clark/Lois rekindled romance really drag the pacing down at points. Also Cyborg deserved having better motion capture, being one of the stars. So much of his movement looked like it was done used hobbiest level IK rigging. Steppenwolf did look much better this time around.I really hope they make a movie that includes more of that dark alternate future from Batman's nightmare. Jared Leto's Joker is getting much better.", "Imperfect, yet still renders the 'Whedon cut' absolutely obsolete.": "Though 'Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021)' is fundamentally the same film as its 2017 counterpart, the differences between the two cannot be understated. Although the thing runs two hours longer, it isn't the extra footage that has the most impact, it's the tone. Almost entirely through editing, the picture creates a much more cohesive, compelling and appropriate tone with which to tell its narrative and, as such, is actually a much more engaging affair. It's also much more interesting, assuming an identity of its own that doesn't feel diluted in any way shape or form. Of course, a four-hour superhero film directed by Zack Snyder is practically guaranteed to have some problems. Most of these issues stem from the fact that the film feels like an assembly cut, especially in its first half. It tries to do so much that it ultimately feels rather aimless for a large chunk of its run-time. I mean, not only is it concerned with bringing its eponymous team together, it's also a (now retroactive) introduction to three of the team's members. Plus, it makes a point of setting up several future films - mostly during an epilogue that sees the picture cruise past its natural stopping point two or three times, ultimately ending on a rather sour note that tries one's patience - that are now not even on DC's upcoming slate. It's so cramped that, despite its hefty length, it can't quite do everything it wants to - or, at least, it can't do it as well as it wants to. There's a distinct lack of character - Superman, for example, is barely anything other than a tool for the third-act action - and sometimes it seems as though it expects you to be familiar with the comics to fully understand what's happening. The frustrating thing about it is that it could have been really good if it were edited down a bit, even if it was still relatively long (like two-and-a-half or even three hours), and if it wasn't quite as ambitious. Still, it's certainly the definitive version of the story; it renders the so-called 'Whedon cut' absolutely obsolete. You can feel its length, but it's never boring. Though it's sometimes misjudged and, even, a little cringe-worthy, it's just as often exciting and well-executed. It's a mixed bag, but it's ultimately worth a watch whether or not you've seen the original (at least to someone interested in the source material). 6/10.", "Best DC movie ever!!!": "Say less,this movie is everything dc's fans want EVERYTHING this movie so epic so fantastic ,love this movie!!! Thank Zack from Thailand", "The masterpiece that DC needed.": "All I can say is, what an epic film! Forget the 2017 version and consider this as the main film for DC. Absolutely brilliant! We need a sequel to this with the same actors.", "Redemeption has arrived": "This will be a very short review for now... Mainly as its been qute some time since I saw the orginal cut and need to go back and watch it again to make a fair comparrison.But, There can be NO DENIAL... THIS IS THE DEFINTIVE JUSTICE LEAUGE!Zack Snyder has some annoyances, I wil say that... There are some things he will always do that mark him out and you always know you are watching a Zack Snyder Movie when you see them... Lens Flare, Dark Shadows, Overuse of Slow Motion...Yeah, Slo Motion is OVERUSED... There are points where The Flash is running where everything is Slow Motion where Barry Allen would have been better seen in NORMAL SPEED to truly reflect how teh world for him LITERALLY SLOWS... Not him! Minor asthetic thing but yeah... When you see it... You never get it out of your head!Already the Internet is ABUZZ with how this movie FIXES the issues many had with Jared Leto's JOKER from Suicde Squad (I still maintain that even putting Joker in Suicide Squad was a DUMB IDEA! It was a SUICIDE SQUAD MOVIE, But Warner Brothers wanted to throw in the best selling characters for MONEY - And banked on making it a JOKER MOVIE! Warner Bros... STOP DOING THIS!!!!)While it is a very short appearence, YES... IT DOES PROVE THAT JARED LETO CAN AND WILL BE A BRILLIANT JOKER! Now does WB have the Balls to make that happen?Another character redeemed by the Snyder Cut - JESSIE EISENBERG'S LEX LUTHOR! I am being SERIOUS... Eisenberg has proven he CAN pull this off... Once more a very short scene... BUT THIS IS THE LUTHOR WE WANTED AND NEEDED!!! NOT whatever that was we saw before!!!Cyborg gets more time to shine... Something that Joss Wheedon failed to do... But there are sacrifices made to make thsi happen!WAIT! WHAT!? I AM DARING TO CRITICISE THE SNYDER CUT? BLASPHEMY!Yeah... I dare! I truly Dare....In return for Cyborg getting the much needed character development he sorely needed, Barry Allen actually loses some!A Scene from the original cut has the Flash stressing to Batman how he is not a warrior... How he is afraid... How he lacks confidence against his peers... And batman simply asks him to rescue people... \"Save Just One\" in turn helping build Barry as he becomes more confident as he succeeds.THIS IS MISSING IN THE SNYDER CUT... Allen has little doubt in his ability making him slightly blander than the original, Not enough to really harm the movie but it is again a noticable difference!The Darker Tone and havng a great many unnecessary Jokes removed WORKJS BRILLIANTLY in the movies favour - It is NOT devoid of Humour... And that which is there is PERFECTLY EXECTUTED!4 Hours is DAMN LONG... But there was not a single moment I did not enjoy!I will say however, If you took BOTH VERSIONS, and took the best points of each... Bring back the Flash / Batman speech Especially... PERFECTION!While Joss Wheedon at this time is a bit of a \"Problem\" - A Colaboration between him and Snyder could create Miracles! Let us hope that Wheedon can address his past and become a better person so that may one day happen. (You have to have some faith that people can change... Otherwise whats the point?)There can be no argument - The Snyder Cut is the BEST VERSION... BEYOND DOUBT!Warner Brothers, HAVE SOME DAMN FAITH IN YOUR CREATIVE TEAMS FOR LORDS SAKE!", "THIS Is \"The Perfect Justice League Movie?\" ... really?": "I have seen so many reviews call this film \"The Perfect Justice League Movie.\" As a DC fan, I am appalled by this, and extremely frustrated. Because we deserve better.What comic storyline did Snyder adapt for his \"Perfect Justice League Movie\"? Did he adapt the Tower of Babel storyline? Identity Crisis? The Death of Superman? Did he send the Justice League to WWII to fight Vandal Savage? Did he at the very least write an interesting original plot??Nope. CGI monster man is trying to get three cubes. That's it. That's the plot of the \"Perfect Justice League Movie.\"And now let's look at the cast of this masterpiece: an insufferably boring, mentally checked-out Ben Affleck as Batman; ever-brooding Henry Cavill as Superman ('cause that's what that character is known for, right? Brooding, constantly?); personality-less Amy Adams as Lois Lane; Gal Gadot, as wooden as ever, as Wonder Woman; Jason \"I'm Sooooo Edgy\" Momoa as Captain Fish; and Ray Fisher and Ezra Miller - two actually good actors playing abysmally underdeveloped characters - as Cyborg and the Flash. This is it. This the best talent Warner Bros can buy.Oh, and don't forget Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor! I mean, when I think of Superman's arch-nemesis, the words that come to mind are definitely \"nerdy\" and \"erratic\" and \"whiny,\" not, ya know, formidable. Or terrifying. Or charismatic.Also, this movie is 4-hours long and has NO editing. Seriously, scenes just \"happen\" after other scenes end for no rhyme or reason. You could take any of the pointless Lois Lane scenes and move them literally anywhere else in this film, it would change nothing. The movie has no flow, no forward momentum, no stakes at all. There's no tension. Who cares if CGI monster man gives the cubes to the bigger CGI monster man? Not one character is likable. Who cares if they die?This is not the \"Perfect Justice League Movie.\" Is it better than the Whedon version? I mean, maybe? They're both abysmally mediocre. The Whedon one is shorter, at least?As DC fans, we need to demand better films. It is a serious problem if the Justice League animated series is a million times more nuanced and well-written that both live-action Justice League films.", "Restore the Snyder Verse": "Thank you .This is the justice league we deserve.Barry's speed force scenes are so epic.", "Great job, watched it all in one sitting": "So good. If anything wished it could have developed the Martian and the last scene which needed more development.I really wish they can continue with one more movie", "This is the Justice League we deserved": "I just finished watching it it's a master piece, fantastic, amazing and brilliant.\nWe got to see more of Victor Stone, aka Cyborg, which we hardly saw in the Josstice league.\nAquaman wasn't all over Wonder Woman in this film, which felt out of place in the other JL, it was focused more on battle and worked much better.Ignore what the movie critics may say, just watch the film for yourself.I loved that there were moments explained so you weren't left confused about what's happening and why it's gonna happen. That was another thing missing from the previous JL.Overall, it's a film that's worth seeing, it's funny when it wants to be and doesn't feel out of place, it's heart-breaking in others and very enjoyable.", "Just what DC Fans wanted!!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League review :First things first; the Snyder Cut released on HBO Max worldwide and the new Book My Show Stream platform in India is not an extended or full version of 2017's Justice League which though credited to Zack Snyder was not really his vision as he left the project incomplete to battle a personal trajedy. This four hours long film appears completely new in itself and is a significant improvement to the original theatrical flop.Having said that, it is an exhausting watch in one go and I would've preferred it in an episodic format series which was Snyder's original intention. The plot essentially remains same as the 2017 Justice League. What gets added in Snyder Cut is the all important character development and backstories of key characters like Flash and Cyborg. Something which was missing previously which made that film inconsistent.Another significant improvement are the CGI effects for which Warner Bros reportedly spent an additional 70 million dollars. Wish they had done it last time itself. Still, better late than never!! The film takes its own sweet time to climax but the last hour conflict is truly fantabulous.To sum up, Zack Snyder's JL is a treat for all DC fans. It is a film they wished for and thankfully, have got it. In all its splendour and glory!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.", "What a great new take": "Wow! This film felt epic. Let's get the two main cons out of the way first: the film slogs a teeny bit in some places and some of the CGI still looks wonky. Outside of that, we have a film that focuses on heart instead of quips and guffaws. It also centers the story solidly on the \"team\" instead of just the two titular heroes from Batman V Superman.There are so many minute changes, additions, tonal shifts that add up to a more solid, cohesive film. Whedon basically took an axe to the original and turned it into a near-campy mess. Snyder's brooding, troubled, heartfelt idea of what a superhero film should be.Some other pros: gone is the sexualization of Wonder Woman, which the original Wonder Woman film tried so hard to dismantle. Whedon basically made a juvenile attempt to pander her to horny teen guys in his cut. Also back is the fantastic backstory and life of Cyborg, which in the Whedon cut was basically, \"Eh, here's a dude who's Robocop.\" Whedon also tried to keep Cyborg's cartoon catch phrase \"Booyah!\" which has absolutely no place in this movie. And finally, all members of the team ultimately earn respect through their actions, something that Whedon seemed to avoid in lieu of saying, \"They're super heroes! Of *course* they're good guys.\" There are many more sub-surface demons the heroes fight in the Snyder cut.In short: Whedon wanted to sell toys through cheesy one-liners; Snyder wanted to make an epic.", "This movie is freaking great": "I'm not a Snyder fans or Snyder Hater, just a simply movie watcher. When I watched this in HBO GO with a low expectations (I never put high expectations in movie after the sequel of Star Wars and Whedon's Justice League). But wow! Just WOW!! This story is way greater than I expected! The story is way better than MoS and BvS UE! They actually did a teamwork instead of depend on Superman! Ezra and Ray are way more natural in the movie instead of being stiff like in the theater version not to mention this movie the character way freshing and more interesting especially Cyborg. Not to mention there are no CGI mouth on Henry!!! The Knightmare dream also a blast when that person mention about a certain character!", "Zack Snyder delivers.": "I don't know why they didn't go with this script in the first place. This was pretty awesome. Flawed but still, awesome. Soundtrack deserves a standing ovation. It was terrific. I wished they used the score from Wonder Woman though. The one used in this was good but the other suits better.\nLoved how they wrote scenes for Batman. Loved WW and Superman. Flash was little annoying and trying too hard to be funny. But he has one epic scene. Aquaman has some good scenes but wasn't much good. Steppenwolf was so much better in this.\nCould've avoided some scenes in the movie. But still, it's really good.", "Such an improvement!": "Way better than the previously released film. I have watched it 4 times already.", "Much better, still not great though": "At least this movie now makes sense. However, my main gripes are that its too long, too serious and looks too dark.\nIt has more fake endings than Return of the King.\nI do not need to see Aquaman walk into the sea in slow motion ever again.\nLike most DC movies, it's a bit meh.", "An improvement on Justice League but defo not a 10": "So I think people are getting carried away with their ratings.Is it better than Justice League? Yes. Is it a masterpiece? No. Best DC film ever made? Nope.So take the 10 ratings with a pinch of salt and it's mostly fan boys highlighting that the Snyder Cut is the better film and they're pushing for it to be canon.Storyline is better, and the CGI has definitely been upgraded. They did overdo it a bit with Wonderwoman's theme but on the whole the soundtrack was decent.Joker epilogue was just awful, absolutely no point in filming that. Guess Zack just wanted the joker in the movie.Eisenberg is a terrible Luther, thankfully he's only in it for literally 2 minutes but that scene cut have done with being cut.Not that it's Snyder's fault but as with the original, this movie suffers in that it's an alliance film without all the characters have standalone movies beforehand.Which it really what has helped Marvel run away with the MCU.Hopefully after the DC standalone movies all come out Justice League 2 will be able to compete with the Avengers.", "4 hours of awesomeness...brilliant": "Best film of 2021 and the best thing was I got to watch it for free on Sky. It's on par with Avengers Infinity War which is saying something. It's not perfect but I really didn't want the film to ever end. This time round everyone has a good share of screen time. The epilogue of the film is the best I've ever seen in any film, and sets up nicely for future Justice League films. Please deliver us more Justice League films Mr Snyder.", "Much more complete, but too many open ends..": "This definetely feels like the story makes sense, why the heores ara heores and why the villains are villains..However this just consolidates all the possiblities now and in the future and just throw to us.

With Zac Synders Justice League it fills the story out a lot more, it's a superior film in many ways. The storyline was more engaging with a better backstory for The Flash and Cyborg. It is overly long and at best they could've done without the epilogue saving about 25mins and they could have cut some time by trimming or deleted some scenes altogether saving another 15 mins. However, this film worked as it is and my criticism is just nitpicking. It's a well made movie and a big step up from it's original.", "Four hours long?..okay, so I watched it twice//": "Now, this is how it should've been..not complaining though, I've already forgotten that 2017 version; it even restored my adoration of WM, she snatched it off my thoughts with that '84 crap - positively, and without a doubt, a must watch//", "A vast improvement - I enjoyed it more than most of the marvel ones": "It is a really good superhero film.Fantastic effects and great camera work.Brought out each character and yes indeed - wanting more from this universe.Which after the original was certainly not the case.", "Truly inspiring!!": "What I most like about Zack is, he is very good at showing the superhumans inner self. And he nicely convince the fans that they are also human and but also they are noble. For sure the movie is filled with hidden stuff and powerful messages and once you addicted to his work, you will never recover. This is exactly how the superhero movies should be and mainly like in justice league, superhero movies should be capable of inspiring people, and through that people will also follow their heros and try to push the limits and rise against injustice as their heroes do. Finally this is not just a movie. It is an essential thing to build a strong human with powerful mind.", "Excellent": "Damn it WB you fked up. The ZSJL is a brilliant movie. The 4 hours went just like that. The Cast and their screen presence gave me literal chills. The History lesson is awesome (Want a solo Darkseid or New God's movie ASAP). The Action sequences, Storyline especially the CGI all were way better than Josstice league. But the MM CGI was little bit weird. Anyway the movie is awesome and surely gave orgasm for fans. Now I want ZSJL-2&3. #RestoreSnyderVerse", "Actually good": "This movie provides one of the most over-cinematic scenes a superhero movie can do. The villains are well presented and give the audience the feel of actually being intimidated, not sure if it's because of their evil entrances or well performed voice. If that intimidation was kept for the whole movie, then it could be been a thrilling experience. Unfortunately their threat seems to be deteriorated in the later part of the movie.The style of the cinematic shots and soundtrack of our heroes can be described as overdone, I think they tried to go for the Watchmen route (because of the overdone cinematic scenes of superheroes posing it felt like watching an advertisement for alcohol drinks). Almost every character has a dark origin which gives DC the unique \"edgy\" feeling. I think that extends the superhero genre and can also be a nice contrast to the Marvel movies.The battle scenes are simply epic. Each character has a proper role in it, not like the last time where some characters were there only for the presence. Lois's and Martha's story length, on the other hand, was too long for its purpose, they wanted us to miss Superman but his return was not enough to justify the dreadful story of Lois and Martha. Other characters fit in their cliche superhero roles well.", "DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS": "If you truly are a fan and a member of the comic book/ superhero community. This movie will mean a lot to you . I understand the 4 hour run time annoyed some people but I think it was needed to really tell the full story. This movie was truly a masterpiece. The only negatives I have on this film are a few nit picky things that blow by me pretty easily. The use of slo mo could have been dialed down just a notch and maybe just the slow beginning. Other than that. It's in my top 5 superhero movies as of right now. I recommend it to anyone who's a true fan.", "The greatest Superhero movie of them all !": "No spoilers. This is simply a masterpiece,and ,at nearly 4hrs long,I was still disappointed when it finished. It is a mystery to me why Ben Affleck doesn't get more respect for his Batman/ Bruce Wayne. I'm a massive fan of the Dark Knight trilogy, but it would've been even better with Affleck.", "How did Joss Wheden screw this up so badly?!": "This movie is great, I cannot believe that Wheden screwed it up so badly, it had so much potential, I only wish we could watch it without knowing what's gonna happen, but even so, it's a great movie and feels completely different.", "Long? yes.....Totally worth it.": "This was totally worth the fight to get made. The Whedon cut was a joke. This was a much better movie and did justice to this film and the comics.It is amazing on how close this film stayed to the comic too. Kudos to Snyder and his ability to keep the story as close as possible to the comics. I dont understand why they had to re-invent the wheel.These books/stories from the comics are already fantastic and already drawn out, laid out in cells and ready for the director to throw up on a storyboard for his team to create for a movie.There should not really be a need to change anything. Maybe a need to add something here and there to make more \"Hollywood\", but not really a necessity to remove it. It all connects in the books.Once again.... Kudos to Snyder. I would have rather paid to see this in theaters than the other heap of trash.", "Dark, Mean and well moody...Brilliant!!": "Just watch it. I did it over four 1hr episodes. Like a mini series. That way you can take in all that is being offered to you, and there's a lot to absorb.", "Surprisingly still mediocre": "This is a fascinating project. I say that with no hesitation. It's almost a masterclass on how a Hollywood movie is made, especially if you compare it to the previous version. It's fascinating to see all the decisions made to try and improve the movie and to see the frustration of a director who slowly sees it's creation being taken away from him. But let's start at the beginning, it's a very good place to start. I really didn't like Josstice League, it was a mess of a movie and I hated almost everything about it, with very few redeeming features. And, as everyone else, I was really surprised that Warner went along with a Zack Snyder cut to try and fix that Frankenstein of a movie, but most of all I was very skeptical that there would be a good version of this movie anywhere. Many of the things I hated about Josstice League were more conceptual than anything else, like the production design, as everything was so ugly, including the costumes, the script, especially Steppenwolf which was just a very generic and uninspired villain, the chemistry between our heroes was completely off and the whole concept of creating the Justice League seemed as if it was missing some steps (like, say, stand alone movies to introduce our heroes like some other company might have done), the sfx were very badly done, but the thing that surprised me the most was the direction, as I thought it was the ugliest movie Snyder had ever directed. This may sound like a nitpick or a raving from a nerd but bear with me, I hated the aspect ratio of Josstice League and I couldn't understand why a man that had always shot 2.35 : 1 suddenly had a 1.85 : 1 movie. It was the exact same problem I had with the first Avengers movie and I wondered if Joss Whedon had anything to do with it. Just to explain a bit more I think that epic movies, like these movies are supposed to be, need a 2.35 : 1 aspect ratio, it gives them more room to breath and work much better aesthetically. That's one of the things I hate with the IMAX format, because it only works on IMAX theatres and at home it just seems weird, and don't get me started on Nolan's obsession with that format where he switches aspect ratios mid films, it's the only thing that I can't agree with his filmmaking process. Anyway, as you can see my problems were deeper than the story or the editing, they were conceptual, and if filming a random Russian family didn't help, the Whedon reshots didn't seem to be my main problem. So, fast forward a few years and this version comes out, and everyone seems to agree that this is a masterpiece, it even gets into IMDB's top 250 (which I suspect won't last long), and the reviews are through the roof and everyone seems happy. And I wonder if the world has gone insane... So, with some hesitation I go through it, even watching Josstice League the day before to get it fresher in my memory, and lo and behold, surprisingly it still has the same problems I hated about the original. Who knew that if you add two hours of crap to crap, it's still crap... I must say it starts off really well, as I loved the opening shots with the scream of Superman, and it has a lot of things that undoubtedly work better in this version, but is it even fair to compare both versions? I mean, Snyder had three additional years to hear all the complaints and try to tweak them, while Whedon had only a bunch of studio heads to work with, not to mention the liberty to do a four hour movie, something that could never happen with a theatrical release (and Snyder knew it for sure), so obviously this is an upgraded version that addresses some of the problems of the original. But almost all of my issues are still there, an ugly production design, bad chemistry, lack of stand alone movies, bad cgi, and an even worse aspect ratio. Snyder is a talented visual director, and I usually like his movies very much, and there are some hints of that visual flair in these movies (I really like two shots in particular, both very similar, the one where Barry Allen catches the batarang in slo mo, and the one where Superman looks sideways to the Flash when he's running, both these shots display all the things I love about Snyder as a director), but besides some of those shots this is still, for me, an ugly movie. The biggest upgrade they made that worked for me was the fleshing out of Steppenwolf as he's a somewhat more interesting villain, but not that much more. But, dare I say, some of the changes that Whedon had done were actually for the better! I really liked the line where Batman says to the Flash to try and save just one person, that would be enough, I also liked the fact that it was Batman that brought Lois to stop evil Superman, those are just a few examples of stuff they actually did better, not to mention the pacing that has a lot of issues in this version, with some of the additional scenes being understandably cut, like the Flash car crash scene which I found tasteless and cringey. This just proves that sometimes giving someone full control of a product doesn't make it a better one, it just makes it a more personal mistake (which is a good thing, don't get me wrong). And it just proves that in this world of social media, people are losing their ability to have an unbiased view, as everything is built on hype and marketing and whoever shouts louder knows best. As the guys in RedLetterMedia said before me, Josstice League was a butchered mess while this is just an unbutchered one.", "Rights the wrong of the 2017 version": "That Zack Snyder's Justice League exists is amazing enough; that it justifies its long and arduous journey to peoples screens around the world is even more amazing, with the sour aftertaste of the 2017 Joss Whedon overseen cut now a long distant memory we can now all erase.After years of fan outcries and much industry speculation, Snyder finally was able to secure the budget and distribution he needed to get back into the editing suite (and even shoot two additional scenes, including a great Joker addition) to finish off his original vision for a film he was forced to abandon due to personal circumstances and it proves to us all that while in no way, shape or form is this Justice League a cinematic masterpiece, it does showcase a grand and far more well-rounded vision than what we originally saw with the hacked up 2 hour Whedon theatrical cut.Clocking in at a bum-numbing 4 hours (a quarter of which seems to be in Snyder slow-motion), League is a long in the tooth tail that doesn't necessarily fully justify its excessive runtime and Snyder could've done well to be harsher in the editing room with his films opening 90 or so minutes in particular but it also feels like the film the initial version only slightly threatened to be, with the whole ensemble (particularly The Flash and Cyborg) getting their time to shine this time around and the characters they portrayed finally feeling like fully formed and worthy incarnations of their beloved comic-book selves.Separated into titled chapters and filmed in the old-school 4:3 aspect ratio just like Snyder had initially intended the film to be seen in, the rushed and uninteresting narrative of what we saw in 2017 has given way here too a more in-depth and involving story, that while still dealing with the typical alien invading forces that litter these type of films, is now a more character orientated tale that feels as though it works even when its not throwing CGI fights at us on frequent occasions.Key to the success of this is the fleshing out of the performances of all the cast and while Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman and Jason Momoa's Aquaman still feel underwhelming here, the charm of Gal Gadot, the comedic smarts of Ezra Miller, the brooding presence of Henry Cavill and the far more memorable role of Ray Fisher ensure that while not on Avenger's level of ensemble goodness, Justice League finally feels like a family of hero's we can care about and get around, making their quest to save the world far more enjoyable this time around.As is to be expected from any movie overseen by Snyder, the action sequences in this iteration of Justice League also feel far more fleshed out and eye-catching than Whedon's Russian family in distress moments and while some CGI work has aged fairly poorly here, there's little denying that Snyder remains one of the best action directors in the business and perfectly captures the various epic moments that these such characters can find themselves in when fighting alien baddies hellbent on uncovering some magical Rubik's Cubes.Proof of what can be achieved when studios take a back-seat and original vision enacted upon, this Justice League is a movie treat we never really knew we needed and perhaps a door being opened for the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad....on second thought maybe not such a good idea.Final Say -Righting the wrongs of the previous cut of the film, Zack Snyder's Justice League may not be a cinematic marvel or an out and out classic but its an enjoyable and old-school like epic filled with lots of goodness, one that shows the world a good Justice League movie is well and truly achievable.3 1/2 Hot Dogs out of 5.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League Review": "Listen, I'm very happy Zack Snyder was able to get his vision out there and I'm happy people are liking it. That doesn't mean though that this film is perfect just because it was released. Yes the film is a MAJOR improvement over 2017's Justice League but this film still brings some of those problems over to this film such as the poor writing. The dialogue in this film is still almost just as stilted as it was in Justice League however, there are no awful jokes to ruin the pacing of the film which I do appreciate. The writing in Justice League was god awful and this was still bad but not as bad. Gal Gadot's, Henry Cavill's, and Amy Adam's performances are still just as awkward as they were in the original film. I still find some of their line delivery laughable bad but Ray Fisher's performance was definitely an improvement because he was given an actual character this time. In the previous film, him and The Flash were just kinda there and now they have some role in the film which I did like. I do think Ray Fisher's Cyborg is honestly the best part of the film. He's pretty great. Stepphenwolf was better than he was in Justice League but I still felt that he was kinda one dimensional. Trust me that he isn't as bad in Justice League but I still found him uninteresting. This runtime is absolutely not justified. It did not need to be 4 hours long because the first half is a slog to sit through. I found myself nodding off a few times and having to rewind because I didn't know what happened. This film isn't all bad though. Like I said, Cyborg is great and the visual effects are a huge improvement. Plus, the cinematography is pretty fantastic at points. Some of the action is well done and I did enjoy the second half of the film. Like I said, I'm happy Snyder was able to release this and I think it's a worthy addition to the DCEU but it isn't flawless. Check this out if you enjoy this universe or are interested in seeing what Snyder's vision was.", "Enjoyable with the Usual Caveats...": "I enjoyed this much more than the first release. As someone else said, one understood the motivations of the characters a bit more.That said, has anyone noticed that, no matter how powerful the super evil being his, his lackeys ALWAYS have 1) terrible aim when shooting, 2) can easily be killed/dispatched with a punch to the face (I guess aliens have the same organs in the same places, although that's pretty unrealistic) or being impaled on a spike and 3), are usually inept without being told EXACTLY what to do. I mean, regarding my second point, The Martian Manhunter's heart is not in the place where human's hearts are, so why are Darkseid's minions? This is a general flaw when there are aliens, Men in Black being one of the few exceptions. Everyone has the same physiology. It would be nice to see exceptions, except that would make the filmmakers jobs much harder, I suppose Still....(sigh). And the dialogue is still pedestrian, as in many of these movies. Steppenwolf grabs Cyborg to prevent him from separating the mother boxes and Cyborg yells, \"Get the hell off me!\" Yes, THAT'S what you tell someone who's trying to kill you, right? A bit more sophistication in screenwriting would be welcome. It seems that no matter what century a movie takes place in, one hears \"Seriously\" and \"Lets do this.\" (I'm 100% certain that Elizabethans never uttered the phrase \"lets do this\". EVER.) But dialogue is the common thread that keeps movies from achieving greatness (even if the movie itself is likable). Oh, well...Also, there must be two edits of this movie. I've seen it before, and there were scenes that are not in this one, such as the resurrection of Superman. It's just SLIGHTLY different than when I watched it before, but I found myself asking, \"Why didn't_______ (insert a superbeing's name) say what he said last time?\"\nAnd plot holes: any old earth technology can blow up an alien force field quit easily. Or any other earth weapon. Are there no aliens who are immune to guns, or don't get knocked out by a punch to the solar plexus? Apparently not. Nice to know we're all built the same, no matter what Universe we come from. OY.As for the length: I must be older than most of you (I KNOW I am: I'm 72), but I remember when I was young, we would go to the movies at 1 pm and not come out until 5 pm. It was what was then called \"a double feature.\" So, it would seem some of you need shorter movies (thank God Lord of The Rings was made when you were 5, or each movie would have been 100 minutes long, thereby ruining the magnificent saga that each movie turned out to be).Relax!!! Learn to sit and enjoy long movies and forget about the world (and your phones!).Good movie!!P. S. And someone forgot to tell the screenwriters that the Justice League never kills their enemies and most definitely NOT Diana (Wonder Woman). Yet, here, she cuts off Steppenwolf's head as he is hurtling back thru Darkseid's portal. The only other death was when Superman killed Zod previously and in the comic books, that was the FIRST time Superman had killed a foe. (Just a little background on DC heroes, at least in the 60s, 70s, 80s. Superman then killed Doomsday (who returned the favor!) in 1992.", "In comparison": "Chances are you've seen or heard enough about the original movie, so I consider this in relation to it.You know these things you hated about it?

This is Justice League, perfected.", "Engaging": "The plot may seem comparatively weak to other elements of the movie, but with visually pleasing action and good pacing, movie successfully manages to keep the audience engaged throughout even with 4 hours of screentime.", "The most ambitious live action of dc ever": "This movie is dark and serious most of the time. Having not watched Whedon's directorial, this movie give a better tone to Snyder's previous DCEU movies but they are still not good enough.As an MCU found this one extremely opposite to Avengers. JL didn't have perfect heroes and villains. We clearly get introduced their vulnerability from Batman's guilt to Darkseid's frightening wrath. This makes the movie more realistic than most of the superhero movies of the recent times\nVisuals are nothing above expected. Zack's direction deserves an applause. Actors were all perfectly cast. This clearly isn't a fun ride like MCU movies but clearly a movie with a heart and a memorable one.", "We did it! The Snyder Cut is here!": "So how was the final product?Was all of the hype finally worth?After years of petitioning the film was finally finished and the final film was pure Zack Snyder through and through.If you loved his take on Watchmen and the DC extended universe, this is for you.This movie has real heart, lots of slow mo and does these great characters justice.On top that the finished film was also shown in an unconventional (yet beautiful) aspect ratio- Something he could've never done in theaters.This is simply a beast of a film, make some time and check it out.", "Luckily I happen to have an IMAX screen laying around the house, said no one. Ever.": "Dumbest decision to release this one in IMAX format. It made my 120\" TV feel like a miserable puny 70\" TV.I enjoyed the 2017 version much better than the critics did then, and although this version was slightly more epic, for the extra two hours, it was still riddled with plot and technical issues. The score was overly dramatic I felt some scenes were out of a soap opera. But I did like the \"parts\" method of the story-telling.But let's talk about the elephant in the room; four hours? It's not like anything substantial was added in those extra two hours, and although there was more character development, that could've been done in less than an hour added to the 2017's 2 hour runtime. And we really didn't need so many slo-mo scenes to make it to the four hour runtime.So technically, I would've given this a 9, one star more than the 8 I gave the 2017 version, because it was a little better, but I have to take one back for the 4 hour runtime that could've been filled in with more substance than the extra filler. So this one is an 8/10 from me as well.", "YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!": "PERFECTION!!!!!\nAbsolute perfection!Sweet baby Jesus I'm a happy man right now!", "AMAZING!!": "AWESOME MOVIE! AWESOME CHARACTERS! ZACK SNYDER MADE A GREAT JOB!", "One of the best epics ever made": "I loved Man of Steel. Hated BvS and Justice League. Thought the DC cinematic universe was dirt. Then I saw BvS: Ultimate Edition and I thought that it was a much better film than the unwatchable theatrical release. So I was excited for The Snyder cut of Justice League - but I had no idea it would be this good. This film is the best DC movie and one of the best epics I've ever seen. The characters are great, the fights are amazing. Affleck proves he is a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. Jack Kirby's legendary Darkseid gets his overdue time to shine as the ultimate DC Villain. This movie is awesome. More please!", "Woo hoo!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a much needed film to replace the disaster that was the first Justice League. This movie did justice to Cyborg's character arc, and we get a better glimpse into who he is and what his motivations are. The new movie is much better paced, and Steppenwolf is more menacing and has a logical end goal. Certain scenes were also changed in this movie, all of which made the storyline more realistic in the context of its cosmology and gave the film a better flow. However, a problem I had with the movie was with Lois Lane. Similar to the original Justice League, she is relegated to a side position and really only serves as a love interest. It feels as if her character is wasted. Overall, this film was much better than the first version and is something you will definitely enjoy.", "Still Terrible": "Bow down Nolanites to your new gods. The torch has been passed to the new messiahs: Zack Snyder and Todd Phillips (as of 2019, everyone's favourite director)\nand in 2022 when The Batman inevitably enters the top 250, I fully expect Matt Reeves to join their ranks to form the Holy Trinity of Cinema Saviours.People act like this is the first time a studio succumbed to fanboy whining. As of early 2000s and the rise of the internet, comic nerds got their voices heard and studios started catering to their demands. They got their Joe Chill, their Superman punching, their funny books were taken \"seriously\" and they finally got validated as adults (oh the irony).While the Marvel movies are for kids and people on mental level of a child (kind of like MovieBob), Zack Snyder's movies are for edgy teenagers and 20-30-something year old pseudo-intellectuals (kind of like Christopher Nolan fanboys).Zack Snyder's Justice League is equally as bad as the theatrical or the Whedon cut, whatever you like to call it, only twice as long. Claims that this movie is so much different that the 2017 version are laughable, it's just alternate takes of the same scenes plus unused material leading to nearly identical conclusion. Adding more content to a shaky foundation does not a better movie make, the story is rotten at its core and no amount of additional footage and fan service can fix it.Steppenwolf is still an unconvincing CG mess with the personality of a wet paper bag. Then you have the CG Darkseid who, in a flashback, gets beaten and almost killed. Such an underwhelming way to introduce your main villain.The only part in this entire slog of a movie where it felt that Snyder had any kind of creative freedom is the brief Knightmare sequence (which was unfortunately ruined by Jared Leto), everything else is your generic superhero drivel.", "Good movie if you can sit for 4 hours": "Zack Synder's Justice League is a directors cut to the 2017 Joss Whedon version and features Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill,Gal Gadot,Amber Heard,Amy Adams,Jason Mormoa and Willem Dafoe. The movie opens with Zack Synder telling us about the film and then we see the film broken up into 6 parts.\nThey are as follows:\nDon't count on it Batman which sees Bruce Wayne(Affleck) meeting Aquaman(Mormoa) and Diana Prince along with the Amazons who unleashed a demon(voiced by Ray Porter who was Count Grisham in the 1999 animated flick The Scarecrow).The Age Of Heroes where we see Flash(Elza Miller) searching for a job and saves a woman in a crash while Batman and Wonder Woman (Diana) team up to defeat Darkhold(I think that's his name the demon). While Lois Lane(Amy Adams) is mourning the death of Superman(Henry Cavill)Beloved Mother/Beloved Son where we see Cyborg becoming Cyborg due to a car crash which left his mother for dead.Change Machine,All The Kings Men(especially The Kings Men) where Clark Kent aka Superman comes back to life.Something Darker where Flash, Wonder Woman, Cyborg,Batman and Superman must defeat Darkhold.And finally the Epilogue: A Father Twice Over.If your a fan of DC comics and their movies as well as sitting through a film for a whopping 4 hours then check it out.My only grip was the running time,which had some scenes that were pointless in my opinion and just made it drag on and on. Also there is alot of violence and blood in this film. Another gripe was why the ratio 4:3. Overall I did enjoy this film but it should have been on for 3hrs or less than 4 hours.", "What a difference a Director makes": "Night and day from the theatrical release. Finally, a movie that showed the full potential of the DC universe when properly and thoughtfully curated. Of course, Warner Brothers has blown it again by shelving follow on projects. They need to rethink that and just hand it to Snyder with a big check and turn him loose.", "It's good, not the greatest": "It's not a masterpiece but it is a decent comic book film. The longer runtime does provide more time for better character development which is something I don't feel a 2-hour movie can do adequately when you have many characters. But not all of the backstories are created equal. Some of the backstories are better than others. I didn't care for Cyborg father's preachy tone or Cyborg diatribe to his father.I really did like the scenes of Wonder Woman deflecting bullets with her metallic bracelets. I have always wished her previous standalone movies showed more of that. I like this Wonder Woman better than what DC given us with WW 1984.The CGI isn't always consistent in quality. The CGI landscape of Themyscira looked like graphics from a video game. Some of the physics in the action scenes weren't accurate.I did like Jared Leto's new long hair Joker. Unfortunately Ben Affleck looks like he has packed quite a few pounds between takes. In some scenes he looks like a young mid 20 year old, in other scenes he looks like a 50-year old with a spare tire around the hips.I loved the new black suit (CGI graded) Super Man suit Henry Cavill adorns. He looks really great in this cut of the film.Lastly, I detested the 4:3 ratio and I don't buy into the \"creators intent\" nonsense. When this new cut was in production, Zack knew very well this film would be watched mostly on home 16:9 TVs. I really hated the vertical black bars on the sides. Fortunately around the 2 hour mark I remembered my TV, as well as most TVs, allow the user to modify the aspect ratio. On my LG OLED, it was able to do this intelligently without much distortion if any at all. So I was able to watch the last two hours in 16:9I am giving the film a 7 out of 10 because comic book films really do benefit from a darker theme instead of lighter ones. I don't think it is the best comic book film ever made. I heard that claim with in 4 hours of its release the morning HBO made it available and in my opinion that statement is waaay premature when most people have not even seen the film. But nonsense spreads quickly over social media today and lightening speeds by fanboys and 13-year-olds. It's a good film for a comic book film, just not a masterpiece.", "Super overrated": "I thought the Snyder/Whedon Justice League was the best DC movie since the Nolan Batman Trilogie. Don't know why some wanted a Snyder Cut, but I gave it a try. This version stands for everything that's wrong with the current DC movies: just making it dark and looooooonnng is just not enough. This movie changed some, added few, but told everything in slow motion. Watching the Flash constantly in slo-mo got me angry. That's not art, that's nonsense. Only plus point is that Barry Allen is still fun to watch. I still like to watch Ben Affleck as Batman, but it's a pity that he was it in such poor movies.Putting that movie in a 4:3 ratio just to mark it as the Snyder cut is ridiculous!", "I Need Some form of Sequel": "Restore it.

Much cooler Flash, and basically all the characters.", "Worth watching": "ZSJL is a unique DCEU gilm with massive BGM and long and uncut. This film showed what superhero movie with deep and dark and slow-mo is. Zack is good at creating slow-mo movies with massive BGM. That point is to feel the emotions of the characters like Wonder woman, the flash and Cyborg. He also put unity comparing with old ages and new era.

It's a must see.", "The Breathtaking, True Spiritual Sequel to Batman v Superman": "I remember sitting through the first Justice League movie in 2017 and having to experience a strange anger that I've never dealt with before while watching a movie. As someone who loves everything Zack Snyder has done for what was the DCEU, I couldn't temper the rage building within me as I watched Justice League, mutilated by Joss Whedon, wondering and knowing what could have been. Resigned to fate, I begrudgingly finished it with little hope that Batman v Superman would ever have its true, spiritual successor.Four years and numerous online social media movements (#releasethesnydercut) bannered by proud, unrelenting fans later, that true successor has finally arrived. Now, I am overjoyed; to be given a chance to see something amazing, to partake in the sort of art that invites sensory pleasure and witness the creative vision of Zack Snyder at the helm of bringing some of the most fantastic, awe-inspiring stories to life, nearly suffocated at birth yet brought to its fruition, leaves one extremely gratified, hopeful, and thankful. A second chance- not wasted. Zack Snyder's Justice League forced an audible \"WOW\" from between my lips numerous times. Just the first 10 minutes of this film is substantially better than the whole of Justice League in its entirety. Despite its four hours length, I couldn't be bothered to move from my seat, take a break, or be distracted in any way from this genre defining epic. I was absolutely hooked, transfixed the entire time. Our heroes finally received the introduction they deserve as a team, and I'm especially thrilled how Cyborg's story acts as a conduit that binds everyone together and keeps the narrative flowing naturally.As much as I love the MCU, I much prefer the tone and tenor of Zack Snyder's vision and directing. There's a raw aggression, yet beautiful vulnerability and mercy to how these heroes are portrayed, saddled with the burden of power, responsibility, and morality unlike what's seen from similar material in the MCU. And these heroes carry that burden hard, and they carry it well. Even Wonder Woman's portrayal in Snyder's films is better, handled with more precision and respect than her solo movies along with Zack having provided the finest on-screen Batman to date. I can't praise this film enough from its stunning imagery to its soundtrack to its pacing; derived of a visionary unmatched in his talents and execution.Of this moment and matter, there's only one thing that is warranted needing desperately to be said, those at Warner Bros needing desperately to hear, acknowledge, and to heed: RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE.", "So much better": "Joss whedons version of justice league lacked heart, coherency, character development, and plot.\nZack Snyder's justice league does not.

The cinematography in this film is beautiful, the music wonderful and the dialogue was a vast improvement on the original.\nSometimes I felt the slow motion at the start was a bit over the top, and I think many people will dislike how long it is and how it isn't totally like an MCU movie (no hate, I like the MCU movies too), but personally I forgot how long it was when I was watching it. 10/10, a very fulfilling movie and worth the wait", "Take Your Time w/ It!": "Of epic proportions in all ways, Justice League is the comic book action dream. 4 hours of woven story lines and battles and reviving of the man of steel himself.", "Outstandingly brilliant.": "This is the perfect answer to Marvel's Avengers Endgame.

Beautifully shot, fantastic action and lots of heart.... well done to the release the cut movement and well done Zack.", "The League Justly United": "2017's \"Justice League\" assembled with glaringly obvious, shoddy and appalling reshoots and edits from a greedy theatrical release mandate, was like in style of a sort of Victor Frankenstein in a laboratory, stitching an abhorrent creation together of mismatched ugly limbs - the reshot and altered scenes wedged in the movie's cut runtime - immorally meddling with what was once robust life... \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\", and desperately hoping the final form would harmonize into a fan satisfying and coherent movie. Ultimately, 2017's didn't. It was an abomination. An unprecedented failure and insult to fans of the beloved DC characters this movie sourced from.On the other hand, THIS movie, 2021's \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" in fortunate contrast, is undeniably the superior version. As an avid fan and reader of the source comic characters (this movie's incarnation clearly taking much inspiration from the New 52 comics version of the core characters) this movie satisfied what elements I had yearned of from a live-action Justice League movie.The action scenes are a pleasure to watch in \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" via stunning cinematography and combat choreography with as much aesthetic composition sensibility as panels of a comic book. Whether it's Batman grapnel glide kicking a Parademon, Wonder Woman's motion blur deflecting streams of bullets with her gauntlets (clearly reminiscent in style of panels from \"Wonder Woman: Year One\" (2016)) or Darkseid's ominous foot squashing Steppenwolf's head within camera frame, it looks artistically conscientious for the utmost epic intent.A particular aspect I want to express that I really liked of \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is the depiction of the heroes' support and teamwork with one another as the film progresses. Each Justice League member have individual crucial moments of the plot that solely rely on their separate strengths and capabilities, moments dependent on each, showing and proving each member's validity to the team as a whole - why they need each other in certain situations and predicaments. Some examples of many include:The Flash alone reversing time and altering the Justice League's assumed defeat and destruction.Aquaman alone being a stronghold preventing a wall of water from engulfing the team.Batman being the movie's narrative catalyst (uniting the team and encouraging the team) and later using his tactical vehicle resources to destroy the Mother Box unity dome to then lure away the parademons so that the remaining League members could access and attack Steppenwolf directly.There's more that can be listed, but to lessen length, the team synergy of separate strengths stemmed from individualized predicaments is an aspect I feel is lacking or absent in other ensemble universe movies of the genre - 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame\" an egregious comparative example to me. Cameos and an expansive cast of characters, seemingly just for the sake of scope. An ingredient for good characterization is that each character must have meaning and if their particular absence wouldn't affect the plot's evolution - its conflict and its means for resolution - then they have no reason to be included within the story. \"Avengers: Endgame\" has many characters not contributing to the movie's particular narrative (Winter Soldier, War Machine, Falcon, etc.) aside from joining among the charging mob as fan inclusion set-pieces or to fill a poster, nothing more. \"Justice League\" in contrast to that aforementioned movie has legitimate need of all its team members. Without a member and their participation, the story would crumble. And to make clear, I'm critical of this being a DC and MARVEL fan.I'm going to conclude this, because I could go on and on about what I liked of \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" being a comics fan, but I don't believe I really need to delve further of things because those who followed the evolution of this movie from 2017 should be fully aware of the better content this version has in comparison that was previously and heartlessly reshot and cut away. It's presence is very evident while watching \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" through. To end this, we fans finally have a live-action Justice League movie that's a satisfying experience of these beloved characters.", "Decent movie but overhyped": "Overhyped would be the perfect word.surely better than the other justice league movie,but 4 hours runtime makes it boring,with a known story .", "Now this a hero team up worth wild!": "After the horrible experience of the Josstice League, I was waiting for this. I new that the theatrical one was going to be bad(not being a fan of Joss Whedon Avengers), but knew that their was a better cut off this movie. Everything is better and the 4 hour does not feel long, I even wanted more. This movie knew how to make each character feel important and relevant, not like the Avengers that the story was bad and the situation and why they needed to unite was trash. ZSJL have heart, determination and a awesome soundtrack now. I wish marvel could do something epic like this.", "This film is litt.": "Waiting for the snyder cut since 3years and the director didn't disappoint me.", "A must watch": "This is far better than theater cut.. it's like you're watching a whole new movie\nAction , Cinematography , Background Score , CGI & Editing everything is top notch level", "Cheesy dialog, horrible acting but amazing CGIs": "This movie is saved only by the amazing computer generated imagery. The acting and poor script with the cheesiest ever dialog, pulls it down to the lowest depth. It is fun and entertaining if one can get past the rubbish script and acting. The highest ratings will probably come from DC comic fans and not from movie buffs who would expect more from a film!", "Saved the latest DC disaster": "As a DC fan i was kinda disappointed about the last dc movies like Batman vs superman suicide squad justice League 2017 ww84. Zack Snyder confirms that his is the only film maker (for now) for dc. All these extra scenes made me feel like i was watching a brand new movie. The action scenes, the acting, got me in DCU again. Looking forward for the next one.", "Way better": "Where was this cut before? Why did whedon ignore all this gem footage he had when he made his cut? There was so much more back story, and hints for the future if DC in the Snyder cut.", "Zack Snyder's justice league": "Zack Snyders justice league\n2021\n15\nDirector: Zack Snyder\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Mamoa, Jeremy Irons, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Ciaran Hinds etcOverall rating 99/100Zack Snyders Justice league, is the official directors cut and Zack Snyder's version of the 2017 film of the same name, determined to ensure Superman's ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. What an incredible film this was, this is the justice league we should of got instead of the mess from four years ago, they fixed everything that was wrong with the original and added more, let's get started talking about this masterpiece of a film.My first few positives would be the cinematography, soundtrack, action, added context to particular scenes and better CGI and character designs. I thought the cinematography in this film was so much better than the original cut, it just had Zack Snyder's signature style all over it I loved it, the movie had so much more of a bigger scope and some truly beautiful shots with some great usage of slow motion that just made those particular scenes sink in that little bit better. I also thought the soundtrack was great, it got me excited gave more of an epic atmosphere to the film and there was some really interesting song choices that really worked for me. I also thought that the action was incredible, there was so many more action scenes that were so well choreographed and so entertaining to watch, you could really just sit back and enjoy the film, I was often in awe at a lot of the action scenes and their scope, with a lot more usage of the characters powers which I loved. I also loved that they added so much more scenes to give everything more depth and context. The original cut just didn't make sense, but this film filled all of the holes that the original had and had a much more clear and effective structure and plot and explained everything so you knew more about the characters and the stakes involved it made the movie so much better. I also really appreciated the improved CGI and character designs, the action scenes just looked better, and the film as a whole just looked more polished, I especially liked the significantly improved character design for Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds).My next few positives would be the rising of tension, the building of emotional stakes, the added character depth the amazing work on the villain setting his goals more clearly, and the use of gore. The movie did a brilliant job at building tension, I think due to it being split between multiple parts it gave the film a lot more time to build its tension, with more intense character and villain moments as well as action scenes, I was on the edge of my seat. I also loved the rising of stakes both emotionally and in general, this movie just had so much more riding on the heroes being successful, there was so much more thought into the characters and their relationships each and everyone had something to fight for and it really came across so therefore the stakes felt much bigger. I also loved the added character depth, all of characters had added depth to them, but in particular Flash and Cyborg, in the original cut they were thrown into the film without any form of background or development and they were just rushed, and I didn't really care about either character, but this time we got to learn so much more about their characters, their personalities and their relationships I genuinely cared about both of the characters so much more. I also loved the work the movie did with Steppenwolf, not only was his character design so much better, but his action scenes were also great, he seemed more like a threat. So much to the point where I didn't know whether he could be defeated, but they added much clearer goals and motivations to his character with trying to impress a higher power, and his character actually had layers to him which is rare for villains in superhero movies. Finally I also loved the effective use of gore, I loved that this cut was R rated, it made the action scenes so much more entertaining, whilst also making Steppenwolf come across as much more of a threat. I preferred the film being much darker.My next few positives would be the character background and performances, the characters had more personality. There was added depth to the relationships in the movie, as well as better humour and chemistry between the cast. I loved the added character background to a lot of the characters especially Cyborg, this was a great added element because it established his tough relationship with his father well, raising the emotional stakes for his character and giving him more depth as well as just adding more depth to their relationship which is what the film did much better with the whole cast, especially with Lois and Clark. I also thought all of the performances were great, the whole cast did a fantastic job they all managed to show a great versatility with the action scenes and the more emotional scenes for their characters, in particular Ray Fisher and Amy Adams shined. I also loved that the characters had more of a personality and their was a better chemistry between the whole cast. In the original cut we didn't really get to see what the different characters were like and how they interacted with people, there was no hint of any form of personality, but in this case the characters really had their times to show off more of their different personalities and it was really fun to watch and made you connect to them all much better. Because of this the cast had a great chemistry, it felt more like an ensemble and they were all working together, that was one of the big things missing from the original cut, it also bought some much needed comedy as they all could joke around with each other, Ezra Miller was a particular stand out.My only slight nit-pick that stopped the movie from being completely perfect for me was the slight over usage of slow motion. When it was needed it really worked to create a more epic atmosphere and focus on that particular scene, but some of the slow motion felt unneeded and slightly annoying in parts, it took you out of the movie slightly.My final few positives would be the fantastic script, incredible final act, great character arcs and satisfying ending, whilst also possibly setting up future projects well. The script was just so well crafted and written, the structure of the film was spot on, and the dialogue was moving and there was some really great moments that let the characters shine and offered insightful views on how people live their life and appreciate the people in it. I also thought the final act was just incredible. It was an entertaining thrill ride, the action was incredible, it was intense, the stakes for all the characters were insane and the final fight was just fantastic, I was in superhero heaven. I also loved the character arcs, every single character had a satisfying arc that really tied the film in a nice little bow, it spent time establishing what each character had done and their relationships with their loved ones and it was just so well written. I also loved the epilogue, it was a nice surprise to see Jared Leto back as the joker, I always thought the deserved a second chance and he did a fantastic job. I loved that the movie set up future projects, although I am not sure whether they will be made it was still nice to see Zack Snyder's creative vision for the film truly fulfilled.Overall, Zack Snyder's justice league was just incredible. It literally fixed all the plot issues from the original cut, adding way more character depth, context to scenes, and made me care more about the characters. Giving them a much better team dynamic and spending time on each character. This is the Justice league DC fans deserved. Zack Snyder's creative vision really shone through the whole film, and its my personal favourite film in the DC universe.", "Everyone is definitely over rating this movie.": "Reading through these reviews and everyone's giving it 9s and 10s , it's clear these guys no know nothing about films or Dc comics , the whole Snyders cut was heavily heavily teased centred around darkseid , but he doesn't actually make a proper appearance , in the teaser posters revealed in the trailer you're under the assumption the main focus will be darkseid but it's not. Feel like I've been scammed of 4 hours of my life , it's a good movie better than the first version , but the expectations were a bit too high.", "The music sucked and made some of this impossible to watch!": "All the good reviews only mean that we live in a zombie world! Some of this movie was spectacular while some of it should've stayed out of the movie! It did explain a lot but some parts were still unnecessary!", "Good, but hardly profound": "The much-heralded 'director's cut' version of JUSTICE LEAGUE, expanded to four hours. I ended up enjoying this on par with the original film, but for very different reasons. Obviously the story is much better here, but it's simply too long-winded at four hours and the whole chapter thing feels a little arrogant. The film ends up as the usual CGI overload with little basis in reality or following the laws of physicals, and that whole epilogue flash forward dream sequence is just confusing and feels unnecessary, like a tacked-on trailer for something else. On the plus side, the back stories are fun and the actors work hard to make this all come together, but at times this felt more like SUCKER PUNCH than WATCHMEN.", "For zack": "Movie rating 9 good job zack you are one of the bests.", "Forget the critics": "Forget the critics this is a great movie.

And The Quotes!#RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "The True Justice League": "In 2017, WB promised huge with their Justice League film, which was initiated by Zack Snyder, but due to the sudden demise of his daughter, he left the project, which led to Joss Whedon being the director WB brought in to complete Justice League. His heavy reshoots have not only added to the cost of the film to be $300 million dollars, but it also left fans devastated and it turned out to be a major disappointment, according to the fans and also by the box office. The fans then rallied for the true vision of Snyder to be released. Years and years of campaigning have brought this version of Justice League.Zack Snyder's Justice League is the most rewarding experience a DC fan can have if they have been following Zack's trilogy. It provides everything a comic book fan wanted to see in the 2017 Justice League Version. More Cyborg and More Flash. Zack Snyder's Justice League leaves you wanting for more! It's action packed 6 Part Film will make you fall in love with its characters.", "Injustice ... fixed": "I am in disbelief at what I watched. This cannot be the original vision. If so, how can the studio have released the previous edition? Zack Snyder put together a excellent superhero movie. An easy 7 of 10. It wasn't perfect. There were 3 or 4 eh moments. I can handle an average of 1 per hour. The story is the same. The characters are exhibited so much better. The plot holes from the other are easily explained here, making the other movie bearable!

But there was way too much needless dialog between characters. And the action scenes had no organic feel to them. They felt choreographed. Yes, of course they're choreographed but they're not supposed to feel that way.Steppenwolf was as boring a villain as I've ever seen. He's pathetically one-dimensional. Just a big chrome-plated dude with a gravelly voice. DC villains are normally interesting and engaging. Not this guy.Momoa did his usual good work, but his script was awful. He was nowhere nearly as likeable as he was in the Aquaman movie. Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams and Gal Gadot imo did the best acting overall.This flick is too long, too predictable and flat-out dull.

Clocking at four hours long and still stuck with patchy narratives, 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' is needlessly overlong and needs significantly fewer scenes in slow motion. But with its meaty back story and Junkie XL's fantastic original score, this movie appears more coherent than Joss Whedon's messy theatrical cut that was released in 2017. Snyder's vision also restores the most important thing Whedon cut out of his 'Justice League': its heart.", "A Definite Improvement": "Like night and day. The original was awful, this is a far superior movie.", "Fan boy unicorn epic.": "It's here. The movie the fans were clambering for. The movie that would end all movies. Even though no proof existed that Zack Snyder was a talented film maker or even had any good movies under his belt. Stylistic movies sure, but actual GOOD movies? No.This is a long film. A lot of images flash before the viewer. There\u00b4s even some attempt to add some character arcs and backstory but it fails to add any depth or interest into the story. This looks like a video game cut scene and without playing the game I am completely uninvested.Is it better than the first Justice League? Sure. The action scenes are better. It\u00b4s not AS terrible looking as the last one. But where was Batman? Or Superman? They had little to nothing to do in this movie and all the others were animated in from time to time but added as much flavour as a sugar cube in a glass of coke.I understand this will make money, I understand that fans wanted to believe this would be great. And they will fool themselves into thinking that even after watching. Because no one wants to lose face. People want to defend the undefendable in order to feel good.This is a growing problem everywhere not just in movies.Sadly this problem lost me four hours of my life.", "Zack Snyder's love letter to all of us": "I will try to keep it short. It has heart and soul, two important things which Whedon's version clearly lacks. Its four hours are used very good, each character has enough space to grow and you have a chance to get \"under their skin\". Do not be scared of the long runtime though, I was never bored, it never stopped being interesting. Music is pretty crazy, there is a choir, electric guitar, orchestra (obviously) and even a few previously released songs, including Hallelujah, which gives the movie nice emotional feel (Zack devoted it to his daughter and put her favourite songs in). Overall, the music is pretty diverse but works fine, since every hero has very different style and personality.Almost every shot is like a small masterpiece, Zack is geting better with every project. Big raw IMAX fomat was great. I grew up on comic books, where most of the panels are vertical. This format gives the movie something I never knew I would like. Zack uses it cleverly, when he wants to make the scene big, it feels epic and spectacular. But when he wants the nerve-wrecking opposite, it is damn claustrophobic.Final rating: My mind is freaking blown and I need much more!", "Masterpiece": "Like all DC fans, I've been eagerly awaiting this day. 4 years later, Zack righted every wrong.\nAs a lifelong diehard Batman fan, I was so incredibly happy to see Affleck finally get a fair chance at this amazing character.\nThat's the Batman of DC Comics in live action form. It was amazing to witness.And the epilogue sent me to the moon.I know the word is that Zack and most of this cast are done, but I don't want to imagine a future universe without any of them.

It rises well above anything marvel has done.", "Justice was overdone done with this League": "Four Hours. I would not sit through this in a movie theater. But thanks to HBO MAX the vision of Zack Snyder was on display for all to see. I liked it then again, but not so much. CGI is a wonderful thing when placed in the right hands. The back-stories were there, the writer and editing led by Snyder did not bog us down with what is already well-known for the DC followers. Casting is everything, and it was well done for this movie. But you must admit that all of the activities after the death scene of the Steppenwolf character, could have waited for a sequel. This was Snyder overkill and would serve as more of a punishment for anyone dropping $20 at a theater more than a reward for sticking it out for 4 hours. And did you want to sing along with the closing credit singing of Hallelujah? I sure did. I won't watch this again.", "Never dissapoints": "I feel bad for people who belittle and refuse to watch this film. Zack Snyder is truly a genius and never disappoints.", "The best comic book movie": "This is an epic movie, perhaps the best comic book to date. Some people say it was too long, but the film is watched in one breath, even twice in a row. He's so good.p.s. Some primitive people complain about the 4:3 format with which the film was shot. But these people have never heard of composition. And that every frame in the film is designed to be perfect. This format is used to see more of the image. If it was at 16:9 it would be less visible.

But is it really one of the greatest superhero movies, definitely arguable. Tests patience a lot with 4hrs run time. One thing I'm really depressed was using most important character Darkseid so early, we saw how Thanos hype was created over a decade for one great moment. I feel that the great potential was wasted. Maybe that's why WB wanted to cut off Darkseid on theatrical version.", "Chance of Redemption": "The Snyder Cut makes a compelling case for returning to Zack Snyder's original vision for an expanded DC cinematic universe. While the running time is signifIcantly longer than a typical movie, there are well-placed intermissions that allow you to pick a good time to pause and pick up later. With a culture of people accustomed to binge watching four episodes of their favorite shows at a time, the complaint of a lengthy run time seems almost hypocritical, if fair on its face.\nThere are multiple story arcs hinted at in Joss Whedon's film that are more fully expanded on in the new cut. Some of which threaten to run out of steam before the end credits, but which follow through to a satisfactory epilogue to what may be the swan song of the Zack Snyder DCEU.\nMost importantly, each character of the JL is expanded on in important ways. While each backstory may seem a little disjointed at first, the assorted ends of thread end up weaving together a more cohesive (and believable) team.\nAll in all, a great chance of redemption for the long suffering fan base. Gossip is sure to swell and searches for a Justice League Snyder Cut sequel will run rampant. And perhaps, with a little time and the same fan-fueled energy that brought this cut of the film to life, we may yet see a return to what was promised as the first foray into a DCEU. And if not, it is surely a more fitting end to it.", "Best Super Hero Team-up movie": "Even Avgengers(2012) wasn't so great like SJL.

This movie improved Flash and Cyborg a lot to a point that they are honestly the most well crafted characters in the movie. The story is fine, didn't impress me but at least now i can understand the motivations of the character and the story itself in a much clearer way. The cgi is overral pretty good (even though there are some scenes that are weird) and the cast was overral... fine. Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck felt to me that their hearts were not really into the movie, Henry Cavill was good but i wish that he had more screen time, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher to me were the best (it's kinda sad to think that such a controversial person as Ezra Miller was great here).The 4 hours could've been easily cut, there are some scenes with Louis Lane for example that feel meaningless and drag the movie a bit.

Things look pretty cool. Unfortunately, this movie started with the ending of another movie (BvS) that had the same aesthetic...but also had a ridiculously sucky third act. Maybe Batman will stop with the empty serious stares by the last hour of this one. Quick, somebody say his mom's name!Hour 2: I'm getting a sense of why this movie is so long, because fairly simple plot points and backstories sure get lots of extended attention (and prolonged moments of silence). Then again I totally follow the story and motivations! Which is not always Snyder's strength. Visuals remain cool, pace remains off.Hour 3: Hey look! Rock music, super teams, and cool looking action set pieces. It took a couple hours, but I suppose that makes sense since we had not met 3/5 of the heroes (and really most of the characters) beforehand. Then again, you also have to wonder why I'm supposed to care so much about characters I barely knew. Regardless, this was my favorite hour thus far, even if I continue to feel like this version of Superman is kind of a dick.Hour 4: So these movies generally suffer from big muddy CGI action finales that are hard to follow. No exceptions here. Plus, this time I did not even know what the heroes' powers were half the time. (Wait, can Aquaman fly?) That said, Superman looked about as cool as he ever has...no lip issues either. If only they could have made Cyborg look that cool. Anyway, it was fun to see the Justice League fight together, even if I did not actually care about any of them.Epilogue: Glad he added an epilogue.

Somewhere, I'm betting a documentary is in the works - or it should be.Suffice it to say that Snyder, whose daughter died by suicide while he was directing the movie, stepped away from the film. The 2017 release was far different in the hands of another director.Over the years, the fans clamored - particularly in an online campaign - to see \"The Snyder Cut.\" Now, finally, here it is.The central idea is that - sans Superman - Batman (Ben Affleck) needs to gather other superheroes to battle a foe who wants to destroy Earth.The music, incidentally, is great. I loved the score, the songs, and the placement of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah,\" sung by Allison Crowe (you saw her briefly as a pub singer in \"Man of Steel\") after Snyder's dedication to his daughter during the credits. (The song is part of a pivotal moment in Snyder's \"Watchmen,\" too.)Snyder planned for this to be the middle of a five-part series after \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v Superman.\"Now that the same fans who clamored for the Snyder cut to be released are demanding more \"Snyderverse\" films, who knows what will happen?Snyder's not broken.

So to learn that he had stepped down & Joss Whedon would be taking it over made me more than a little bit nervous. Especially knowing their drastically different tones. Finally seeing the finished product, well I was severely disappointed as it seemed everyone else was. I enjoyed very small pieces of the 2017 cut.

Ray Fisher got the respect he deserved after his treatment from Whedon. I truly didn't care about any one outside of the main DC Trinity since we hadn't been able to get to now them, but we did here & I fell in love with all of the characters! There wasn't obviously bad CGI, for the most part it all looked really great. The villains, big & small, each got more development. Introducing 2 new heroes that were hidden away in the DCEU was amazing! Ryan Choi being a fun 1 with so much possibility. Martian Manhunter being the standout cameo! So much more depth & development for literally everyone. It was nice to not have Wonder Woman as a sex object like Whedon tried to make her. We finally got so many of the amazing deleted scenes that featured Cyborg, Flash, Iris West, Mera & so many others.\nThe 1 big thing that bothered me is the \"Lois is the Key\" set ups.

Clunky, with awkward attempts at humour and characters who were not served well or given an opportunity to connect with their fans/audience.This version however was everything I wanted it to be. Each character given time to allow us to connect with them.

And Batman is a great character here, and he adds a lot to the story and action.I wish the \"Snyder-verse\" would continue, however I can understand Zack Snyder's wishes to no longer continue with the project.

I'm happy that Zack got a chance to show the world his version and clearly the world loves it. Hopes we get to see more of Zacks take on DC movies.", "Movie that we all wanted": "We have been waiting for justice for the Justice League for four years and as a reward we have received the ultimate experience of a full four hours. One hour for each year of waiting. I don't want to go into more or less well-known reasons and problems around filming the film and the campaign that pushed this director's version, but I'm extremely glad that this film managed to see the light of day. First I have to say that to me the original cinema version was not as bad as most, it was a fun pop corn movie, I enjoyed it to some extent, but of course I was sorry that DC was not able to make a great movie considering the original material .I have to admit I didn't expect a movie like this, it's completely different from the movie version, which is a compliment in itself. I thought I would watch the same or a similar movie only it would be a little longer with some extra scenes but luckily so I was wrong. Although a lot of new material has been added, various scenes have been thrown out so that a new, different film is being watched. The tone of the film is much darker, the level of humor is reduced which has led to us having one very serious superhero film with big stakes. Apparently Whedon insisted on that lighter and more witty tone because here it is reduced to almost a minimum. Visually the film is also completely different, the fight scenes look great and epic. As time went on more and more, I was more and more drawn into the film because of everything that was happening, and a lot of it happened. The greatest justice (I had to) was done to Flash and Cyborg who profited the most from this film and its duration, they got depth, background story, enough drama and emotion and because of that they became serious characters with their own motives. Speaking of motives, I have to add that this is exactly why the bad guys look better, that side of the story has been expanded, so they automatically gained weight as well. Everything is explained, even those who are not familiar with DC material and story can capture everything. The film really looks like one big meaningful epic whole that definitely deserves attention.\nNow I'm going to talk a little bit about bad things. Unfortunately, I have to mention the duration of the film. Although many characters have been given extra time on screen, which is a good thing, on the other hand, a four-hour film would almost never end up in the cinema, and it is a real pity, not to say a sin, that a film like this cannot be watched. in the cinema, on the big screen, which objectively and subjectively deserves. Maybe should have made a few \"smaller\" films that would later merge into a \"big\" project like the Justice League so then we wouldn't need a lot of story around the characters and their backgrounds because we would learn everything from their own origin films. Maybe because we'll never know.\nSometimes it seemed to me that the director was overdoing it with the use of slow motion. True, it's his signature and he uses it in almost all of his films, but he could have saved a few minutes like that.\nSome things are in the movie just because of the so-called fan service. Honestly, it was really nice to see them, they're cool, but they don't contribute absolutely anything to the film. This is especially true for the prologue.\nNow that this movie is out, we have another problem. Fans will definitely be looking for sequels, an extension of the story because it wouldn't be good if DC movies stopped at this because then this movie loses a certain meaning. After all, who doesn't care what happens next?", "All style, no substance": "I don't really know what I was expecting from Zach Snyder's Justice League. I had seen the original one and remember thinking little else other than complete waste of time. It wasn't as bad as Batman v Superman and definitely wasn't as bad as Wonder Woman 84, but it was bad. Now that I've seen this one, I can safely say it's better but still a bad movie. Zack Snyder as a director hasn't really grown any since 300. He's really good at making visually impressive movies, but he's flat out bad at telling stories and developing characters.I basically have the same complaints about Zack Snyder's Justice League as Justice League. There's no interesting villain, there are no interesting characters, it's too busy trying to play catchup and make an extended universe team-up, and everything is too serious and grumbly for its own good. Now with this cut you can also it's in 4:3 for no good reason and it's two hours longer.The added Darkseid stuff doesn't really add anything. It's basically there's one big bad looking for a doomsday plot device and then halfway through the movie the big bad finds a new doomsday plot device so the new big bad can come. Don't ask me how they forgot they left the new doomsday plot device on Earth, but they did and they were all surprised to find it. It's very dumb.Tacking two hours onto a bad movie doesn't make it better, it just makes it longer. Maybe if he hadn't relied so much on slomo he could have at least taken an hour off the run time.", "MASTERPIECE": "This movie has it all.very good script and awesome action sequences!", "Good movie": "The movie is definitely better than the first cut. But I wasn't expecting anything different since they already knew what was wrong with the first version.The movie in itself felt wholesome and I didn't feel it was 4 hours long since I was entertained every single minute. There was no boring moment. It is definitely a dark vision of Zack Synder.The acting is great. So are the visuals.It's a movie about how a team is better than one individual even when all of them are powerful by themselves and why we need this Justice League, much better than The Avengers.Overall a good movie in this time of super hero movies. Too many may be.", "Oh what could have been...": "Wow! What could have been? This movie provided a master class on stunning visuals, character development, and world-building. It's shocking the disparity between the theatrical release and this movie. Surprisingly even after the 4 hour run time, I was left wanting more. The cast was superb at making these impervious characters with godlike power experience pain, loss, and emotion. The existence of this film is cinematic history in and of itself is a miracle. A director's cut with zero studio interference and such a drastic difference from the studio's original release ever seeing the light of day is astounding. And I am so glad it did. Zack Snyder's Justice League was a superhero epic that created a theatrical masterpiece worthy of DC's greatest heroes.Overall : So long but so incredible! DC Comics fans rejoice! As an average movie-goer, it might be a bit too long for you.", "A bit long, and slow compare to the first version, but the action scene more bloody, and intense! Really should watch it!": "This film start with the flashbacks of Superman been sacrificed in \"Dawn Of Justice\", and the introduction of the Mother Boxes at different location scene! As turnout, this film is about Justice League need to prevent Steppenwolf to assemble all the three mother boxes, and take over the earth! Entire film quite long, and slow, but full of quite laughable scene, and bloody intense fighting scene! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, The Martian Manhunter fly to Bruce's house to offer help to defeat Darkseid! That's it! A quite entertain film!", "A vast improvement.": "While its duration and 4:3 aspect might seem off-putting at first, it is, in fact, very engaging. The excellent pacing makes the length almost unnoticeable. And the engrossing story changes and updated/restored visuals make the cropped ratio a non-issue.And because this cut fleshes out so many of the lesser characters with (good) backstories, it indeed makes the Justice League more of a team than Superman and Batman plus some other people. Everyone gets their emotional due. And it is all a very well-balanced ensemble picture. I could have done without the \"desert\" stuff with you-know-who hamming it up, or even all of the last twenty minutes of sequel set-up. But otherwise.Also, no insult to Danny Elfman but the Junkie XL score is quite refreshing.The original was a ho-hum mess; this version, while not perfect, is quite entertaining. It does not come across as self-indulgent or unnecessary. It actually feels like a warranted correction.", "Please: this is not a great movie!": "Zack Snyder's Exhausted League.\"Same problems, longer outcomes\". I'd say that - years from now - what's going to be remembered, well that would be the exaggerated movement which led to this movie's release rather than the movie itself that is, quite frankly, a bit trashy and ridiculous.What this \"Snyder's Cut\" ultimately does is confirming to everybody who happens not to be a fanboy just how deep down Hollywood superhero blockbusters have sunk in the last few years. We went all the way from \"The Dark Knight\" to \"WW84\" and this new abomination. But there's something more: this movie is also so long and overblown that it gets boring pretty soon. Pretty, pretty soon. Snyder should maybe learn to \"zack zack\" (read: cut) more while in the editing room.Now, the impression I got was that the real - gigantic - problem behind the 2017 theatrical cut wasn't actually (as a lot of those well-known loyal \"followers\" would like us to believe) the unbalanced combination of lighthearted (and somewhat stale) comedy and comically serious wannabe tragedy, but the very narrative, built upon the so-called \"foundations\" of a paper-thin script which was - and still remains - so poor that it produces in any case a never-ending string of implausibilities and silly moments that much embarrassing in places that you just have to look the other way not to notice them.And there really is a whole lot of unintentionally ridiculous moments in this movie, trust me. That's most probably one of the reasons why it looks like we were fed a rough cut rather than a polished and refined movie. A 4-hour-long rough cut with so-to-speak \"completed\" CGI that got released only because of insistent fans pressure and because in this particular pandemic situation which obviously plagued the movie business Warner Bros. Needed something to stream on their Hbo Max service so as to lure some subscribers in.So, now we have a movie full of what we can reasonably conceive as scenes that would've been cut for the most part in a normal post-production, 'cause they're useless or - as I already suggested - kinda ridiculous while desperately trying to be serious and profound (but c'mon how can you take that seriously a movie with a man who swims like he was a torpedo and a villain from another universe who looks like a giant shiny ram?). And - by the way - the least we talk about the pretentiousness of using the 4:3 format the better (I even read somebody comparing the B/W version to a Kurosawa movie... Which arouses the question: have you ever actually seen a Kurosawa movie?).Anyway, thanks to the aforementioned \"screenplay\" we're doomed to repeatedly hear and watch actors trying to deliver without laughing cringey lines that sends literal shivers down the spine owing to their banality (one example: in a fighting scene Steppen the Ram - sorry, Steppenwolf - says something like \"This one will be mine\" while on the verge of attacking, and Wonder Woman answers: \"I belong to no one\"... Now, how would anybody come up with something like that in such a situation? Again: c'mon!).That's not the end of it: the screenwriters also felt the need while writing to continuously explain every small thing like if this \"ZSJL\" was one unpredictable whodunit full of plot twists and turns. And not just another trite superhero blockbuster.So it went that being introduced to the wondrous world of \"Magical Intergalactic Boxes\", Darkseid who mysteriously appear to belong to the Dark Side (who would've guessed that, huh?), \"Silver Rams\" in techno-suits who keep on making service calls with the management, \"Parademons\" (the hell?) that look very much like giant intoxicated flies I really couldn't help it but burst into laughter, and that in spite of the absurd seriousness by which this and other baloney is presented.On top of that other things to be noticed are:The excessive amount of slow-mo sequences;The dark and gloomy cinematography thanks to which sometimes you can't see a thing during the action scenes (and to add to the confusion we have the most \"curious\" editing choices that produce situations in which one movement is repeated between cuts);The abominable soundtrack (just look at the Flash-saving-the-girl sequence: sloppy song and - to further the ridiculousness - flying hot dogs... OK...);The sometimes badly rendered computer graphic;The unconvincing performances (Cavill, Gadot, Affleck and Momoa are most probably the worst on this regard).In one sentence: blood, noise, CGI and thinly written plots. Here you go: what passes for \"great entertainment\" nowadays.In conclusion I only have one more thing to say, to all the fans out there praising this motion picture and wanting the \"Snyderverse to be restored\" and so on: \"ZSJL\" is not by any chance a masterpiece (it's amazing that I really need to point it out) and you giving 10-starred reviews here on Imdb is not going to change that.This movie is not going to be remembered and it's most certainly not going to be regarded as one of the greatest entertainment blockbusters of all time. Go take another look at \"The Dark Knight\" and then you'll hopefully finally realize that, while also realizing at the same time how in fact an outstanding entertainment movie is made even while having to deal with majors, marketing and big money and pressure.Oh, boy. Let's really hope we're done for good with the Snyderverse this time.", "Takes itself way too seriously": "Every clich\u00e9 in the book hits one after another as everyone tries to out seriousness everyone else.Not everything that happens needs to be accompanied with ancient Icelandic chanting.What the word pretentious was invented for, and if you thought the end of LOTR was tortuous...", "Thank you for this Zack Snyder!!!": "Unlike the previous disastrous attempt this one is actually perfect. Everything clicks, everything works, everything makes sense. Especially Barry Allen is way way better in this version. Boy did they wreck that in the version we are going to pretend never existed from now on.

Masterpiece": "What an awesome experience.First we finally know what roots of the story, great start.\nGot amazing partition of each arc, and each heroes background. It's really easy to attach to the characters this time. It's not light background story anymore, it has grip to it.\nSince it was pretty long movie, the phase was perfectly build. Storyline was great.\nNo more nice superheroes, we need to see that details fight, great job.\nCan't put enough words, movie worth each of second of ur time.", "This is a movie for the die hard fans.": "I saw Joss Whedon's Justice League the first day it came out in theathers. At time I was super excited and hyped. But upon on conclusion the movie just diddn't do it for me at all. It felt choppy, rushed, and not as much action as I would of expected.This film is the polar opposite of that film. From the insights to the back storys of some of the heros to the better explaination of the premise. This film is hardly ever bereft of any details. It also was much grittier and action packed then the other film which was more then welcomed. The visuals as well although I wasn't huge fan of the 4:3, were graphically improved on and alot better then the predecessor.The only reason I diddn't give a 10 out of 10 had to do with the long runtime. It did get a little tedious at points. To be honest unless you're a hardcoore fan like myself, I can't really see this attracting any new comers.Overall I really liked this film alot and would highly recommend this film to fans or people who were heavily dissapointed by the previous film.", "Best! Best! Best! Restore the snyderverse.": "I was waiting for this movie , even thought that we will never be able to watch it. Snyder is a magician. The justice league that we deserved , we needed we got it. This movie is almost 4hours long but man it was worth it. It was dark , intense , powerful and true. The character developments were great , story was too good but yeah it was also flawed in some things but is there anything in this world that isn't. I think this is by far the best superhero movie , dc never created their universe in movies like marvel did , after watching endgame and infinity war I thought that now these are best superhero movies of all time and it just can't be bested but zack snyder proved me wrong and I couldn't be happier. If still WB are'nt gonna restore the snyderverse god they need help. And i must say we should boycott if snyderverse isn't gonna be back into existence after this. Even after 4 hours i wanted more. This is true dc universe. Support #restorethesnyderverse its all in our hands now. I dont rate movies and tv shows this high but we need to support it and it was also worth it. We want more.", "Infinity War after a Few Drinks": "There are some very great things about the movie. We get to learn more about characters that were kind of in the background before - the flash and the cyborg. Also, the colors of the movie were amazing. This movie extended the DCEU and was 100% better than the last one. But was it good? Well, here we can argue.First of all, there were so many things happening that didn't need to happen and so many things that were left unexplained. For example, why did Bruce decide to assemble a team without a treat? I have titled this review \"infinity war after a few drinks\" because there were so many similarities between this movie and the last two Marvel Avengers movies. For instance, the time travel thing that was a little bit unexplained here. The ancient power that needed its pieces to be reunited so that the bad guy can do his thing. The big bad guy that kind of looked like Thanos first sending his minions (the big one being with an axe) to do his job. Cyborg who for some reason was made to act a lot like Vision. The scenes and places constantly changing but chaotically. The movie ending with a speech prerecorded by a dead father. Next villain being teased as someone who is angry at the rich guy with the tech (basically half of Marvel villains just have a problem with Tony Stark) and then uniting with the hero to save the timeline (here I refer to Deadpool). The similarities were so many. And yes, I understand the scenes were shot before Endgame and Infinity war came out, but with a little editing I don't believe the resemblance would have been so uncanny.In addition, Arthur and Diana were there but also - not really helping that much. Especially Arthur. Which is sad considering he has become the DC movie fans favorite superhero. And... Superman... what exactly did he do? Why did they need him when Barry was the one who saved the day with the help of the Cyborg.Also, I don't know how I feel about Amber Heard appearing in the movie. And the music was kind of weird at times.Overall, it was a movie I enjoyed watching although at times I couldn't understand why some scenes needed to be THAT long. Definitely an upgrade and a much needed movie in this pandemic. We miss superheroes, but maybe not these ones.", "Best Zack Snyder Movie !?": "Zack Snyder Justice League !!!Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best-made and most successful DC films without a shadow of a doubt, thanks again to His Highness Zack Snyder. The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do.", "I don't understand the hype for it at all": "Maybe the problem is that I've watched this movie for the third time including watching the previous version two times. But it was quite boring for me and I prefer the previous version by far. Maybe the problem for me is that it is way too long! 4 hours? Are you kidding me?? The movie could easely be shortened to 3 hours in my opinion as there are a lot of lengthy and unnecessary scenes.I also hated the picture ratio and some scenes felt \"cringe\" to me. Probably for trying too hard like for example the girl power scene in Avengers: Endgame.", "Continue the Snyderverse": "Better in so many ways. I'm so glad this version made it. Sure it has a few problems but it's by far superior. I wish to see Snyder get the chance to continue his vision.", "How was this ever let to go to waste.": "Firstly I am completely astonished that whoever oversaw the first cut ever allowed it to make it to the screens. The 2017 version literally destroyed the whole franchise, losing key cast members and ultimately public support.Thankfully there was some who petitioned for the Snyder Cut and I have to thank them greatly. Although not perfect, This is a huge improvement and like most left me wanting more. The problem with the first film was it was just a mess and even though this film has added a huge amount of content taking it to 4 hours it really doesn't feel like that. I'm glad to see that the reshoots didn't make it into this movie as it doesn't fit this cinematic universe and whilst it worked for the Avengers it didn't work in the first movie.The film works well and adds clarity to the character bios, as well as giving each character a real input and reason to be there. Worth a watch deffo, I won't go any further as I don't want to give any spoilers.", "Just Go for it , you will love it.": "Just enjoy the beautiful storyline and the world build by Zack Snyder, his storytelling is just perfect.", "This is worthy of our favorite DC heroes": "This film should be the only and true version of Justice League. A redemption for DC is still possible and I hope they see how well received it is and continue with this path and Zack Snyder, he deserves it!", "Marvel Fan Boy LOVES This": "I'm a marvel fan boy and I loved this cut. The original Justice League was laughable and flat out embarrassing. This new cut has incredible story telling and extended versions of the original that should have been there from the beginning. I also loved the 4 hour length of the movie. The only flaw I have is not in the script or the story telling but the CGI is a little off and some other things Starting with the CGI characters like wonder woman kicking someone sends them back way to fast. Also when characters like Steppenwolf jump or swim it is a little fast for his size. One other very small thing I didn't like was the repeated use of the same song every time Wonder Woman enters the scene. I loved it the first time but did not like the repeated use. Overall incredible movie and probably the best in the DC universe. This movie could compare with almost every marvel movie except infinity war and endgame. Let's hope DC continues on this path. Best of luck DCEU fans <3.", "This was worth it!!!": "The other version of this movie didn't provide character development or true understand how Superman returned... THIS 4 hour movie did it with grayscale tone effect throughout the movie.please have this director return.", "Much better than the original": "It was very long but I enjoyed every minute of it!", "Worth the wait!": "Hats of to all concerned, a truly remarkable film. Bit too much slow mo for my liking but great to see the story finally delivered as it should have been.", "The vision it should have been": "This is not the Snyder movie, but his \"cut\" of it, and ultimately it still shows.Had Snyder been allowed to fulfil his original vision, this saga could have been a defining moment in the DC universe. Instead, he was left with an awful first product and the dregs on the cutting room floor as a backbone.However, what he has done is use that backbone to reshoot, develop and cut a fine, character driven story that surpasses the Whedon version is every way possible. It is astonishing what he's managed to do.BUT! As much as I loved it, and while the 4hrs is a absolute joy and no chore whatsoever, this is still NOT the movie(s) Snyder would have made had the studio not been so driven to reproduce Marvel's Avengers. Which makes it an altogether more bitter pill to swallow when we know we are unlikely to see where he would have taken us next.Still, a solid 7.5/10, rounded up to an 8 for the sheer brilliance in doing what he did to make this what it is.", "This is a great movie !!": "Zach Snyder's Justice League is a fantastic superhero movie. This version had everything we fans expected from the Justice League movie and was so much better than the earlier release.\nThe 4 hours flew by and the character development, action sequences, and overall story was excellent. So glad this was released and gotta say DC is back.\nSo many great parts ... Really liked getting Superman back again, the Flash scenes were really played out to highlight his speed, and loved Darkseid in this version.\nGreat job Zach ... Justice League was awesome !!", "ZACK'S VERSION IS SO MUCH BETTER": "Oh shit, you guys! This makes look Justice League like a garbage. What! This is totally different movie. The only problem I have with this are the slow motion scenes! Ou myy, why so many slow motion scenes. It's so ridiculous and unnecessary. But the rest is so good. Still think that Aquaman is the best DC movie but this version Justice League is up there right next to it.", "This is what justice league was meant to be.": "This isn't even comparable with the theatrical justice league. For a start, I thought only some scenes would change, but this is a completely new movie, its amazing what they have done in the time they had. The whole look and feel of the movie is far better, its gritty as it should be, instead of the stupid light-hearted wannabe mcu that it had previously.The characters where far far far better...each character had a part to play, their own story and plenty of action scenes. I'm actually amazed the lack of superman in this movie and it made it so much better, the previous version was only superman which left no room for other characters to develop, he was too overpowered and stole everyone's time. Cyborg...oh my, they really went into depth with him and created a likeable and struggled character. Batman was batman, he played a small role overall but was really strong in the final half, especially with the epilogue. Aquaman was kind of just there, being aquaman. Wonder woman was actually disappointing, besides her immense power she didn't do much and all her action scenes had a stupid soundtrack with bad cgi.Oh, the villain...great. Steppenwolf actually plays a part in the movie, he isn't a stupid blob with no purpose of reasoning for his actions. He has a great backstory and motives. Darkseid was also good, I'm glad he made an appearance although his entrance scene made him seem weak.I'm so happy that they let Zack see his vision for this movie through, it's glorious. The length of the movie is a bit much, but no time is wasted, even when setting it up for future movies which actually got me hyped. DC, stop messing around, let this movie influence you, be original and stop copying marvel. 9/10 :0", "A Historical Event Rather Than A Movie": "A brief history of The Snyder Cut of Justice League;\nEver since Zack Snyder left the movie due to a family tragedy in early 2017, only months before the planned release of the movie in November of that year, Joss Whedon was brought on-board by Warner Brothers to essentially make a movie exactly as the studio wanted it to be. Which was a lot more brightly coloured, more humour, lighter mood instead of the dark theme that Man of Steel and Batman v Superman set for this universe. But most importantly, a maximum of 2 hours run time. Which is laughable when you need to introduce (from scratch) 3 main heroes, a main villain, and resurrect a previously deceased hero... It's literally TOO MUCH for 2 hours. Which the 2017 Theatrical Cut of \"Josstice League\" as some call it, proves, as it is so rushed from scene to scene...Luckily, there were many, and I mean loads, of fans out there who were willing to go extreme lengths to get Warner Brothers to release a Director's Cut of the film, called \"The Snyder Cut\". They started a movement, made fan-cuts of the film, put up billboard in cities, put up banners at comic-con, wrote letters to the studio explaining how good this Director's cut would be...Zack Snyder meanwhile, was teasing fans with concept arts that are vastly different to the 2017 Theatrical Cut.I for one, was really routing for this cut to come out, but it seemed like it would never become a reality, sadly.Then; in early 2020, rumours were going around (a lot) about there being a very good chance that this \"Snyder Cut\" might actually come out, and in March of that year, it was officially confirmed that it is happening!\nI was blown away, and shocked that it will actually become a reality, where Zack, who loves his work on these DC Comics adaptations, would be able to bring his original vision to life, for all of us to see!\nMy spoiler-free review;\nThis 4-hour epic is more of an event rather than a film. Although it feel like a 2 and 1/2 hour film when you watch it, it doesn't drag at any point...If you like superhero movies (not just for stuff blowing up every 5 minutes) you'll adore this film! It has such a good story driven core with plenty of humour, which actually works, unlike in the 2017 Cut, well written characters, plenty of fan service filled action, as well as for the average sci-fi/superhero loving movie goer!I'd recommend at least watching Batman v Superman first, at least, if not Man of Steel too before that, to fully appreciate this masterpiece!I'd give this an 9/10.Some may find the highly irregular aspect ratio weird (1:33:1 or 4:3) which is the same aspect ratio used for full IMAX screens, but also older TV shows, which will be odd to watch at home, as it will result in black bars on the left and right of the screen, as opposed to top and bottom, like with regular cinematic widescreen displayed on a home TV (16:9).The main changes to point out, compared to 2017's (Josstice League) Cut:An extra 2 hours of runtime.All the characters now have proper introductions and back stories.Colours aren't super saturated, so they look more suited to this darker themed universe.Steppenwolf is actually menacing, to look at, and as a character.Scenes aren't rushed.The score (by Junkie XL) is very suiting.We see more of the main villain(s) behind the scenes.We see our heroes at their peak performance.The villains and their minions are menacing, as opposed to throw-away TV show villains.A lot of heavy spoiler stuff I don't want to mention!\nAnd finally, I'd like to thank the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement for getting this movie released, as it should have been from day one!\nI regret not being apart of it unfortunately, all I can do now, is pay to see this movie, which I did, and thank the people who made it happen.And thank you Zack Snyder, for making one of the best superhero movies, ever made!", "To many fan boys": "I'm wondering what other movies are watched by those giving this one a ten rating.\nIs it better than the first version, yes, slightly.\nIs it a cinematic marvel of epic proportions, No.\nis it a masterpiece with original story, No.\nis the cinematography groundbreaking and unbelievable, No.\nis the acting so enthralling, you're captivated can't separate actor from character, No. (it's not even the best acting most of these performers have done).\nSo why is it so highly rated. My only guess is those DC fans, who love these characters, who then in turn were so disappointed with the first version and desperate for all to be well again. They are clinging to the notion this film is all they ever wanted rather than reviewing it honestly.\nStill not a patch on any of the Bale Batman movies. Lacking in the fun and enjoyment of Aquaman. Four hours and still underwhelmed.", "A masterpiece in superhero cinema": "First I'll address the low votes. Every single one is written by someone who believes they are the biggest movie buff to ever walk the earth. What redundancies are you speaking of? Every added cut scene and small segment is what builds this amazing piece of work. Are you that mad it ran 4 hours?Now for the movie itself, what a pleasure to watch. The character arcs and development of The Flash and Cyborg are fantastic, much needed context for this movie. It's great to see what the initial story was, because now I understand how much Wheedon destroyed this vision. Anyone that says a movie like End Game outweighs this is blind, easily disputed purely off any scene without fighting. So much is left to be assumed in Marvel, where here we are graced with excellent dialogue and no cookie cutter story development. Yes it does have some faults, but I can confidently say this is a top 2 superhero movie.", "Now to continue with more": "This was fantastic. I liked the original but this was a million times better.

Most of the original scenes and plot lines were replaced, and our heros are allowed to fully develop. You gain emotional attachment to everyone at the end, even the villain.I want to see it in IMAX. My 55 inch screen doesn't do it justice. Snyder set up the plot for a second invasion with multiple timelines. It just begs for sequels.Warner Bros execs are fools if they waste the opportunity for a wide theatrical release. Justice League can a become a tent pole property on par with Avengers.Just make it shorter next time. The first hour is mostly ridiculous and a waste of time. The story only gets interesting after the Flash shows up.And please stop it with the fake reviews in throwaway accounts.

I watched this yesterday and I can promise you it didn't look like 4hrs. When you are actually drawn by the story time just flies by. I actually wanted more. And this is coming from a guy who grew up on comics, loving both Marvel and DC movies for what they are in the end- Entertainment. (Please everyone should put the DC vs Marvel movies to bed everyone.

I understand some people can't forgive the flaws, but the more I personally think about the overall impact they have on the overall final result, the less I'm bothered by themI'm so glad I was given the opportunity to see this movie, and I hope Warner Brothers will allow Zack to continue his story.", "Incredible film!": "Well let's get 'the essentials' out of the way first: 4 hours of Gal Gadot is not enough! There.I could not believe how much more there is to this story over the \"original\" version. This film goes way beyond anything close to a \"comic book\" from my recollection (somewhere back in 1950's to 1970's). Here is as real a story, with such incredible depth, that I hope, it will define this genre for a very long time.Yes, I grew up reading the comic books; and Thank The Film-makers for a story that is NOT another 'Origin Story'. Fans, like me, already KNOW all of that -- and really appreciate a story that goes beyond and has depth.I STILL miss GL though. (For some, GL == Green Lantern) the dialog included, at one point \"well, there are no Lanterns here...\" -- so perhaps there is hope. Yes, I know, the one GL film appears to have bombed -- but not for me.I agree with others here that the DC universe is now equal to the Marvel Universe; providing Marvel bring back Robert Downey J. == Iron Man; but I digress.At the end of the film, they have certainly laid the foundation for many films to come; and I hope they stick to the plans they made here.Conclusion: WOW!", "A superior version; although it's not without its flaws": "The film's plot centers on Batman gathering allies to fight an incoming threat. The premise and the overall concept of the plot is not different from the original film, but apart from that everything else is different. Snyder cut may have the same premise as the original but it actually cannot be said to be the same movie. In fact, watching both versions would garner the same opinion: Snyder cut is a different movie and a far better one. In terms of the plot, characterization, and overall presentation this film is vastly superior. The stories of each characters are more detailed, as well as their reason for being in the story makes more sense. To that end it makes the audiences feel more connection to these characters because they were more fleshed out. The film centers on an ensemble cast with more or less equal importance to the plot. Even Steppenwolf, the villain of the film is given depth that despite being a henchman to greater threat is someone that the audiences could relate to. Every set pieces of the film makes sense both to those that were established by its prequels and to its supposed sequels. The film moves at a slow pace, but all the more reason that its climax pays off especially to those who watched it straight. Despite being a better version, Snyder cut still has a few flaws in it. One of them primarily is its long runtime of 4 hours. The film is worth 2 films. Its long runtime is also caused by Snyder's casual use of slow motion. While it does add a lot to the visual experience, perhaps they could have trimmed it down to ones that are most essential to the story. Another issue is the overall presentation of the main heroes. Unlike MCU which dedicated at least one film per hero prior to their unity in The Avengers, Snyder cut and the original version suffers from presenting all the characters right there (with the exception of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman). Because of it, many of the characters' backstories were only presented there. Another main issue is the overall story. While again the story has more sense and tension than the original version, it still ends somewhat in a cliffhanger. It certainly sets up many plot points that could be picked up in sequels, however, there is no guarantee of a sequel coming and therefore resolution to these possible plot points and the main one may not even come.On the whole, from a visual standpoint, Snyder cut is indeed an eye candy. The stunning visuals, the crisp cinematography and accompanying musical score are worth it. From a narrative standpoint, it feels like it is only the tip of the iceberg that was presented. Despite the films flaws and long runtime most especially, this one deserves to be watched.", "The movie we should have gotten": "Watching this everything make sense unlike the one we got !", "#RestoretheSnyderVerse": "This movie have a lot of potencial for more movies and characters development, we hope font be wasted.", "Thank you Zack Snyder": "There is not much to say..

I hope the team stays United!#ReleasethesnyderverseFor Autumn x", "ZACK SNYDER PULLS JUSTICE LEAGUE OUT OF THE TOILET": "I sat and watched all 4.02 Hours of this movie, it for a lack of a better word is: SENSATIONAL, The way three separate movies were used to put together a Master Piece of the Metahumans and Batman Super Hero movie to date. This is the movie that should have been released in 2017 when Warner Media/DC Comics pushed the Trash called Justice League out of the door and into theaters.The movie is craft fully done, it told a story and made it exciting to follow along, it cut out the useless scenes that had no bearing and filled the screen with action, excitements and thrills, it made you wish the movie was 2 hour longer.You don't have to pick this movie apart, it's nearly perfect as is and a joy to just sit and watch a movie made for the centuries., so sit back, dim the lights and enjoy for the next 4.02 hours a master piece in movie making.", "So close to perfection...": "Despite the fact that this is of an exponentially higher calibre than its theatrical predecessor - containing outstandingly skilled craftsmanship & from a technical perspective, marvellous filmmaking that elevates the material tenfold - I'm unfortunately still irked by the fact that it's somewhat mired by a jarring, superfluous ending that arguably defeats the whole point of the entire #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement - because this wasn't Zack Snyder's original cut of Justice League... Which is what I personally wanted to see when offering my support / watching.To be specific, admirers of Zack Snyder's DCEU petitioned Warner Bros to provide him with an opportunity to finish the version of the project he'd already completed filming in 2016 (to honour his creativity / reinstate the artistic integrity of his film which had been compromised) - so to see him shoe-horn in a distracting, aesthetically cheap looking knightmare scene he hadn't filmed during the production's initial phase of principal photography - that was recently shot last year in 2020 / lensed by himself (failing to visually coalesce with the cinematography of Fabian Wagner) kinda felt counterproductive - especially considering the fact that it didn't transition effectively from the original conclusion (Lex's yacht) to the new inferior alternative (gimmicky fly past the camera).From interviews released today, it just seems as though because Snyder knew he wouldn't be able to complete the planned JL trilogy - likening it to the 1st film in the Lord of The Rings saga - he (presumably, in an act of desperation) chose to try & cram bits from the 2nd & 3rd installments (Green Lantern, The Joker, Knightmare foreshadowing, Martian Manhunter) in to the first... For the sake of at least featuring them to please the fans. Now this is simply my opinion but although I appreciate the goodness of his intentions, if Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings trilogy had been cancelled after the launching feature, I'd have preferred for him to just make the best possible adaptation of the 1st novel (Fellowship of The Ring) as he could've; I wouldn't however have supported him if he chose to use Snyder's approach, inexplicably including random, contrived excerpts from \"Return of The King\" or \"The Two Towers\", added with the sole intention of strong-arming the studio in to a possible reconsideration of investment. Thus, to me, the first iteration of \"Justice League\" alone is sufficient enough to warrant a sequel & a filmmaker like Zack should have believed in his product enough - to have confidence in the fact that other films could've been commissioned based off of its impressive standard - without any unhelpful extras glued on to the rest. Witnessing him rely on needless baiting (Jared Leto's Clown Prince, Deathstroke, Mera, Martian Manhunter) is just so sad & completely unnecessary because it contributes nothing to the plot & is there to remind us of what could've been... But we're already acutely aware of what a missed opportunity this was - reneging on the 2 sequels - so what was the genuine point? All it does is detract from what we had - a remarkable film that should've been completed & then left alone without tampering.As for Martian Manhunter, his troublesome inclusion should've been omitted in its entirety from the cut. The Flash, Cyborg & Aquaman's introductions are thoroughly engaging & clearly establish their characters, motivations & dynamics as part of the team etc. Enhancing the narrative by enriching the story with their powers / individuality / presence amongst the group. On the other hand, Martian Manhunter's reveal fails to provide him with any semblance of a personality (we've no idea who he is, what he stands for) & moreover, the first appearance rescinds vital character development for Martha & Lois - after their truly evocative & powerful exchange in Amy Adam's character's flat. It feels lazily constructed, devoid of any perceivable sense of effort & it's barely thought through, to say the least. Illogical. Like I said, instead of patiently waiting for a sequel to organically introduce him like everybody else, without the luxury of that security, Snyder just throws him in to a pair of brief, underdeveloped sequences in the hopes that this will suffice... And taking in to account just how forced & unnatural the two are, they don't & I'd rather he hadn't because if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well. Leave him for later.Regarding the rest of the film, we can finally mention the innumerable great assets: character focused drama, strong characterisation, phenomenal world building, decent performances, coherent filmmaking, well edited / constructed sequences with thematic pay-offs & satisfactory conclusions, complimented by an astonishing score from Junkie XL that enhances the tension throughout, phenomenal fight choreography, lensed in beautiful frames thanks to the gorgeous cinematography / camera work from the incomparable director of photography, Fabian Wagner - polished during post with sublime colour grading.The villain Steppenwolf also benefits from the much needed development & is therefore, thankfully fleshed out, complex & even more surprisingly, seriously threatening, as are his henchmen, the Parademons - shockingly fearsome & intimidating creatures for the heroes to fight against - that are far more purposeful, well utilised & harder to kill than typical redshirt nemeses, making Marvel's Chitauri look positively useless by comparison... Though Henry Cavill's Superman weirdly becomes a deus ex machina, solving the problems & saving the day (as he did in 2017's, though less elegantly) with underwhelmingly relative ease. I had hoped Steppenwolf & Kal-El would clash in a fearsome battle which could've rivalled his fights against Zod or Doomsday but on the contrary, after multiple set pieces that depicted the opponent's durability & relentlessness, upon the arrival of the titular Kryptonian, the alien was suddenly reduced to a harmless, defenceless punching bag & the risk he posed to the league was subsequently diminished. He became less of a danger & more a victim of circumstance, being endangered. Hence, although this typifies the strength of Superman, it does make his compatriots look questionably weaker - since they had difficulty fighting him on numerous occasions, whereas he didn't. Plus, you come to the realisation that the story would've been solved after the first confrontation, had Superman been alive... Which is admittedly the point the creators are trying to make but it subsequently portrays the rest as somewhat over reliant & underpowered, something Batman may be but a member like Wonder Woman certainly isn't - & it subsequently impacts the stakes negatively.Oddly, it's never really shown where the Parademons go by the end of the movie either; one of a few very minor plot holes; their unexplained disappearance. Secondly, another gripe pertains to a question I had when the team confront Steppenwolf in the Metropolis labs - why doesn't the Flash simply speed up in order to try & steal the 3rd mother box from Steppenwolf's grip before he teleports away? Surely then - with the weapon still in the protagonist's possession, the crisis would theoretically be averted? Moreover, Darkseid unwisely opens a portal before the Mother Boxes explode so presumably, his home planet must consequently perish & he must also die, being caught up in the blast radius of the detonation too?Despite my complaints, contrary to what people may infer from my review, I did honestly enjoy myself thoroughly from beginning to (the original) end & would wholeheartedly recommend everyone gives this a watch, as it's worthy of the time / investment... My major frustrations are simply borne from the knowledge that had these issues been addressed, it would've unquestioningly been a 10/10 & utter movie perfection. They came so, SO close to crafting something remarkably faultless but to quote Lex from BvS: \"you flew too close to the sun\".Funnily enough, in respect to the history of \"Justice League\", I've no idea what Warner Bros were thinking when they involved themselves in the development of this in 2017; I saw nothing whatsoever that could be considered \"risky\" enough to warrant any kind of studio intervention. It's the most broadly appealing film Zack Snyder's ever made in his career; 3 hours & 30 minutes of pure, cinematic entertainment.Irrespective of my critiques, do go see it - just stop playing once it reaches more problematic reshoots - because we've had enough of those after Joss Whedon. No more, I beg of Zack.", "this movie is a good reason why every director needs his own cut": "After seeing the movie, zack deserved his cut since the first time. I am happy i was one of the fans asking for this.the movie hage hig stakes, every actor is at his best, and you enjoy the action.because takes time to focus in every character, and the drama works, it deserve the 10.I have seen two versions of another movies, and the director cut always make the movie better, you always get more scenes when the drama and the action is better.so i just want to thank everybody who worked in this movie and to say that because is a long movie, i watch this from time to time, and never gets boring.in fact after this movie i wanna see more about the old batman ben affleck plays, and more about cavill superman,and i want more directors get their cut.to me, more scenes is better, because you understand better why someone is angry or happy at some point. In fact, it i was a director my own movies would be nearly 3 hours, maybe, because i like scenes when characters are presented, then scenes when a trouble is introduced, and then the resolution takes time to be resolved.and saying this, yes, some theorically long movies will have better rating because i have seen alot of better extended cuts of another movies too.Maybe is because i am the only one in my family who loved movies since i was a child, or that people always ask me wich movie is better to watch, is that i have watched alot, and i want to keep watching all my life.it never feels boring.", "CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10)": "The stage curtains open ...When I first heard that this was coming out, I have to admit that I shrugged it off with indifference. Then I saw that it was 4 hours long, twice as long as the theatrical release, and that got my attention. I knew that this wasn't just a director's cut with a few snippets of missing footage here and there. This wasn't even going to be the same movie. It was going to be completely different.The effects of Superman's death sent shock waves around the globe, in fact, throughout the universe, impacting everyone in one way or another. In the wake of his death, sinister forces were awakened and the threat of human extinction hung over everyone on the planet. Our story starts with Batman recruiting warriors for a special team, a league to thwart the impending attack. Joining the team are Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg ... and maybe even the Man of Steel himself. Six against overwhelming odds. Six ... with room for more.Zach Snyder's Justice League is darker, grittier and better developed. The plot is completely different from the theatrical release with additional characters and pivotal points. Even Steppenwolf's face in this version is different, more evil and sinister looking. Each character is given a comprehensive backstory that explains so much more, and adds very nicely to the overall story. The flow and pacing of this film is seamless and smooth, not choppy like the first one. You go into nothing blind - even at 4 hours long, it is just as it should be.This comes at a high recommend. Even if you haven't seen the first one, this is a must-see, can't-miss movie. It rivals, in my opinion, the final two Avengers movies and it leaves the gate wide open for a sequel. I have the seen the first film, and this one tops it, hands down. This gets a very strong 9 stars out of 10 from me with the hope that a sequel is soon in coming.", "Someone Owes me 30 bucks": "I want a refund for the garbage justice league they released instead of this! Awesome movie now. Even with the 4:3 ratio.", "It's not perfect": "This movie is far from perfect, but it's still a great movie. It's a big improvement on the Whedon version. But almost everything that are added to (or technically removed from) this film is amazing. The awful mustache removal doesn't exist here. And this extended cut of its own can even rival to the lord of the rings extended. Though not nearly as good.One of the pleasant surprises of these film was the reveal if the Martian man hunter and A big improved Letto Joker witch in suicide squad was the worst thing.The biggest problem was that it was a little bit too long.", "Incredible": "This should have been the movie released on 2017. There si no comparison.", "Far Far Better Than Justice League 2017": "I Am Here to ensure you that You should Watch this movie even if you are not a DC fan.\nZack Snyder is James Cameron of DC.\nGal Gadot Is Love Herny is best As Always", "#SnyderCut": "Zack Snyder You Are Amazing For Making This Masterpiece! The Snyder Cut Was Great and Would Watch Again!", "What it should have been": "This is what it should have been. The premise was the same yet done so much better. Plenty of new scenes and the character intro's were different. Storyline continuations prepped. More fleshed out characters. Each character had a journey. More emotion. Less forced one liners. Darker and more brutal. Huge improvement. They have to make a sequel now, in this style, dark, gritty and with emotion. Just avoid the alternate timeline dreams if they do another one.", "JUSTICE DELIVERED": "The movie justifies it's long run time with the elevation of characters and in depth story. It was supposed to be the DC's canon back in 2017 but that's ok.Zack Snyder has given fans what they wanted.", "The Real Justice League Motion Picture.": "At the beginning I thought that the four hours will be too much with a lot speech between different characters, but fortunately I was wrong. The film is much better than its predecessor. With almost the same dialogues and main scenes, there's more action, suspense and drama in it, with the participation of important DC's characters that make it in a bigger superhero movie. I know and I understand why it didn't prevail and become in the first, but Zack Snyder had found the right way and someone didn't allow him to take it. It's a shame because it would have been the best rise for DC's universe.", "Justice League: Pros, Cons and Mixed Thoughts": "Even though this movie isn't perfect and has lots of problems, I'm glad fans can finally get some closure and for Snyder to publish his version of the movie. Now with that said:Pros: Batman and Superman are the best of the main characters. I love their arc and the actors give a fantastic performance. The CGI is good. The cinematography is gorgeous. The action scenes are also really good. Alfred, Lois and Martha are also really good. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is alright as well. The third act is awesome and I love Darkseid's inclusion. The slow scenes where the characters are just talking and bonding are great. Also it ends in a way that makes you want more.Cons: Ezra Miller's Flash is terrible. His dialogue, acting and specially the running. The 4:3 ratio is distracting. The songs used throughout the movie are also really bad (I loved \"Everybody Knows\" in the original cut I think it fit than any other soundtrack used here). Martian Manhunter's inclusion adds nothing to the story. Actually lots of scenes served no purpose to the overall story. The slow motion is way overused. The pacing is too slow specially in the first and second act. None of the emotional bits hit me. The comedy also didn't work. Most of what I talked about here comes down to the writing which leaves something to be desired. The R Rating is completely unnecessary. Lots of curse words could have been cut and the blood could have been trimmed down. Also Zack has this thing with having his main heroes kill people in his movies: Batman in BvS, Superman in MOS and Wonder Woman here. You could justify Superman killing Zod and maybe Batman, but Wonder Woman would have found a way not to kill those bank robbers.Mixed Bag: Wonder Woman has some great scenes and some scenes where the acting could be better (\"Kal-El No\" comes to mind). Aquaman completely lacks the charm from his solo movie, but gives a solid performance. Junkie XL's soundtrack is sometimes epic, sometimes unnecessary. The black suit is okay. It's not bad, but I would rather have seen Clark use the blue and red. Jared Leto's Joker starts out intriguing when he shows up but the scene takes way too longer.Overall: Not bad, but not great either. The runtime is completely unnecessary and lots of scene serve no overall purpose to the plot, but it's enjoyable. Better than the theatrical version, Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad but nowhere near as good as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam and Batman v Superman: Extended Cut.", "Massively Overhyped": "I do not care if you disagree but for me it was massively overhyped - the first 60 minutes was mostly boring though did have some lively moments. Can I point out CGI is pretty awful, 4:3 ratio like what is the point of that.This is a movie for fanboys it does not merit a score of 10 but they were always going to vote this movie high.4 hours of this movie is far too long and there is too much stocking filler that could have been removed.I don't think it is a film I could watch again", "One of the BEST Superhero Movies Ever": "For anyone who has never been a big fan of superhero movies before watching this, after watching this one, you will change your mind. This movie is very powerful and intense. It starts off by drawing the audience in, using very detailed visual techniques and effects within certain moments in the plot. And, these neat little visual tricks foreshadowed events to come throughout the movie. It definitely helped advance the plot, and made it more intriguing. The story is very engaging too, and it's easy to follow. And even though there were a few moments when I thought they could do a little more as far as dialogue and character development in certain scenes, they really made up for those plot holes with the mesmerizing and positively over-the-top visuals; and despite being a very long movie, it was such a plot driven, visually intoxicating experience, that made it feel so much shorter. The stunningly mindblowing visual effects and cinematic artistry is really what made this movie what it is. But, there is also an emotional experience to be appreciated here too. I think I may have even shed a tear a few times myself. And, if just in case you were wondering..it is DEFINITELY worth 4 hours of your time, and watching in one sitting, however, I will warn viewers that you may spend a great deal of time thinking about the movie afterwards. It's THAT good.", "It's a work of art": "The teaser, trailer, the teasers for every individual characters - all of them were already giving it the look of something legendary. And the final product was exactly that. Every single scene is so visually satisfying to watch, the characters are all given a proper background, the scenes have enough breathing space which ended up padding the runtime, and the best part - it's better than the 2017 version. It's a good thing that it was released in a 4:3 ratio, as it helps to see the parts of the frame that are normally removed in theatrical cuts.People normally say they have a problem with this movie being 4 hours long. I actually like it this way. If I have paid for a movie I should get the entertainment for the movie. I don't want my entertainment to finish in just 2 hours. The only time I'd not prefer it is if the movie feels like a drag to look at, which this one definitely isn't. It's so visually satisfying and has so many pleasant scenes that I didn't even remember blinking for 4 hours. It looks like a painting being brought to life. This is what happens when a professional photographer and painter becomes a director. Each scene could be turned into a comic book panel. This is not something we normally get to see in superhero movies.Previously I never cared about Cyborg. For me he was just one of those three random characters thrown at the face, the other two being Aquaman and Flash. I knew Flash because of Justice League and Cyborg because of Teen Titans, but it was finally in this movie that all three characters have been given a proper arc. They were given a reason as to why they behave the way they do. Now Cyborg is my favourite character from the entire movie. His character development is the most impactful and his superpowers make him look far more superior.The only problem I had was with the ending. The Knightmare and Martian Manhunter cameo scenes were not needed. Martian Manhunter had been established in the Martha and Lois scene, while the Knightmare scene didn't add much except the fact that there will be a sequel, something that the other scenes were also already mentioning so it seemed pointless.I like this movie a lot. And I mean literally a lot. Ever since I have watched this movie I often watch videos on how different it was from the 2017 one, and the changes are immense. This has now become my favourite superhero movie. I hope WB gets over its ego and continues this story. It looks like a masterpiece compared to what we have been fed all our lives in the name of superhero movies (there are exceptions of course, like The Dark Knight and Sam Raimi trilogy).", "WELL WORTH THE WAIT": "From director Zack Snyder who was earlier denied this opportunity to showcase his masterpiece has finally find it's due. Due to his personal loss he had to step away from the project under post production status but He created something which all the movie goers and DC fans alike wanted to see and longed for. Now after millions of Hashtags and protests of Fans WB has finally listened to the reason and even provided an extra 70 million for the same.And OMG, what a satisfying wait it has proved to be. Mr Zack has knocked it out of the park with it's 4 hr runtime which WB earlier didn't seem necessary and were trying to keep up with MARVEL. This movie is satisfying on so many levels (I am a huge DC fan btw).The movie takes it's time in building characters and giving audiences something to care about each JL character and more. Every character has been fleshed out to quite an extent which only adds to the cohesive story telling which were missing earlier in the theatrical cut. The visuals have improved drastically ( There goes the extra budget ) and the majority of the scenes here are showcased in day light (mostly) which has helped increase the Viewing experience for everyone. The tone of the movie has been Snyder's all around starting from MOS AND BVS which gives the fans something to cheer about.It's suffice to say that Snyderverse be restored now. This was the movie he promised us to deliver and what we deserve. There has to be more in this saga which ends on a cliffhanger and creates more room for at least 2 more JL movies.This is an epitome of a movie and should appeal to all the movie fans out there alike (Both of Marvel and DC). It's a slam on the face of the naysayers and everyone who ever doubted Zack.PS: LONG LIVE DC \ud83d\ude0e", "One of the most beautiful DC movies, Comic Book movies and best moves ever.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a must watch movie for all comic book fans even if you're not a huge DC fan. I'd rank this as my 2nd favorite DC movie of all time and my all time favorite DCEU movie. The film follows the same plot as the God awful 2017 movie by Joss Whedon, where the Justice League unite to stop Steppenwolf from conquering the world. Only this time, this movie fixes all the mistakes that were wrong with the 2017 garbage. Theres more character development, especially with Cyborg and the Flash, there are longer action sequences and much better acting and writing in general. One big scene was Wonder Woman stopping the terrorists at the beginning of the movie, also watching Superman appear in a black suit was the biggest highlight. The biggest strength is Snyder's vision. He wanted this to be a big comic book movie that keeps fan excited for more DC content just like his work on Man of Steel and BVS: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition). Even though this movie is 4 hours, you will not regret it and might want to rewatch it again immediately. Go watch the Snyder Cut as soon as possible.", "A great claim": "A great claim.\nA hero movie that wonderfully blends drama, action, and adventure.\nIt's about how Batman decides to recruit people with super powers to defend the earth from impending attack while protecting powerful cubes.\nIt is the reissue of the previous Justice League movie.\nFully better explained, thing by thing, it would be the last straw that not after 4 hours of duration.\nHe takes the time to develop each of the characters.\nGood performances.\nQuality.\nEntertaining\nIn chapters as if it were a book.\nSome effects are not fully achieved and others are, all characteristic of DC.\nWith crazy and incongruous moments.\nNice Sunday.\nIt leaves the window open for the sequel.", "An absolutely DCEU feast.": "Being a dccomics fan, always wanting to see what darkseid looks like, and to me, Zack Snyder's Justice League did an absolutely fantastic job nailing it. Not to mention the entire team, Justice League united yet to fight darkseid and his army is whole dceu thing. There is no other director as visionary as, as dccomics nerd as, as wanting to give fans what they want as zack snyder. I literally watched it as many times as i couldn't even remember it. I would really want to get ZSJL 2&3, hope we get it \ud83e\udd1e", "Epic Adventure": "This is what Justice League is supposed to be, zack Snyder released a flawless movie! DC needs to keep it going!", "It's bigger. It's longer. It's a movie filled with the typical Snyder extravaganza. And it's a much better movie than I expected.": "I was neither for nor against the Snyder cut of Justice League. In fact I was very agnostic on whether or not such movie even existed. Man of Steel was an ok film in my book, and one critics perhaps are too polarized with. Batman vs. Superman was visually astounding but I did have problems with the pacing of the storyline and the terrible ex-machina in the form of \"Martha\". I don't hate nor worship Zach Snyder blindly. He does try to make good films and to his credit, he is very good with the cinematography at the very least. So I was very surprised to see what a huge improvement his version of Justice League was over the 2017 version produced by Joss Whedon.It still suffers from similar pacing problems as Batman v. Superman such as Superman and Batman instantly becoming friends after just one film where they almost killed each other. I found the inciting incident when Superman's screams activate the motherbox a bit convoluted, even for comic book logic. And to be honest, I wasn't really digging Wonder Woman's new soundtrack because it felt a bit over the top.Despite all of this, there are many more good things I greatly enjoyed about this film. Cyborg and Flash's character arcs are much better fleshed out. I especially liked Cyborg's development throughout the film who slowly begins accepting his new life. Ray Fisher's chemistry with Joe Morton (who plays Cyborg's father) is the icing on the cake that makes Cyborg an even more appealing character. The Flash delivers genuine comic relief throughout the movie instead of simply acting as the laughing stock as in the 2017 version. Aquaman is also better depicted and we get a glimpse at ihs reluctance to become the titular charcater he eventually becomes. Junkie XL's music (which I enjoyed in BvS) was refreshing. Deathstroke's, Lex's, Martian Manhunter's, and especially Joker's cameos were a nice touch in the film. Lex Luthor is way more conniving than wackie, which is what Lex should've been in BvS. Jared Leto's Joker is a big improvement over Suicide Squad. Making General Lennix as Martian Manhunter was not too far fetched after seeing David Harewood's similar character arc as the Martian himself in Supergirl. Joe Manganiello as Deathstroke was a welcoming addition to the DCEU and what could potentially be for the rest of the DCEU should Zach Snyder want or gets the chance to continue bulding what he started.This movie may have been 4 hours long but they don't drag on at all. This movie was every bit as exciting and engaging as Avengers :Endgame even if it lasts one more hour than the former. I still believe Snyder should've taken his time building the characters instead of simply cramming multiple in just two films. But this movie nevertheless blew my expectations. It's entertaining, it's very enjoyable. Superman's return to the world of the living was more authentic and way less ridiculous than the expensive CGI mustache removal we saw 4 years ago. And this movie admittedly has left me craving for more to come from the DCEU.", "JUSTICE LEAGUE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN \ud83d\udcaf\u2728": "A must watch for everybody !! Zack Snyder had a vision and now it is concrete that whatever vision he had just needed some trust and time and the end result would have turned out just like this amazing superhero movie !", "A Better Film Doesn't Equal A Great Film": "It's way better than the original mess that was shown in cinemas a few years back. That doesn't make it a great film. Whilst motivations and characters get their chance to shine it's still a slow plodding exposition heavy cartoon. It seems some fans are bumping this up way higher than it deserves to be based purely on them being fans, or perhaps all they require is a coherent story to think a film is amazing? Who knows. It's an ok watch, just don't get caught up in the blind hype and you won't have your expectations ruined.", "Spectacular DC Action": "But that Joker laugh tho. It finally came, a better look at how bat, spear lady, fast boy, robot boy with father issues, and supe came together to fight against the unity of three mother boxes and save the world.So the longest movie ever made was 21 hours long, and this director's cut was a fifth of that length. Since I didn't remember much about Justice League (for good reason), I didn't know much about what Snyder added or fixed.The first two hours retold the assemble of the five heroes, as well as showing parts of the characters' backstories. My biggest issue was that the pacing was a bit slow. Also, cyborg's CGI was noticeably bad at times. His speech sometimes didn't match his lips moving.The most entertaining aspect of the movie was for sure the action. There were multiple fight scenes, and all were handled very well with awesome CGI. The villain Steppenwolf's armor looked slick and he had a strong presence. With more action, there were more blood and violence, which gave the movie the R rating. This didn't really impact the action much.The best action came from Wonder Woman, Berry Allen, and Superman. Gal Gadot probably had the most fighting and bullet shielding, and she was so great as the Amazonian. For Allen, even though his suit wasn't the cleanest, he still showed how dope he was when he ran at the speed of light and discharging electricity.A noticeable aspect of the movie was that even though there was a lot of action, the movie looked bleak with little color throughout. This is not so surprising as most of DC movies are the same. But for 4 hours straight was something else.Overall, I had a fun time and appreciate Zack and his crew's effort at making Justice League more exciting and action-packed. Definitely watch it, but be prepared to seat for 4 hours straight. 8.5/10", "Cold, emotionless spectacle": "Following Superman's death, an ancient cosmic evil has awoken and has the Earth in its sights. Again. In atonement for his misjudged vendetta against Superman, Batman tries to build a team to face the impending threat.The story of the ill-fated Justice League movie is well documented, as is the tale of Zack Snyder's return to the project to complete it in accordance with how he saw it initially. So is it an improvement? Was it worth it?I have to start by saying that I do not worship at the Church of Snyder. I acknowledge that he is without peer at putting amazing visuals on screen, but there is something in his overall approach (and I have seen most, if not all, of his output) which I find vaguely distasteful. And, like others, I really dislike his darkening of the DC universe. It seems to me that he sees being dark, grim and unpleasant as being more important than being fun and entertaining.The original Justice League movie tried to tone down the darkness and add some fun. While not a complete disaster, it failed to reconcile the disparate tones. This lengthier take on the same material does not suffer from tonal inconsistency - it is unquestionably Snyder's movie.That means that it is heavy on unnecessary slow motion, and it carries some unnecessary profanity. It is grim and dark, and often pretty violent.It is, however, far more coherent than its predecessor, it fills in some much-missed backstory (and also some bits of backstory which are completely unnecessary and which go nowhere), and it is visually amazing.But it is cold and emotionless. I'm a DC boy. I have no emotional connection to Marvel characters per se, but the MCU movies have been extremely emotional. Conversely, I have always had an emotional connection to DC's characters, yet this movie left me completely unmoved. I enjoyed it - hey, it's the Justice League, kind of, and Superman is much closer to the Superman I expect - but I never cared in the slightest.", "Wasn't sure if it was worth rewatching, I was wrong!": "I honestly believe it would be the exact same movie with a few extra scenes. It was more than that. Everything is way, way better. The subtle changes to backdrops, dialogue and score make this version so much better. The plot seems way more cohesive. I really felt underwhelmed by the original. That version just seemed to jump from scene to scene without any direction or explanations, and jumps to cheesy catch phrases that almost seemed irrelevant. After watching this version, I'm hoping for a sequel. I highly recommend you watch this, especially if you felt underwhelmed and let down the first time around.", "Wooow!!!!": "The Snyder Cut is great! It is a complete new movie.", "This will leave YOU restore faith in DC universe movies. Not kidding.": "Zack Snyder's definitive director's cut of 3 years old \"Justice League\" is finally here. Determined to make sure Superman's ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne aligns forces with Wonder Woman to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions, but this time Cyborg is the heart of the movie. Now over 4 hours long and with a 4:3 screen ratio, we get a truly different experience. It looks different, it feels so much better, and with all the eye-candy and actual characters, you will feel the emotions of losing the DC universe the way we did.

It played like the editing room had been replaced by Zach Snyder's ego.Half of what makes a movie great is what gets cut. Snyder basically cut nothing. Watching this was like watching a first year film student's script where everything was explained and everything was included and nothing was left to the audiences imagination.The first one wasn't great.

It was just as bad as the first in some areas, worse even, and in some area better. This had less story than the original, at least pertaining to the world after Superman. The cgi in fight scenes was awful. Wonder Woman's movements look so glitchy because of the rate they sped them up or maybe stitched the scenes together. It looked like frames were just removed. There wasn't a smooth flow in her movements. I'm glad they cut out that pathetic scene where Aquaman leaps backwards in the original. That scene was so lame. This added some new stuff that was just so boring and made no sense. Why did we need the singing? The music is easily the worst part of this movie, from random characters singing to an awful soundtrack that makes absolutely no sense and leaves you saying with is this music?! It's like Zack Snyder had to make stuff up just to cram a lot into this to pretend it's a completely different movie because he added so much time. He added some pointless filler, that's about all. Ben Affleck was less loathsome in this version, so that's a plus. Zack Snyder sure loves sexualizing Gal Gadot with more revealing outfits, garish bright lipstick that makes her look hard, and filming shots from sleazy angles of her in battle. It cheapens her character. They should've let the woman who made Wonder Woman remake this one. She knows how to make a film. This was overrated and overhyped. It was boring to sit through. So much filler. The scene where Barry meets Iris and he stares at her as she's about to die awkwardly instead of just saving her while that horrible music plays, was just so stupid. Also, Barry going barefoot and busting through a door. Maybe they should've watched the much loved CW version for ideas. This movie had so many problems. I honestly don't get the 10 star ratings. Some of the CGI was as bad as the Quidditch Scenes in Sorcerer's Stone. Jared Leto is the worst Joker of all time. He sounds like he's imitating Jim Carrey and is just pathetic and lame. I don't see the appeal of that \"actor\" tbb. This movie wasn't all bad though. Some action scenes were good. The old gods scene was great. This movie improved by the ending. I just wish all the stuff in the beginning hadn't weighed the movie down. I think they should've had a couple viewings to gage responses and make changes. That would've saved this movie and let it be epic. Also, why give Amber Heard more screen time? Pay attention, she sucks as an actress, no one likes her because she's an awful person. She should've had a diminished role and maybe even been killed off in this version. That would've been the best thing to do. Before anyone accuses me of being Team Marvel or whatever...I'm not team anything. I have kids who can appreciate all Superheroes, whether DC or Marvel. We have our favorites from both sides. DC just needs to better represent them though. Better scripts, better story, better actors (Ben Affleck...worst Batman ever...worst than Clooney even, Amber Heard...worst person ever). This is long, but so is the movie and I was left disappointed.", "Just wow. Finish the Snyderverse.": "Right off the bat, I am not a DC fan, but I enjoy comic/superhero movies.

If you do a poll immediately after this comes out, I guess that this film would win the \"best DCEU movie\" vote. But over time, just like anything, I wonder how it would hold up. Even after having watched this 4-hour extravaganza, I personally still think that Man of Steel and Wonder Woman are the 2 best movies of the universe and even that's not saying a lot as both of those movies have major problems. But I could say that Snyder's JL is most definitely better than the original 2017 Justice League, yet it took a LOT just to make it basically only a little better. But the thing is that I honestly barely remember anything from the 2017 movie other than it was a pile of crap, so improving on crap isn't very difficult and I suspect that anything that Snyder pumped out was going to get automatic praise because hardcore comic book fans are desperate to have something in the DCEU they can claim to be a masterpiece. And the recent Wonder Woman 1984 is so awful and insulting that ANYTHING that came after it was going to look like a masterpiece by comparison.The problems that I have with Snyder's JL cut is the same set of issues that I have with a lot of modern day superhero films: too much CGI, cringe dialogue, forgettable music, and flat characters. These modern heroes just pose, scowl and stare trying to look intimidating to the backdrop of green screens and forgettable music. Remember the amazing scores from Richard Donner's Superman and Tim Burton's Batman that still make the heart race today and as soon as you hear them you know what movie it is? I literally just saw Snyder's JL, could hear a piece of music from it on the same day that I watched it and completely forget. It was basically some lady doing nonstop opera voice for 4 hours. EVERY scene had this opera lady's babbling in the background! Music should fit the mood of the scene, not permeate the entire film.Then there's the CGI. Call me an old fogey, but I'd much rather re-watch real-looking sets and backdrops made with a lot of human care, like Tim Burton's Batman movies or Chris Nolan's Batman Begins, over these CGI-fests where even most of the people aren't even real. It's literally like watching a live-action cartoon. And for the characters that actually are played by real people, the actors all seem so bland and interchangeable, despite being vastly different looking in appearance. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but despite the double the length running time, doesn't this cut still have a lot of the SAME dialogue from the original 2017 version?Cyborg gets a lot more screen time, but it's just a lot more screen time of him being a dullard. Flash is still goofy and don't get me started on that overly long sequence where he stares lovingly at the barely attractive Iris West. She ain't that good lookin, dude. Plus, that scene is a painful reminder of the horrendous TV version of Iris, who's tainted every future version of that character for me. You could cast the great Viola Davis in that role and I'd still hate the character just based on the name only. Aquaman just does a bunch of posing and grunting trying to look cool. And Wonder Woman? I liked the original movie, but after WW84 and this movie, I get less and less enamored with Gal Gadot. She's a horrible actress and her version of Wonder Woman just sticks out her chest and does that posing thing like the fashion model she really is. And her accent is starting to grate on my nerves. The great Jeremy Irons, an actor of true gravitas and personality, is stuck in the thankless role of Alfred spending all his time being and awe of and enamored with this collection hollow millenials, when they should be in awe of him.I was so unimpressed with the original JL movie that I can barely remember what is actually new and extra in this one, other than dragging out scenes in slow motion, the expanded backstory on Cyborg, and the appearance of Jared Leto's Joker. So instead of Diana taking 5 minutes to thwart the terrorist heist, she takes 30 minutes! All the while doing a bunch of mugging and posing for the camera and slowing around doing stupid, showboaty stuff instead of getting to the point. Like why didn't she drop down directly on the terrorist ringleader to stop him BEFORE he started unloading his machine gun on everyone? Or maybe since she can apparently superspeed now, just speed over to him and knock down the gun instead of showing off her speed by stopping bullets? Any one of those bullets could have got by her and killed an innocent, but instead she goes the difficult route. You had a similar scene of Barry Allen where he actually takes the time to steal hot dogs in the middle of a saving Iris. Then there's some filler scene of Cyborg breaking the law so that some random single mother wins the lottery, when there's a ton of people in the world who need help. Just blandness on top of blandness.On the plus side, I actually still like Ben Affleck's version of Bruce Wayne/Batman, though. People think of him as a bad actor, but this is arguably one of his best roles and he's been hitting it out of the park acting-wise in the last decade with major achievements like The Town, Argo, and Gone Girl. He just been stuck in really bad DCEU movies like BvS and these JL movies. I also like the Lois-Martha subplot with a couple of other real actors in Amy Adams and Diane Lane bringing depth to the proceedings. Henry Cavill is lucky to have limited screen time in this due to the main plot being about reviving Superman/Clark so the JL can battle the main villain, some silly looking alien being made of pins and needles. I literally can't even remember the main antagonist's name from a 4 hour movie that I just saw. That right there says it all! I got through this bloated thing once and that's enough for me. There are actually people who are going to re-watch this movie many times and to them I say, good luck. Apparently, this crap is the new normal when it comes to superhero movies for modern day fans. More power to you. I'll just gladly stay stuck in the past.", "OMG! Snyder just saved the DC Universe": "Can somebody please explain how the same director could create two completely different movies??? Four hours but well worth it. This is the Justice League I was hoping for. Very very good and I hope the producers take note and stop with all the campiness. They gave WW real edge and great action in this movie and eliminated all of silly head nods and winks. It's a shame because WW1984 suffered from the same hokey schtick. This was the first DC movie that will truly compete with Marvel. It's about freaking time!!! Great job!!", "I'm Shocked": "So... I have been very dissapointed by the DCEU and how it has progressed. Man Of Steel is not my cup of tea (Altough I have warmed up to like it more and more) BvS is a beautiful mess with TONS of writing issues. Wonder Woman was GOOD but ruined by the ending. Aquaman is FUN but COMPLETELY jarring in tone and execution in the larger context of the universe. Shazaam is really good but again feels like its own thing.Josstice League is one of the worst things I have ever seen snd I was sceptical to say the least when they announced that the Snyder Cut was going to release. \"Same plot, same crappy villian, same hollow characters. What's the point?\"But my curiosity exceeded my doubts. I watched it... And watched it again, snf then one more time and I have realized that I. WAS. WRONG. Justice League is one of my favorite CB movies ever made. And I am BLOWN AWAY.Let's get the negatives out of the way forst because let's be honest. It's not perfect. It's LONG and the first third is a bit slow and overstays its welcome. The music is sometimes really on the nose, and doesn't really fit. The CGI is kinda bad sometimes, the action (like in most ZS movies) is a bit... much. And yeah the movie drags a bit.Beyond that it has GREAT character moments between Bruce and Alfred. Between Bruce and Diana, between Diana and Arthur. And it's always sincere. They feel like PEOPLE and the plot doesn't get in the way of the characters ever.Steppenwolf went from a cringy, generic \"bad guy\" to a BADASS, damaged warrior with ACTUAL motivation. Dude just wants to go home and redeem himself of past mistakes. They made a good choice eith his eyes, they convey desperation and fear of Darkseid even tvo he's a big brooding monster.Cyborg is such a gpod character that it PISSES ME OFF at how much his character suffered in The Whedon Cut. Best character in the movie by fat. Same with Flash. Guy went from a pathetic coward who's \"big moment\" was pushing a truck to saving the entire world.The ending got the biggest update. We see them ACTUALLY working together, using combo moves and EVERYONE has a thing they meed to do in order to win. It was really satisfying to see.Not gonna day more than: I loved this Movie snd I want more.", "The superhero movie we've been waiting for.": "Despite the odds, Mr. Snyder really delivered something special with his cut of Justice League. This film far and away is the best superhero film I've seen and I hope the studio can find a way to see the rest of the directors vision through to further sequels. 10\u2b50/10\u2b50 will rewatch at least 100-500 more times and I urge anyone reading this to do the same. #restorethesnyderverse", "The World needs Heroes": "I loved this version, this is the Complete version.

Think of the Past, CGI help improve the movie.No CGI no DC no Marvel movies, forget it.And at last Cyborg got the Justice for the character - this is the right Thing and the best Thing about the movie.The real Justice League movie is this one.Thank you Zack Snyder.", "Everything makes sense now": "I watched this in HDR on an OLED TV.Everything fits now. The story is solid. The characters balanced. Cinematography is amazing. The color grading and dark scenes. Wow. It's a completely different movie. Even the length of the movie didn't felt long. This is my first 10 ever, because the movie did put itself in a different league and out of appreciation Snyder and his team found the energy to do this for us.", "For Autumn": "#restorethesnyderverseThis is Cinema at its best. The amount of love & speculation this movie is going to blow the minds of the executives at WB's. Inspite of watching the theatrical mess of a movie that the previous justice league was made into, which essentially had the same plot & a lot of same scenes in it, Zack Snyder's Justice League will have no problem winning hearts. This just felt like a 4 hour masterpiece. True artistic vision coming to life. Such an inspirational & a heartfelt movie. An experience in itself. The fan base cannot be credited enough for giving the world this gift. For the Snyder family, For Autumn.\nAnd to imagine if the director had been given full control during the shoot of movie, we would've been watching a bearded superman with a mullet & a couple of green lanterns in the movie, which according to me were the only things missing aspects from this insane epic. There is going to be a massive demand to continue this story forward and the fans would hope it comes to life once again.#restorethesnyderverse", "Clearly the brass at Warner Bros have no idea what they are doing. Zack Snyder's Justice League.": "There is information in here that SOME people may deem to be plot details (spoilers), I do not believe that is the case, however, take heed.So a lot of people are aware of the saga that was Justice League. Long story short: in 2016 Zack Snyder sought to make a Justice League movie that would bring together the DCEU heroes from his own Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, as well Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman. After having completed photography and editing on the film, the director underwent a devastating family tragedy at which point WB decided to, instead of pressing pause on the production, remove Zack Snyder from the movie, bring in Joss Whedon to reshoot and rewrite almost the whole damn thing and curtail the movie down to two hours. It was a super colossal disaster. A devastating mess of epic proportions, 2017s Justice League was a financial tragedy as well as ostracized by critics and fans alike. The studio had the world believing that prior to Whedon's involvement, the original version of Justice League was an unwatchable mess and only brought in a new director in order salvage what was entirely unwatchable and god-awful in order to delivery \"something\" resembling a movie to theatres. Fine fair enough, I guess.In 2021, however, we know better now don't we? Is Zack Snyder's JL a better movie than the theatrical release? Yes. Far and away this is a better movie, both in terms of storyline as well as craftsmanship. IS ZSJL a cool movie in its own right? It is. I am a weird freak, and so I got a kick out of Man of Steel as well as Batman V. Superman, flaws and all. The truth is that if you like enjoyed Snyder's DCEU, Wonder Woman, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, then you'll like this. If you gasped in terror at those movies, well then you're not going to like Justice League either. It's all fruit from the same tree. However........ I found myself asking \"WHY IN THE HELL did they even bother getting another director to reshoot the movie?\" Let me explain without getting into plot details:This is, on a fundamental level, THE SAME movie as the theatrical release. There is A LOT more in here yes, it is bloodier, has more foul language and mercifully it is shot on film, however the overall plot points are the same. Superman is dead, Batman is going on a mission to gather the team, Batman goes to recruit Aquaman and Barry Allen, Diana goes after Cyborg, Steppenwolf shows up to steal mother boxes and raise hell, the League gathers together to resurrect Superman, Superman comes back and is kind of crazy, the League has a fight with Superman, Superman takes off with Lois, the League goes to Russia to deal with Steppenwolf by themselves only to get their asses handed to them, Superman shows up, kicks Steppenwolf's ass and saves the day, Bruce buys the bank that held the mortgage to Mrs. Kent's farm and here we are. That is the GENERAL plot of the 2017 movie and that is the GENERAL plot of the HBOMAX movie. Yes, the 2021 version is far and away better in every imaginable way, but the overall story arch is the same. So why in THE HELL did they have to bring in another director to screw around with everything? A kid with an iPad Pro could easily edit this four hour epic down to two hours in an afternoon.At this point it is clear that the leadership at WB have no idea what they are doing. The company is being run people, ostensibly, who have no clue about the movie business. They may be \"business people\", but they certainly do not know anything about filmmaking. My recommendation is that if you have a free afternoon or evening watch this movie. Do yourself a favour and forget that the 2017 version even exists.", "We Live in a Society Where This Is a Beloved Movie": "I got a chance to see this film before most others thanks to the fact that I won the Heroes Among Us Sweepstakes by putting up a video of myself talking about how much I love my mom, and comparing her to Wonder Woman in the way that she is one of my heroes. So, last night, my family and I got the chance to sit down and watch all two-hundred-and-forty two minutes of this amazing film. The film is truly epic from beginning to end, and it did not let up in its action or its many twists and turns. The story is actually given time to be truly complex, going from character and revealing their current predicaments and feelings as the events unfold. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and even though it was a four-hour film, it went by so quickly. The cast helps this story greatly, with the performances of Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, and Ezra Miller as the main heroes being three-dimensional and emotional, and the rest of their cast, like Hinds as main antagonist Steppenwolf, Amy Adams and Diane Lane as Lois Lane and Martha Kent, respectively, Jeremy Irons as Alfred, and Ray Porter as secondary antagonist Darkseid. The visuals have greatly improved over the theatrical version, where nearly ninety percent of the film was reshot after Snyder had to step away due to a family tragedy, and they are awe-inspiring, with characters like Cyborg, Steppenwolf, and Darkseid looking extremely real and as good or even better than some of Marvel's visuals. The score by Junkie XL (credited as Tom Holkenborg) is truly a Mount Everest of scores, as he described himself. It contains the epic moments, the emotional moments, the dark moments, and the happy moments, and improves each and every scene, with all the character themes and the \"Foundation\" themes being my favorites (more on that in the next few days). And finally, the direction is just great. Zack directed every scene with a well-thought plan, and it fits every scene, from the action to the tragic, exactly as it should be. In conclusion, after waiting nearly four years for Zack's true vision of the film, everything has worked in his favor, and this film is truly amazing. As hard it is to believe, this has surpassed Avengers: Endgame as my top comic book film, and I can't wait to watch it again once it hits HBO Max! Thank you, Zack Snyder, and everyone else who made this a reality!

One of the most pretentious things I've ever seen.", "Now That's JUSTICE LEAGUE!!!": "Watching the ZSJL, it's clear that Zack Snyder has the vision and the whole story arc to make this. While the 2017 JW+GJ JL was making an expensive TV movie without any plan while throwing the blame to ZS.The story arcs become clear and personally I want more.", "Outstanding, Captivating, Comprehensive": "I thought this film would be boring and drag on and on... but no... fantastic story telling, both in dialogue/narrative form, and in visual form. 4 hours just slipped by and now I am wondering if I ought to watch it again! And I am not much of a super hero movie fan! Excellent!", "same movie as 2017 just with cut scenes restored": "Just with some cut scenes restored. So why was this not released originally, so they can squeeze more money out of the public. With the cut scenes restored the movie is over 4 hours long and rather boring in most parts because everyone has already seen the original, so all anyone is seeing for the first time are the cut scenes from the original. They could have easily included this version on the DVD of the original version. Talk about recycling a movie. As a matter of fact most movies with restored cut scenes or alternate versions of the same movie are usually included in the original DVD. So why was it not done here for the original DVD release in 2017 ? Get more money out of you. Not many movies are worth watching for 4 hours including this one.", "Definitely worth a watch.": "I quite enjoyed the first movie so had high hopes for this one and overall it didn't disappoint.It didn't really need to be so long and the first hour really dragged with some really unnecessary scenes (singing as Aquaman swims away was painful) but really gets going when Superman arrives(Best bit of the first movie also).The back stories where great on the whole and the bad guys were pretty decent.The action scenes were well represented especially Batman's.I'd recommend this movie(unlike Wonder woman 1984 which was terrible) but be prepared to drift for the first hour.", "Better Doesn't Mean Good": "Quick disclaimer, I haven't watched the Whedon cut all the way through because why bother with that garbage? I've seen clips and that was enough to know it was terrible and irredeemable and not worth watching. So I can't technically say that I know Snyder's Cut is better, but from all that I do know and can tell it does appear to be a drastic improvement. That, however, doesn't mean it's a good or great movie.I enjoyed Snyder's cut of BvS, I'd give it a 7.5 I think. And I'd give Man of Steel either a 6.5 or a 7, I thought it was good but a bit boring. This? I'd have to give a 5.5 on a good day. Despite it being over 4 hours long it was still not fully explained, the runtime was wasted on pointless moments and subplots that didn't go anywhere, the plot was silly and lacked sense at times and the acting/casting was mediocre at best.Batman - as we saw in BvS - is a haunted man who has let his darker side get the best of him; at the end of BvS we do see him turn a page back to a more hopeful version of himself but not like this. In this movie he wasn't even the same character, he lacked any depth or character development that made him remotely interesting in the last film. They also make Batman a fairly useless character whose only purpose in the film is to bring the gang together but he doesn't actually personally accomplish anything.Wonder Woman/Superman - Both fine, but neither are great. Gal Gadot isn't going to be winning as best actress Oscar anytime soon and Cavill wasn't given any screen time to do anything other than snarl and smirk; hard to properly review that.Cyborg/The Flash - Don't like the casting on these guys. Cyborg really could have benefited from having a solo film prior to this as his story seemed interesting but even in the bloated runtime was merely touched upon and glosses over. The actor wasn't great, but wasn't awful. The Flash is a waste of runtime. Awful jokes, bad acting, and he doesn't accomplish one useful thing toward the plot other than generating electricity which could have easily been written out. He leads some civilians out of the lair only for them to need to be saved by Cyborg anyway. He helps WW catch her sword which only would have landed a few feet away from her anyway. He doesn't matter at all to anything that happens in the entire movie.Plot:\nSteppenwolf is sent to Earth to redeem himself after previously failing Darkseid; he goes to Earth to collect the \"Mother Boxes\" but is surprised to find out that Earth is the world where Darkseid previously was defeated and lost the Mother Boxes? What? Where else did you think you were?When Darkseid comes to Earth the first time he promptly has his ass beaten by Zeus and Aries - where's Aries now? Why doesn't the just beat his ass again? It seemed pretty easy the first time.The Amazons, the Atlantians, and the Earthlings (but not Zeus or Aries?) each take a cube to protect and hide. The Amazons put there's in a secret maximum security vault. The Antlantians take there's and put in in a secure maximum security prison. The Earthlings? Oh, the bury it 3 feet under ground. Cool cool.Overall, honestly it wasn't an awful movie; I've certainly seen much worse and you have to give a little leeway to Comic Book movies and rate them on their own scale (except for The Dark Knight, Logan, and Joker which are actually legitimately great films) and so I can't say this was bad compared to some. But in the end, it was just another movie about a big CGI baddie trying to collect cubes to rule the Galaxy/world/whatever. The only difference was this one was 4 hours long and asked you to take it seriously. But it didn't ever once earn the respect required for me to indulge in a 4-hour runtime like some art house films do.I like Zack Snyder, I really do. I enjoy 300 and Sucker Punch especially. But this wasn't his best work, just being honest. MoS and BvS were much better films and earned much less praise. If everyone were being honest with themselves they would admit that if Whedon had never had his cut and this (or a condensed 3-hour version) was the version we got in 2017 no one would be saying anything close to what they are now. I doubt it would have been catastrophic enough to have the \"Snyderverse\" cancelled, but it wouldn't have set the world on fire either. And frankly, even now it should NOT be enough to bring back the Snyderverse, it doesn't deserve it. Let it die. Let Snyder move on to other things, better things.", "What a difference!": "I am one of the millions who hated the 2017 Justice League, I thought it was boring, cheesy, and didn't fit the DCEU at all. The characters were all over the place, and were completely different from their previous movies. And to be truthful, I wasn't expecting this to be great either - better yes, but not great. But I was wrong. This is a brilliant movie, not only because of the achievment, but because it is directed better, acted better, written better and is an all around superior movie.Like all Zack Snyder movies, this is a visual masterpiece, I am not talking about the CGI, that is a different matter, I'm mean how stunning it looks. There are scenes that look like they were painted, it looked amazing. The CGI, does look good, not amazing. You can spot from obvious effects here and there, but not bad enough to take you out of the film.The R rating helps the movie alot, since there are some graphic fight scenes, especially the ones involving Steppenwolf. The music is amazing here too, with some scores coming back from previous movies. But the biggest standout from this version, has to be Cyborg.I didn't care much for his character in the 2017 garbage, but here, he's an entirely new character. Everything about him is 100 times better. There is a scene which involves a single mother, and it is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Why did they cut that? The action is amazing here, and you really feel the power of our heroes and villians, combine that with Zack's vision, the music, and you have a worthy sequel that we should have seen to begin with.There is a few issues I have with the movie, one being the aspect ratio. It took me about 30 minutes or so for me to get used to it, I don't really know why they chose this. The runtime can be a bit much for some people, so most are better to watch it over the course of 2 days or so.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a great superhero movie, and I am so glad that Warner Brothers seen the error of their ways and gave us a chance to see Zack's true vision. I bet he feels amazing knowing that this was given to us to see, and this movie will go down in history, not for its quality, but for its meaning.9/10", "A well deserved two stars above the original version and well worth the 4hrs.": "I was really movie resistant at first and it took me a few days to get around to finally watching it, but after reading mixed reviews who were in majority positive. I sat down and got ready and watched a whole 4hr movie. All I can really state is, I'm absolutely glad I did. I mean it was that much better than the original theatrical version. So much so that I would of liked another 30mins or and hour more. So, to be left wanting for more after already watching a 4hr version means a lot. Therefore I highly recommend watching the Snyder cut version, it's not a 4hr waste of time. Get your popcorn, soda, M&M ready and turn off your phones and just enjoy the movie.", "Superman and Batman work very well": "This movie masterpiece and mind blowing fantastic story screen play better than 2017 justice League.", "Hype, HYPE , HYPE": "What's the hype here?!\nNew Story?! New Villain?!\nIt was just an extended cut of the original movie, putting some animations in between and Bruce's dreaming won't make this better, but I agree it was at least way better than original movie which was a disaster.", "A Well Crafted Story with Incredible Visuals": "I am not going to bash on Joss Whedon, he is an extremely creative individual that has created some amazing stories, movies, and entertainment. He most likely was brought in at the 11th hour to try and get a movie out by the holidays, and was under a mountain of studio demands, after Zack Snyder had to step away because of the extremely unfortunate death of his daughter.That being said, the 2017 version was not a very good movie. This version is what we should have gotten back in 2017. Yes, it is long, and yes they cover a lot of material, but the length of the film gives the subject matter time to be fleshed out. Not once during the 4 hour runtime, did I feel it lagged at any point or was boring. So much more was explained, the story actually made sense this time around. It is abundantly clear what Zack was building here, and where he was taking the story. The extra film time also allows for the character development to be much stronger. If you aren't going to do solo movies first, you need time to introduce these characters, otherwise only your extreme comic book fans will care. Zack Snyder's Justice League does that, we get characters who we understand, and plot lines that make sense.Am I a fan of everything in the movie? No. I read the inspirations for almost all of these stories as a kid and teenager. The death and return of Superman is one of the biggest events in comic book history. That story deserved to have it's own movie(s) dedicated to it, not shoehorned into the end of one movie and jammed into the plot of the next. But in the grande scheme of things, that is only one complaint about a movie I enjoyed.I'll say it right here, people. We will never get another director who does shot-for-shot scenes that look like they were pulled right off of the comic book page. These movies are visually striking. Zack has an incredible talent and attention to detail to make this happen. The guy is a truly gifted artist and creator in this sense. I've watched BvS multiple times, not because I particularly enjoy the story, it's extremely busy and too cramped for liking, I feel like too much is going on. It probably should have been at least 2 movies, probably 3. But the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.I sincerely hope this movie re-release is successful and leads to a \"Justice League 2\" with Zack at the helm. The setup he has done with this film is remarkable and leaves the viewer anticipating what is coming next. And on a strictly emotional note, it was really great that he was able to finish this after his family tragedy, and given the resources to do so by the studio. Even if I had not enjoyed the film, I would have been happy that he was able to release his version.", "Really Great, forget the preview version": "This has absolutely nothing to do with the theatrical version. All makes finally sense and I didn't get the feeling of being fooled.\nI'm so glad the final battle has been remade that way, it's more epic and we get the Flash doing something other than joking around.\nLoved the ending with the dream and the special appearance. I really hope it means something for the DCU to come.", "BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!": "After watching this, I'm really trying to understand what went wrong in 2017.\nJoss Whedon completely changed the movie.\nThis Snyder Cut is so satisfying and it is waay waaaaay better than the 2017 version.\nI loved almost everything about this cut.\nThe tone, the Batman, Flash, Cyborg arc, the visuals, the way Steppenwolf was in this movie and the action was 10x better.Everything that felt rushed is being explained in this movie and it shows!!!This actually felt like a Justice League movie.

I had enjoyed Man of Steel and actually really enjoyed Batman v Superman (especially the Ultimate edition which I recently discovered), even though so many people seemed against it. I loved how it played with the political and theological implications for humanity. So as would be expected, I was pretty excited for the Justice League film. When I watched Zack Snyder's version I was not at all disappointed. The length wasn't an issue, in fact it gave me enough time to truly commit and become involved in it. I admit, I'm one of those strange people that actually enjoys being able to sit through a long movie if it manages to invest you into the world it creates - I can happily sit and watch all LOTR extended edition films from start to finish.The soundtrack is great. The visuals are exciting and other-worldly. From the moment that the epic opening scene begins I became obsessed - the beautiful music as the camera pans accross the mountains, only moments after bringing us back to the end of the last movie, taking a careful moment to look at Lois Lane.Honestly, I loved it so much.The ONLY reason I couldn't give it a 10 is because of a couple moments where the CGI just really stuck out to me and distracted me. It's odd too, given how on point the visuals are for almost the entire movie bar a couple exceptions. (This is just me being very pernickety)Those little details certainly don't stop the movie being a masterpiece that I will enjoy for many years. I am resolved to now buy the entire collection of the \"trilogy\" and hope that Snyder can continue his vision and creat the 5 story arc that I'm sure would wow us all.", "It's actually sort of four hours of ok": "I was tired of of the super hero loop 15 years ago. Marvel movies have done just as much to kill movie theaters as COVID-19 because unless you were making a Avengers tie-in, your move likely would never be made. DC took the bait too. The OG Justice League movie was a real pile of you-now-what. I hated it. DC has been gifted so many rich characters and they were all trashed.Marvel can't tell a story to save their lives. It's all mime. Thor is Superman. Quicksilver is The Flash. Iron Man is Batman. Tony Stark is Bruce Wayne.Thanos is Darkseid. It goes on and on. But DC didn't respect the history and power of their own characters and chased the money of mystery box of the week marvel scams to a absolute dumpster fire of Justice League with Whedon's reboot.I was a skeptic of all skeptics because I think the only good movie Zack Snyder has made was Man of Steel. A lot of that was in the tone set by Christopher Nolan. But after four hours, even thou this isn't really a 'good; movie, I have to say there are 'good' things in this movie.The Snyder cut has a torrent of good scenes and ideas of a half dozen other movies that didn't get made. This isn't really about a two hour movie expanded to four hours. Snyder's cut is more about 5 movies cut DOWN to four hours.Batman and Superman are basically on cameo status, which is fine as they dominated the previous dour entry. And despite the fact that Chris Terrio's wiring still isn't any good, there's real gains here. Wonder Woman actually instills wonder. The Flash tugs at the heart strings. Most of all Cyborg takes on dimensions of a character we wish we knew more of. Ray Fisher's character is so much more here and could be EVEN MORE if DC got their act together with real writers.So there's some great stuff. There's some real surprises. There's dimensions. But the movie still suffers from it's entire premise of chasing the Avengers.Note to anybody building DC properties into films: Never chase Marvel. The real gold is in front of you. Let your characters breathe because they have the richest stories of all. There's a hint of that here.", "At last a DC film to rival Marvels": "Thank you for making such an incredible film that now makes sense the storylines and characters were so well written and we were able to connect with them!Superb best film I have seen since endgame!", "Watch Once, Probably Never Again": "Man, I didn't really like it:Cyborg was cool. The best actor in this movie came from a guy playing a robot! The irony!Ben Affleck's Batman is the worst! And what's up with the change in his voice? Not intimidating at all. He looked bored in most of his scenes.Wonder Woman is beautiful but my god when she was narrating I thought is she a native English speaker or what?Flash ... smh. This guy will lead the Flash Paradox movie? He's ok in the film, but, kind of corny. By the way the black girl he saved is hot don't you think?Aquaman? To the actor that plays him, please stick with the writers and director of the Aquaman movie. PLEASE.Steppenwolf is possibly the worst villain ever in a comic book movie. Just a waste. Darkseid could've been better if he had more screen time.Hey Warner Brothers, please hire the writers of the Justice League cartoon series and DC animated movies to write the next JL movie.

The plot lines were and cyborg had more character development in this than the theatrical release .how did warner bros cut this off and allow joss whedon do this fu** kery .how did they cut off darkseid .the character designs off Steppenwolf are much better and also no CGI mostache.no awkward flash and wonder woman scene. The story was amazing made scene and probably Zack Snyder best creation .thx for all of you who campaigned for the Snyder cut.", "Bring the Justice League 2 #Snyderverse": "Far better than the 2017 version. Worth the 4 hours!", "The #SnyderCut is like a real life Flashpoint Paradox": "The Justice League movie released in 2017 was rushed and had no character or depth to it; however, Zack Snyder's Justice League rights all of those wrongs.Each hero had more depth added to his/her story, and it was needed and deserved. Among all the heroes, Cyborg/Victor Stone finally had his much awaited time to shine. I appreciated the empathy and emotion surrounding his cybernetic nature which emphasized his compassion for family and humanity.Wonder Woman did not appear to have her fear of being the hero she was destined to be (as she did in all other movie appearances). In other movies, not just the Justice League released in 2017, I felt she was only the hero because she had to be. Then after defeating each villain, she hid and withdrew. I do not find that to be hero like at all. However, here she finally took charge and was the strong Amazon warrior she is meant to be. She appeared to be stronger, faster, more agile, and fearless.Darkseid did not have as much screen time as I had anticipated based on the second trailer. That trailer made it appear that he would have a greater presence in fighting alongside Steppenwolf against a united Justice League. Another disappointing factor about Darkseid is that he was so easily defeated by Earth's defenders the first time he attempted invasion. It would have been more satisfying to see more depth and development to Darkseid as all the other heroes had received.The taller visual ratio 1.43:1 versus the traditional cinematic widescreen ratios was definitely a new experience for me in terms of a major superhero movie. I was not to certain about how I would feel about it; honestly, I would have preferred the cinematic widescreen ratio.The Snyder cut overall was satisfying, and I really hope it sets a better path for future movies in this story and timeline. No pun intended, but I see Zack Snyder's Justice League as a real life Flashpoint Paradox which makes it feel like the original theatrical cut never happened!", "What was the point in any of this?": "My rating is based on the fact that Warner wasted $70 million dollars to reshoot this thing. Why? What's the point?The people who hated Justice League will NOT spend another 4 hours in the DCU to give this another chance, so the only people who will see it are those that didn't absolutely hate Justice League, who also happen to have HBO Max. That's not a ton of people.And what's the end game? Warner will never pony up another hundreds of millions of dollars to make another Snyder DC film, it's just too risky, and this film ends in \"dead ends\" as Affleck is forever out as Batman, as is Leto as The Joker. It's all a waste of time that'll never go anywhere.So why does this even exist, exactly?It's like Warner spent $70 million to make Snyder himself feel better.Aww. I hope it was \"worth it\", Warner.That money might've been better spent donating it to cancer research or something like that, but pumping up a director's ego is also good too, right?Update / Edit: To all those clamoring, WB confirmed today that they are NOT \"restoring the Snyderverse\", confirming this film's complete irrelevancy.Update 2022: Warner execs have stated making this film was \"a mistake\" that cost the company dearly, so much so they have run out of money for the rest of 2022.

Cyborg's story was better only because there was finally enough for it to make sense. But the movie is still too long and boring in spite of all of the action.Overall it's a taste problem, not an artistic one. If you don't have good taste to start with, it doesn't matter how hard you try to make art.The last 10 minutes was such a shocking, vile jolt in tone with the Joker's ridiculous cameo that I don't ever need to see a Snyder cut again in this lifetime.", "Erase Joss Whedon 's Version of the film please.": "That's it.

I have just re-watched the entire marvel universe movies in chronological order and have always been more than a Marvel fan over DC. However, this movie was phenomenal. The character development was exceptional and the movie really allowed you to connect to the other heroes who didn't have their own movies. Flash and Cyborg had depth that you simply didn't see in the first one and you really as connected to them as you did the more familiar heroes. The scenes, the angle sand the use of lighting made the cinematography superb. This movie IMO is the best super hero movie ever made. It is easily one of my top 5 favorite movies all time. I never really understood how important a director is to the success of a movie until I was able to see this side by side. Same plot but a completely different story and vibe.

Justice League Snyder cut was only for rent on 48 hours on Cosmote tv to watch it and I rent it. When I saw it from the moment it begins, my eyes were straight to the screen because it was so epic. And this film is without a doubt, a masterpiece.It opens with Superman screaming during a battle with Batman and Wonder Woman, and the scream goes and far far away. Then the three cubes are turning on and the way is sounding is very awesome, especially in big screen or in hdr tv. The cgi is well fixed in Steppenwolf from the Wedon cut. This time, the flash and Ciborg are showing their own backstories and you tie with them and they take you by the hand to the end harmoniously. The soundtrack is awesome. The action scenes are incredible with an epic feeling from start to finish.This is an dignified, of the highest quality, most epic and entertaining movie. 4 hours long and not get bored of it and it made me want to see enough more on the dceu and it not only saves the dceu but it gives to it personality, meaning and substance.

There's so much in this movie that every re-watch feels like the first time and I love it more and more I see it. The villains of the story had true emotions and had true intentions. Each character feels so lively and amazing, there isn't one point of this movie where I felt it to be bland or boring, and I feel the movie deserves the upmost respect for the hardwork put into it.

Less garbage HAS to be better than more garbage...just sayin'. I've ragged on superhero movies in the past for being joke-fests, but this movie is grim beyond grim. What feeble attempts of humor that are attempted (turning Barry Allen into a cross between Jimmy Fallon and Jerry Lewis) are just painful to watch. And WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE SLOW-MOTION? That alone has to add an hour to the run time! Here's another idea...let's make the movie even MORE depressing by desaturating the color. IMHO, every artistic decision made in the filming of this movie was the wrong one. At this rate, the DC universe will always be a shadow of the MCU. Of course, Disney's working their asses off to make that irrelevant and insufferable too. What's a classic comic lover to do?

I'm not a comic nerd, but I am a film nerd.My eyebrows raised at the 4 hour runtime, but it's easily digestible. The 'chapters' actually help that. It's a cohesive vision and the pacing is really nice.Problems for me personally: The bad guys were pretty bland, and CGI was OK, not sure what to say here. There's a LOT of slo-mo to the point it gets in the way. The 4:3 aspect ratio really pissed me off, but I got used to it. When I read the director's reasoning, I got pissed off again.

I noticed numerous improvements over the joss whedon version, i felt it was right that this version got made in the end. The characters get much more time, cyborg and the flash in particular seemed to really benefit from this. There was more action and the effects were better and more exciting, there were less quips and less humour and some frightening nightmare sequences which provide some truly disturbing hints about a possible future. The joker and deathlok make brief appearances but are very effective and interesting. Lex luthor is very well played by jesse eisenberg, becoming a truly essential character. Henry cavill is a little bit gentle as a superhero, maybe a little too soft to be so important to the plot. Ben affleck was fairly convincing as batman, halfway between civilised and brutal and sometimes stepping back from the line while sometime crossing over it. Wonderwoman is a strong character while being still maybe a little bit conventional and decent.

The writing had some weak spots, like the darkseid intro, and also the fact that darkseid doesnt remember where earth is. Also the entire introduction of flash was quite long and weird.But generally was leagues better, the writing was more on zack snyder stuff, sometimes the characters came off as too cool, but it didnt had too much jokes like the original, that kind of destroyed the flow of the film. My least favourite part was Lois Lane but i mean it was barely in it, in a 4 hour movie its not a big deal.The entire music was way better than i remembered, i dont remember the original being horrible on music but it was just forgettable. The music here was really memorable for the most part in my opinion, mainly cause they used a lot of the original BVS and Man of steel score, and that was awesome in my opinion.The cgi looked good for the most part, which i was not expecting, i think the lighthing of Zack Snyder really helps to hidden special effects, and for the most part i didnt noticed, altough there were some moments were it looked weird, mainly flash running. The fight scenes were better but they were not exactly bad in the original, they just had cring one liners and stupid jokes.The characters feel more fleshed out, cyborg specially is almost the main character, there is also a reason why they are attacking earth, the villain feels like a villain and not some bad CGI. Generally i think the visuals were better. I would have liked some things to be different, but that is more on me, not on zack snyders vision.The best improvement is definitely that this film is more cohesive, is more epic and generally is almost a new movie. I mean if you didnt like zack snyders style, then you wont like the movie, is really simple.In conclusion i think it was worth the wait, i am joining the #RestoreTheSnyderVerse cause what i am seeing is a guy who has ideas and i would love him to fully realize them, i think his ideas are bold and unique for the most part. Sadly i dont think that is going to be the case.Now insert we live in a society jokes.", "This is \"Justice League\" and not \"DC Avengers\"": "It's satisfying to see the movie get a proper treatment. It's definitely better than the theatrical version. And, I believe, that's the biggest plus point it needed. I won't say it's a astonishing masterpiece of a movie, it clearly ain't by a LONG shot. It happens to be my most favorite Zack Snyder film to date. What it does is that it gives every single character an arc so that we're invested in them. And that's the main thing that made the theatrical version so stupid (not the whacky scenes).Whedon tried to make \"DC Avengers\" without realizing that Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg have never been introduced. Avengers worked because it was backed up by five different movies for the lead characters. This had to give a proper introduction to those three characters and it did. And THAT is what saves the movie.There are also scenes that were genuinely funny and also scenes which made certain characters shine. And I almost forgot to mention, every good scene from the theatrical version was by Snyder. And just like in BvS and MoS, there were scenes which felt like a comic book page that feels absolutely stupid in a movie, and some illogically blant sequences. The only difference is that, here, they were entertaining enough for not holding the experience down.The basic plot is still the same. The villain is still generic. And even though I liked it on the whole, I definitely feel it would've been better if it was done AFTER introducing all the necessary characters in their separate movies. It is just too long for a movie where stakes don't feel so high. Honestly, I am more interested in the sequels they teased in this movie. Darkseid doesn't have any role in the movie. He was equivalent to Thanos in GotG. And to be honest, I want to see the sequels it teased (which I don't think will ever be made) more than watching this again. Those little scenes felt bigger than the whole movie. And you cannot compare this with Infinity War or Endgame because it doesn't have higher stakes and it's just a first team up movie; it's just long. The sequels it teased, however, look like they'll be worthy for the said comparison.On the whole, if you have time and if you have ever loved a superhero film, you can watch it. It won't be a waste of time. If you expect this to be an absolutely perfect masterpiece, it's not.Rating : 7.8/10; Grade : A-.", "Entertaining - I really enjoyed this": "With my 53 years, I'm probably not in the target audience for this movie.

I am impressed with the script, director, action and actors. It's all exquisite. Yes, the film is long but here everything comes in the right place throughout the film, and it is very exciting.

I just didn't want this movie to end. I didn't even get tired of watching it. The movie is soo detailed, deep story to make you want more, great dialogues and beautiful performances even if you familiar with some from the first movie.

On the one hand I really loved it, but on the other it seems like it's setting something up that's never gonna come. Maybe it will, but I doubt Snyder's ever coming back to complete his vision here.Anyway, I didn't really care if this cut was finished and released before, but I am very glad it did. This is the cut I will remember now, thinking about Justice League, and it will be a good memory. Well done Zack.", "The Perfect Justice League Movie": "I love the story and the writing on this film, the characters is much much improved and you can care for them, the directing is fantastic, very good soundtracks, 10/10.", "Hope for continuation": "So, i watched this movie almost a week ago. Therefore the most i could remember about it, i will write it in this review.Positive :-First, the CINEMATOGRAPHY of the movie is too good as expected from DCEU.Second, the ACTION SCENES of the movie - OMG they are on top level in terms of presentation. They are so smooth and elegant. There are various kinds of action scenes - war, group battles, one versus one, hero versus hero etc.Third, the LIGHTING of the movie is also amazing. Specially, i love the way how they lights the half portion of Steppenwolf. There are some more visuals, which are so good looking.Fourth, the movie doesn't confuse you with twisty storyline. Instead it gives CLEAR EXPLANATION of each and everything.Fifth, i don't like the bgm in general, but the BGM of WONDER WOMAN - it was so amazing. I put that on my ringtone.Sixth, not to mention, but the VFX used in this movie is also good. I don't say that, it was mind-blowing or something else. But it is sufficient. Btw, i hate the animation or VFX they used for zeus Lighting, instead the same thing used for flash is amazing.Seventh, the character of SUPERMAN is on fire. I would say he was the lifeline of this movie. Whenever the Superman was in frame, i am sure you can't got bored easily. From his acting to fight sequences - he performed very great in all fields.Negatives :-First, the STORY of the movie is too common for superhero movies i.e. \"saving the world\".Second, the COSTUMES/ARMORS designs are so worse and needs lot of improvements.Third, the LENGTH of the movie is 4hrs. Is it joke? We don't have that much time to watch. Then, the SLOW PACED scenes in between makes this situation more worse. I will suggest you to watch it in parts, otherwise that will impact your \"precious\" eyes. Also, obviously a person doesn't have a concentration period of 4hrs. Hence, he/she will be bored definitely in between. Btw, i appreciate that they divided the movie into parts.Fourth, there has been always a limit to everything. Same goes with ACTION. The action is amazing, there is no doubt in it. But there is a LIMIT. Almost after every 30-45 mins, there was an action scene. I would suggest that they cut off some action and give that time to character development or other aspects.Fifth, while watching the movie, i have some MINOR DOUBTS in my mind.Sixth, i know Superman is amazing, but in this movie he overshadowed other characters. This movie focuses so much on Superman in comparison to others.", "better then the theatrical": "I didnt have a big issue with the theatrical cut of Justice league, but i wasnt really satisfied with it either. This version hit all the notes i originally wanted, a longer story giving each of the characters more time to shine, added scenes making the story more impactful and less stupid humor attempts, which this movie also failed at a few times as well, but it wasnt as noticable as it was in the theatrical version.

The cinematics, the plot, the whole movie was great. A complete new movie compared to the previous version. Much darker story, lots of new scenes, lots if altered scenes and lot of scenes removed.

Other than that, this movie really is the Justice League that should have been originally released.Lots of cameos from main event characters. Why they were cut out of the cinema release baffles me. The action is much better too. Well done to Zack Snyder and Crew.", "A good film with about 50 asterisks": "Obviously, the Snyder's cut is way better than the theatrical disaster that was The Justice League.However, even Snyder's cut could've been greatly improved. Even with all the character establishment and development, it still could've been trimmed to at least 3 hours, since some of the scenes are not that necessary, or are too slow, including some of the action-oriented ones.We get all Snyder's trademarks, so the film is very dark and depressing 100% of the time. It's always raining or snowing, everyone is bitter, you know. The mention of Snyder's personal tragedy and the credits song (while perfectly understandable) leaves you even in a worse mood and state, especially if you investigate a little on who is the Autumn the film is dedicated to. I love dark films but this one was too much for me sometimes.Since there was no planning involved as in Marvel films if you don't read the source material you have to check some additional information to be able to understand who some of the characters are, especially closer to the end.The tone of some of the scenes is messed up, some of them are unintentionally funny, some are just confusing. But there is a lot of good ones in this. Even the overuse of slow-mo doesn't hurt these.Acting-wise, Gal Gadot still cannot act, everyone else acted mostly average (while the casting itself was good in the first place).On the technical side of things, I never got used to the aspect ratio (while I'm sure it was done this way for a reason), the CGI in some of the new scenes wasn't great, but not in a way that would pull you out of the film. The soundtrack was weak though, with an exception of the Luthor Arkham scene.Unlike the theatrical cut, it sparks an interest in you on what could be the follow-up to this (along with confusion, of course). Also, I'm pretty sure that the film was made this way as a visual representation of a comic book (if this can be a thing).Feels like the whole background to this and the failure of the theatrical cut boosted the Snyder's cut ratings, but I'd still give it a solid 7. Lots of bad stuff, lots of good stuff. I'm sure this works much better if you're a comic fan though.", "Outstanding": "4 hours of pure entertainment!!!

This film has everything that a superhero movie should have, from amazing action & story to powerful visuals and perfect score by Tom Holkenborg, which helped the audience to feel nostalgic and have a sense of continuity to prior DCEU films. This movie explored all the characters with perfection. Each individual felt important and had a purpose. Even the villain side had a purpose of their own, all fell into right place. This film sewed up way more threads to create multiple storylines while sticking to the main plot unambiguously and left many other possibilities to explore if given chance. This fandom driven movie will definitely be remembered for a long time in the future which changed the history of hollywood industry and will never lose it's respect for the visionary director, Mr. Zack Snyder.", "A complete different movie, finally something worth of the DC universe": "We had to wait four long years for the definitive version of Justice League. This was Zack Snyder original vision and it is a beautifully developed and executed concept.This director's cut fix a ton of issues that the original movie had. First of all, the superheroes team is extremely balanced and everyone contributes to develop the plot. Aquaman is not just a useless puppet, but finally shows his real skills and becomes an essential character. The story of Cyborg is deepen: his past, the relationship with his father, all of his traumas and how he coped with it, the fact that he cannot self-accept himself because of his new form. Flash, who I could not stand back then, here is way better and you actually understand who he is and why he behaves in a certain way. Diana has such amazing action sequences, far better compared to the original cut. Moreover we get to know more the Amazons. Superman is not over powered (finally). His entry on the final battle is just perfect. Last but not least, Bruce Wayne, the cherry on this delicious cake, the man that bringed together the Justice League, philanthropist, genius and inventor. Not to mention all the other superheroes like The Martian Manhunt or villains such as The Joker. This time Jared Leto gave a better performance, despite his short screen time.It is pretty gore for a superheroes movie. Snyder was not scared at all to show explicit violence. Special effects were simply fantastic and I was stunned by the photography. What really bothered me is the aspect ratio: why making this movie in 4:3, does not make any sense. I am pretty sure that I would have enjoyed it more on a wide format. I know that is an artistic choice, but still I cannot understand it.Superheroes movies can be extremely good, if there is a well thought and written screenplay, a solid narrative component and true efforts among the director and the crew. This film felt and looked different. This is how you set the ground for a sequel, this is how you create interest in your audience. Thank you Snyder for this amazing gift. Hope that DC will learn, and will start to make more stuff like this, especially after the Wonder Woman 1984 disaster.", "I thought it was a 2 hours long movie !": "Well, it seems that great moments often pass quickly! I was impressed by Zack Snyder's style of storytelling in this movie. The movie was dark but still very humorous and touching, Zack wasn't wrong when he said that Cyborg was the heart of the movie! Ray did a very great job as Cyborg, the others like Ben, Gal, Jason, Ezra, Henry and Amy were all really good. I understand that they had only 70 millions so the vfx can't looks so great but it wasn't a big deal. The action sequences were not great (also due to the low budget) but still good. The music was pretty awesome, Junkie XL did a great job too! Of course it was not perfect but it was much better than the thing we got in 2017!\n#restoretheSnyderverse", "Overrated": "Honestly who wants to watch a movie with around 3 hours of character building? The entire DCU is a mess and this movie has done little to change that. There are still plenty of unanswered questions and plot holes. You could almost make an entire stand alone Cyborg movie with all the footage they have of him. The best part of the entire movie was in fact a dream sequence which actually has no place in the film. The CGI and fight sequences are average at best and there is too much slow motion, even for a 4 hour long film.", "Hero ain't a job.": "First of all, congratulate Zack Snyder's create could be published after the sentimental, embarrassed and cliche movie which performances in cinemas five years, Zack give one awesome for the audiences; thus, the producers are the most enemy for film director when they keep the final cut privilege. Stay four hours in the theater, drinking the beverage and eating the popcorn, just rarely people could afford the length of this movie, and fans would not miss every second until their bladder be filled. Fortunately, this movie is screened on streaming media, therefore, people would watching at any time, while waiting for public transportation, you can go to the toilet, before bed watching a part of it, and commute. The audiences just pretending it is a seven episodes TV show possessed the wonderful visual experience and enrich of the special efficacy. Mention the visual experience and special efficacy, in Snyder's Justice League, Steppenwolf and Cyborg's metal surface look like more metallic gloss, but in the front edit looks like two poor cosplayers are showing, the sliver-made armor and weapons seem like flowing, every part is mirrored like, through that demonstrate Snyder spend great power to improve the character; the hue and luminance all harmonious made it not weird on visual, the 2017 edit, Whedon wanna the audiences felt the reborn of Superman is hopefulness and happiness, he has chosen the warm hue, Snyder did not destroy the hue in the whole film, he has chosen the sun form hidden to rise with Superman to fly upward, this is camera language. Above my expectations, two fresh heroes and three new roles: in 2017 edit, The Flash and Cyborg' position only one tool with the superpower, like in an RPG game, wanna move to next step? Follow Cyborg but no ask, he would guide your league to finish the story. But in Snyder's JL, the director describes the character's mental full the focus in the story, every character has the motive, audiences can comprehend the lengthy plot directly. The Flash fall in love, have goal's in life; Cyborg tangle with family, does not have identification for his reborn physical limbs and body. The villain: Steppenwolf, who has a distinct reason and plan, would finally be won the invasion if Superman did not reborn. In 2017, we only saw a weirdo with two horns travel worldwide and kick off by league. Snyder's JL uses a different size of the picture and also unprecedented of superhero movie, 4:3. The information could access from the screen less than normal size, personally, but it means audiences will focus more clearly on the screen; the whole movie becomes more epic and artful cuz this size, every frame is gorgeous. Nonetheless, the most remorseful is all of us, know the story would never published the trilogy, a stunning beginning be killed by the producer.", "Good but not great": "Short Review of the Justice League (Zack Snider edition).\nPositives:\n1: Chemistry\nThe extra 2 hours significantly helped with the chemistry between our hero's.\nGently pushing the hero's from being strangers, into becoming the Justice League.\n(And made the former unbearably bad humor from Barry Allen, bearable and at time quite endearing).2: Silver lining (sub-plot).\nWe can all agree that the main plot is hopeless, even with Zack Snider working his magic. But the sub-plot of the alternative universes, which explores the limits of our (otherwise godlike) heroes, makes for a quite intriguing twist to the generic struggle which the main plot presents. A sub-plot which contradicts the focus of the main, which states that actions and finals are not final (as Barry Allan can turn back time, and the mothercubes bring back what once was).2: Soundtrack\nJust solidifies, very satisfyingly, the epicenes in the moment. Solid work.Negatives:\n1: Non-Threatening villain\nAs a concept the idea of our villain \"Steppenwolf\" falls short on so many occasions. If I were to ask you, the audience, if you ever felt threatened by Steppenwolf, the answer would probably be a resounding \"No\". He is a big fellow in metal spandex with spikes, very intimidating...\nEven his boss \"DC's Thanos\", is so irrelevant to the plot. And yes, I know, the plot concerns itself about the \"Mothercubes\", which he felt on the earth after being beaten by the former \"Defenders of Earth\"! And then subsequently forgot about them for thousands of years, even though they posses the power to eliminate worlds, which is \"DC Thanos'\" real passion.\nAnd then after Steppenwolf slams the ground hard, we find that earth is even more important. Because it contains the anti-life code. But \"DC Thanos\" did the same exact thing when he fought the Defenders. (But apparently forgot (or did not read the scorch markings) about this \"Ultimate weapon\" when he slammed the ground hard).2: Amazonians\nThe Amazonian plotline is by far the weakest in the movie, from the terrible CGI landscape to the cringeworthy fight choreography, we should just erase everything about them from our memory.\n(But seriously look at the shoots where Wonder women is at the Amazon Temple, its horrific).3: Weak character development\nThe big thing about a 4-hour movie, is that we have time to explore and learn about our characters. Make the audience care for them and root with them in challenging times.\nCYBORG.\nExcept... Even with all the screen time given to CYBORG, we do not actually care about him. He seems flat, where the only defining him, is the defiance of his father.\nAnd as stated before, there is no feel of \"real\" danger to the hero's, even though they technically die in another timeline. (And because they can resurrect people hahaha which is very convenient).All in all:\nDescent movie which is worth a watch if you enjoy watching Batman and Co.

What's not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes.\" -Martin ScorseseIt seemed fitting to begin my thoughts on this film with these infamous words, that reverberated throughout the landscape of Hollywood and filmmaking. Like the Western genre of old, comic book movies have been a dominant presence at the box office, leading science fiction and fantasy filmmaking into the turn of the century. This has led some to wonder, at what cost?Gone are the days of comics having to fight for a space on the big screen and at the box office. What was once relegated to summer, has now muscled its way into all seasons. Today, studios are seemingly at war for the next great comic book property, dumping cash into anything with a cape. One such powerful studio is Warner Bros. Enter Zack Snyder and Warner's comic publisher DC, along with it's most famous team the Justice League.After dredging through the embellishments and flat out lies said about Zack Snyder, his versions of Justice League and his unfortunate family tragedy, the fans who campaigned from 2017 onward, along with the director himself, finally got to see this massive film rise like the proverbial phoenix from the ashes. The distinction between 2017's Justice League and Zack Snyder's, makes these two movies seem worlds apart. Multiverses even! One example is Zack's signature style of opening his movies with jaw dropping visuals. The film begins with a roar signaling to the audience that this will be unlike any comic book film you've ever experienced. Where the 2017 version attempts to ape the Marvel Cinematic Universe's (MCU) formulaic approach, Zack Snyder's Justice League looks to raise the bar on comic book filmmaking. The four hour epic fancies a daring gamble when compared to Disney's Marvel Studios. The latter has benefited greatly from the assistance of animation studios that produce pre-visualizations and wholly constructed CGI renderings that map out 60% to 90% of Marvel Studios' individual movies, often times, long before a director is chosen. That being said, it's ironic that Warner Bros., the studio that claimed to be \"director driven\", allowed their execs to drive Zack Snyder away from Justice League. They handed his film over to Joss Whedon and he butchered Snyder's work and cobble together the theatrical version. They tried to pawn that disaster off as a Zack Snyder film, but his fans knew better than that, didn't they.In this Zack Snyder directed DC film, you can see his choices in style and visual language evolved. From the colorization to aspect ratios, his movies share the same universe, but still exhibit certain storytelling distinctions that depict different genres. Man of Steel is a science fiction film about humanities first contact with alien life, how humanity would respond to such a jarring experience. The story of the ultimate immigrant (Kal El/Clark Kent) who sacrifices his own heritage in order to save his adopted world. Batman v Superman continues that depiction of a grounded reality and examines humanity through the lens of a political thriller. What happens when mankind's existence thinks it's threatened? What do the ultimate men (Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor) do in the face of what they perceive as inevitable extinction? What else must the ultimate-alien-immigrant have to sacrifice in order to save his world? Zack Snyder's films test the mettle of these iconic characters. He never allows their nearly centuries old existence to stand in the way of challenging their importance and why they have stood the test of time thus far. Justice League affectionately known as The Snyder Cut, is a culmination of ideas: humanity, sacrifice, politics, heritage, legacy, hope, love, redemption, resurrection. All of these elements and more are explored on a grand scale through the actions of desperate characters uniting to fill the void left behind by one of the greatest tragedies in comic book history: the death of Superman.Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince travel the globe in search of Arthur Curry, the Aquaman, the Cyborg Victor Stone and the man who moves in a Flash, Barry Allen. Zack Snyder presents this escalation of storytelling like Homer's 'Iliad' or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, with a dash of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. His entire filmography has lead to this motion picture. When watching and admiring the scale of it all, I couldn't help but think that it was deliberately reminiscent of comic book art, specifically Alex Ross' work. Within what some have argued is an over saturated genre in a bloated market, Zack Snyder has delivered a truly \"graphic\" graphic novel-come to life. It's so visually arresting! His signature use of slow motion sequences allow the viewer to take in the majesty of these characters and the world in which they inhabit. There are various scenes that slow down like the pages inked by Scott Williams and drawn by Jim Lee. The film brought me back to my days of reading Grant Morrison's 'JLA' Justice League comics. It was amazing to see the grandiose universe of Jack Kirby's Fourth World, heaving and breathing with visceral prowess in the form of Steppenwolf and the looming threat of Darkseid. For a character that wasn't the main antagonist, he was genuinely terrifying (which is almost an understatement).I have to applaud the stand out performances of Ray Fisher as Victor Stone. He has a presence in his own right, one reminiscent of a seasoned veteran actor. His voice, movements and body language were so precise and captivating. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and The Batman was the epitome of character growth, while witnessing his visceral character arch from the previous films pay off. Ben's work in the role is quite brilliant in its cool subtlety. He never lets you forget that there's a fire inside of him when necessary, one that has allowed him to withstand 20 years in Gotham and an alien invasion. With every appearance in the DCEU, Ben Affleck may have set the bar higher as the greatest Batman of the silver screen. But even then, Ezra Miller's Barry Allen may have completely stolen the show with an action piece that hurled The Flash into the film's MVP spot.Overall, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a beautifully powerful love letter to DC's comic book history and fantasy storytelling. Is it cinema? I don't know if Martin Scorsese would consider it as such, but one could argue when compared to its peers, it comes closer in cultivating high art with fantasy filmmaking, aiming to capture what could be deemed cinema. The Dark Knight trilogy in all of its brilliance, lacked the bombastic elements that make up the DC universe. Recently Joker did a fine job of imitating classics, but as great as that was, it lacked the soul of originality. The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a lot of money and delivered the closest thing to a live action Saturday morning cartoon that some audiences may have dreamed of (for better or worse). Even if you don't consider Zack Snyder's Justice League cinema, you'd be remiss if you didn't marvel at the masterful attempt- and even then, you have to be honest with yourself... the Snyder Cut is cinema.", "Thanks Zack Snyder!": "I Wish I Have Never Watched The Thetrical Version So That I Would Experience The Snyder Cut At The Fullest . This Version of Justice League Is Like Alot Better Than The Whole DC Universe And Even More Entertaining . Just Waiting For The Upcoming Projects of Zack Snyder In D.C. , If That Happens! #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Wery nice": "God but its dont have any plan for next parts. And the slomotion times was wery much.", "-": "In a way, this \"new\" version of Justice League works better than the two movies that precede it, as there is no longer any real intention to try to frame it in a parallel to our reality, going more towards the mythical narratives that it presents -even more due to the presence of great alien beings whose only objective is reduced to mere planetary conquest.But if before we could blame Joss Whedon for (almost) referencing himself in the late modifications in the version he found himself working, here we realise this was already the desire of Snyder and Chris Terrio, trying to insert humour, nonexistent in previous films, and to create scenes that recall the heroism that these characters should represent in their genesis.The screenplay remains weak, with phrases as hilariously memorable as \"Evil doesn't sleep, it waits\" expressed with such seriousness that we don't understand whether to take this script more or less seriously, after Batman v Superman. In fact, the R rating seems almost offensive, since there's nothing, apart from sparse blood samples and a (very unnecessary) beheading, that illustrates the need of such an \"exclusive\" rating. Rather, it presents itself as the most generically appreciable and consumable film, which already in 2017 would lack greater originality. It is rather infuriating, after BvS intended to dismantle certain aspects of these heroic narratives, that this script doesn't even try to minimally deconstruct the basic narrative structure that we tend to see for over a decade.Even any potential conflicts between the characters are quickly resolved, just to introduce the next action scene or narrative exposition. A discussion between the newly created team around the possibility of bringing Superman back to life -to which even Whedon would later try to offer some conflict, although with little success- doesn't offer the opportunity to see their members struggle since, in the end, everyone ends up agreeing and proceeding with the mission.Even the first sequence against Steppenwolf (the same as we've already seen), where they are unable to work entirely as a team, doesn't reveal consequences, as they haven't failed in their goal of rescuing the prisoners. So, if we aren't able to invest in the difficulties of the titular team, how else should we be invested in a story that can be summarised as the effort to prevent an alien from destroying the planet? But more subtlety and care would not be expected, from who suddenly inserted a giant monster at the end of Dawn of Justice without any anticipation.When in the end we are introduced to the concept of time travel, this concept could have been used in conjunction with the visions about the apocalyptic future that are presented to us. Seeing the heroes defeated at the end, I thought that would be the moment where this version would effectively demonstrate its difference, suddenly transposing us into the future, for it to be undone by Flash's abilities. But not even when we see a scene that points to this fateful reality in the epilogue, is it felt more than a stimulus for the sequels that will not come.Like this aspect, Darkseid's presence also makes no difference. Again, it's just another appearance that intends to establish a background threat. And the so called fans will be satisfied with the promise of these aspects, as if small references were enough to understand the story that isn't told.And when before (in the 2017 version) the duration was inevitably short for the number of characters that were intended to be presented, here the doubling of the movie's duration doesn't revert in almost anything to the improvement of this aspect. Batman remains the same useless character throughout the film who, in his aged version, would not even be able to get close to his empowered companions. Worse, his position here in the face of Superman's death remains drastically contrary to what he demonstrated in Batman v Superman and, thus, our perception of this character proves to be as schizophrenic as before.Also the development of Barry Allen's character, without the pathetic dialogues incorporated by Whedon, is still anecdotal, which, in the total two hundred and forty-two minutes of duration, does not receive more development than before. His first scene where he expresses his abilities for the first time to the audience, adds nothing but to his energetic and irritating interactions.If even in Victor Stone we can easily and happily recognise a more frank approach, even better exposing Ray Fisher's acting skills, his narrative arc is still the most basic possible, summarised in three or four sentences: Cyborg blames his father; Cyborg's father sacrifices himself; Cyborg starts to value his father, and decides to honour his memory.If, in fact, we recognise a character in search of his humanity, where before there was only a plot device, its basic characterisation doesn't become excusable just by comparison with an even lower standard, when within the story itself we recognise potential for more. Given the creation of Cyborg through the strange device they intend to destroy, could the mistrust of the rest of the members be a real cause for concern and discussion for the whole team. His origin could even have been harnessed by the villain against the heroes themselves, a potentially traitorous element among the heroes, bringing even more tragedy to the character.The real difference more clearly felt here is, in fact, the music. If in 2017, the Danny Elfman's score intended to bring the tone of that version of the film closer to the Avengers films, perhaps that fact was only symptomatic of what the film was already going for. Because the general tone of this script is as relieved as the other in the short interactions between the team, even without the inclusion of the embarrassed jokes.Thus, one sees, in fact, the influence that cinematography and music of a film can have in the final result, because while the vibrant colour palette and the score composed of wind instruments (of the 2017 version) pointed to a relaxed and more classic tone, here the darker cinematography, in conjunction with the music composed by Tom Holkenborg, which includes a strong presence of female choirs and percussion, transfers us to the intended grandeur and \"modernism\". Despite this, at the same time, we recognise the inclusion of electric guitars at certain moments as a forced attempt to inject a cool tone to what should feel like something memorable by itself.Even if this had been the version released in its original period, it would feel like an attempt to achieve the efforts of Marvel Studios that it so clearly is, without the characters to support the patent effort. Furthermore, if it had suffered the inevitable cuts in its runtime, there would certainly be little more differentiation between the versions, apart from the more obvious visual and musical dissimilarities. The film is still the most basic story possible, without the relationships and dynamics sufficiently developed to illustrate these as the heroes that we so easily recognise. The problems were never presented between one or the other version, but rather in the inconsistency of the author himself, who, regardless of any contributions and modifications by others, always established this as his vision throughout the different films. The one on whom -instead of the characters transported to the screen- the narrative has always centered.", "Warner is the worst production company": "Best superhero's movie ..\nThanks zack ...\nI know now what mean superhero's ..\nI hope this world is complete \ud83d\ude4f", "Definitely an upgrade": "The most common misconception with this film is that it's an extended version of the 2017 theretical version of Justice League. This is very much not the case. The movie is a completely different film in almost every way.Even though it's great, it still has flaws. Most audience reviews call it amazing, but that is mostly because fans are only talking about how much better it is than Joss Whedon's JL.First off, the movie really doesn't need to be 4 hours long. There are several scenes in the movie that were unnecessary and could easily be cut. For example, 90% of Lois Lane's scene could be cut and would have no effect on the rest of the movie.Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher could of had better acting. A lot of their lines struggle to have any emotion because of how they are portraying their characters and as a result you really don't care about them as much as you should. However, the character arcs that The Flash and Cyborg go on in the movie are really amazing and have some great scenes. The rest of the actors had good acting.The soundtrack was mostly a massive improvement. The only complaint I have is Wonder Woman's theme in this movie. It is really hard to listen to and they overplay it even though it doesn't appear in many scenes.The CGI was kind of 50/50. The visuals were great but Cyborg never looked real to me and there were a few other green-screen scenes that looked off. However, I can look past that considering this movie was working on a much smaller budget than it originally had and its impressive what they managed to do with the money they had.Overall, Zack Snyder's Justice League is significantly better than than theretical version. It has a list of flaws but none of them ruin great parts of the movie and the experience you get from watching it. Fun action, sometimes bad acting, but it's still a great movie", "Far, Far, Far Superior": "This film is what Justice League should have been. The characters are more fleshed out, the story is much better. Gone is the faux comedy of Joss Whedon's attempt and we have a legitimate superhero story with gravitas and heart.Warner Bros would do well to take this version on board and create their cinematic universe based on it (but we know they won't)", "100% Better than What We Saw in 2017": "In my opinion, this not a whole new movie. This a director cut of a previous movie. So we need to stop act like this is JL2.\nThis director cut is better than theatrical cut in every way.\nStory is clear, explain the movie as it should be.\nEvery chapter were important.\nEvery character got their fair time. In theatrical cut most characters were useless. Some of them were used just for make jokes. Building up characters is so good in this cut. every character had their moment.\nCGI is in good level. Cinematography and visualizing is perfect. Every single shot is beautiful.\nVillains are truly badass. And their purpose were clear.\nThis is almost a perfect CBM. I really enjoyed it. Actually this is the best CBM experience in my life. This must be continue. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "WHAT?? WHAT HAVE HAPPENED?!": "I am no fan of neither the \"Man of Steel\" (2013), or \"Batman v Superman\" (2016). Mainly because some characters were portrayed far to different and uncharacteristic from what is established over the last decades, and that the script did not justify their behavior and so on. I also fond the stories in those movies to be a bit watered out, and the little plot that was in them just seemed to work as a tool and an excuse to use CGI to cover up that the plot was thin... Or perhaps the makers/writers of those movies spent so much time on the action sequences that they forgot that a movie also needs a good story and a good plot, or perhaps they just ran out of time to write a better script?But THIS movie was a HUUUUUUUUUUGE improvement in my opinion! There were a couple of things that I did not like, as the unnecessary \"bargaining\" with the village leader when it was already known who to speak with, \"Wonder Woman is quick enough to stop bullets in the air but not quick enough to prevent someone from exchanging a magazine! A trident have how many prongs?! \"The Flash\" already being \"The Flash\" at that point in his life (see Wikipedia for example about the origin), and that he to a certain degree was portrayed as a babbling idiot... I also really hope that the \"prophesies\" will not be the direction that this series will take if there will be any other movies in this series! If so, that would in my opinion potentially be the same as taking a HUUUUUUUUUUGE step down back to the level of the two previous movies. But neither of these problems bothered me that much in this particular movie. The direction hinted to in the \"prophesies\" might become a problem later if that is the direction this series will take later on though.On the other hand: FINALY there was a script to rival the amazing action and ditto special effects in the movie :-D !!! The script, the plot, the score, the sound and graphical effects, the acting and so on were all more or less extremely well done. For example the acting by Jeremy Irons as \"Alfred\". I also like Ben Affleck as \"Batman\" in this movie as well (it is not his fault that the script have not been good enough until this movie). The music played when \"Wonder Woman\" fights, and when \"The Justice League\" fights is plain and simple awesome! The slow motion action during the movie that I found extremely nice to watch in \"Wonder Woman\" (2017) was also equivalently nice in this movie. And the villain was great and fitting for \"The Justice League\" to tackle. Much better than the really bad version of \"Lex\" earlier (again, probably because of the script, and not because of Jesse Eisenberg). The way the villain communicated with his boss/master was also very cool.In my opinion, the ultimate judge of the quality of a movie: Was I bored, or was I entertained and captivated during the movie? The answer in this case is without doubt the last two... Take into consideration that this movie lasts FOUR HOURS, and I do not believe that I was bored for as much as a minute or so during the entire movie! Yes there were I couple of things that I did not like in the movie, but I did not dislike those things that much either. There was also SO much more in the movie that was great and amazing than the things that I did not like that much. The conclusion is without a doubt that I found this movie to be a huge and positive surprise!If you liked the two previous movies, do not even hesitate to watch this one! And if you, as I did not like the two other movies, watch this one anyways: I for one found it to be a HUUUUUUUUUUGE step up in quality. Especially concerning the script!", "Warner Brothers better pay this man to finish his vision!!!!": "First off this a completely different Justice League than the one we saw. I don't know how they did THAT, with THIS! This movie is f'n awesome. Four hours was long to sit but it was worth it. Snyder uses all of the time to actually explain the movie and the different characters. I'm praying that the success of this release will get the powers to be to smarten up and pay Snyder whatever it takes to make DC as close as possible to Marvel. This is by far and away the best DC movie and it's not even close! Man of Steel was really good also in my opinion also. Get your snacks, drinks and whatever else and get ready for the movie we deserved all along! #ForAutumn", "Snyder got most of this right!!!": "Well the the time finally came!!! The Snyder cut of Justice League us finally here!!! Was all the hype and wait wort it? Mostly yes.I have not been a fan of the DC Snyderverse. I only kind of liked Man of Steel but rarely rewatch it. I absolutely hated Batman vs Superman. I just didn't like Snyder's take on Batman or even less of Superman. I know tgat the comics have gone darker on the character and tgat some like that bit I am very much a purist at least with Superman. I despised BvS. Then in 2017 came Justice League and even though I liked it more than what came before it it was painfully average. DC had in no way come close to what Marvel had done with it's characters letbalone Avengers. Justice League had a troubled production and Zack Snyder had to leave the film for personal reasons. Josh Whedon took over. Seemed like a good idea at the time he directed Avengers film and its sequel so it would be solid right? Wrong. Justice League was average at best. It was really joke like The Avengers but the tone wasn't right for Justice League. The characters were paper thin, especially Cyborg and Flash. There was no emotional connection to any of the other characters either. I didn't like Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Jason Momoa as Aquaman was also given nothing to do. Gal Gadot faired better as Wonder Woman/Diana but not much more. Then there's Henry Cavill as Superman. I have never liked him in the character. It is probably more what he was given in the script and Zack Snyder's take on Superman that I didn't like but he was just a bit player in this film. Needless to say even though I didn't hate Justice League, it was just a film that I had no desire to revisit.So on to the 4 hour extravaganza that is Zack Snyder's Justice League. I had pretty low expectations to start with on the version because of how underwhelmed I was with the other 3 other DC films with hus name on them. I purposely avoided reviews and ratings on this before watching. And even though I had seen the Whedon cut I had only seen it once so I didn't know it so well do compare it with this new version. To my surprise, I felt I was liking this version more with the first hour. Right away, I could tell this film had more going for it. The story is the same of course but the characters are much more fleshed out. The biggest complaint about the theatrical cut was that the character development was almost absent. Here, that I'd much improved. Especially with Victor Stone/Cyborg. His backstory is much richer here. In the other version he is really just a character there for the plot sake and his abilities. Here hid relationship with his father is focused on and he is I feel much more important to the story. He is really the heart of the film. Ray Fisher is really good. Also Ezra Miller is really good as Barry Miller/The Flash. His arc is better here. More about his father being in prison and his need for his father to be proud of him. The basic setup is the same. Bruce Wayne is putting together a team to battle Steppenwolf, which has come to earth to retrieve 3 mother boxes to firm a Unity to conquer earth. Here is one of the big changes in this version. First, the look of of Steppenwolf here is much better. In the theatrical cut, the CGI generated character's look was dull and underwhelming. The look was upgraded to have Steppenwolf have a sort of shinier armor look. It looks much better than before. Also, we see his master Darkseid also. Just a passing mention in the Whedon cut, Darkseid gets goid screen time here so even though Steppenwolf is theain baddie, Darkseid is presented as a future threat. Again, the biggest improvement here is tone and character development. We care more about what's going on becayse we dare about the characters.I'm not going to go into a shot for shot summary of what's different. At 4 hours of course the new version has alot more time to flesh out characters and plot points. Maybe the original.plan was to do what Marvel did with Infinity War and End Game. 2 separate almost 3 hour films released separately. But because this new Justice League version was to be released to streaming it was all one film. Some of things I didn't like the first time around are still there. Superman gets brought back but is really just a bit player here. Amy Adam's is back as Lois Lane, but nothing special happens with her. She was wasted as Lois in my opinion. She's given little to do. There is a nice scene between Cavill and Diane Lane as Martha Kent but again, Snyder doesn't seem to like Superman very much. He's just there because he's powerful and can fight Steppenwolf. The final action scene is very much tge same as tge other version but they did change the look from red to a dark grey which looks better. The film is divided into six chapters and an elpilogue. I don't mind a long 4 hour film but I do think that a good amount of this film could have been left out. There are a couple little cameos tgat are cool but don't really add anything. The ending feels really stretched out. I think that a door 40 minutes could have been left out and the film would have been tighter. But what is here, much better than the theatrical cut\nI am pleased with this version of Justice League. It is a better film every way. It isn't on the level of the last 2 Avengers films. Marvel has done a much better job in creating its cinematic universe that DC has. For one, their individual films have been better. DC seems to be playing catch up. If this is a restart for DC, it's a good start.Grade: B.", "that's a good cut!": "Goes to show studios know nothing. Much more enjoyable, layed out, exposed, all those good keywords to adjectivese a story. Very enjoyable.

So much better than the 1st - 4 hours flew by", "Finally some competition for Marvel": "Whedon's Justice League strayed so much from its path, that a Snyder version was inevitable. But with so much anticipation, the movie still took me by storm. The movie is far from perfect, and a lot of the hype (9's and 10's) may be undeserved as they are given by hype, and not by true evaluation.Still, Snyder delivered an amazing action movie, not tainted by failed CGI and full of character and emotion. That's not to say there are no flaws, such as too much slow motion, or Gal Gadot's acting which started fine but slowly went from bad to worse. Or Ben Affeck who felt out of place and unmotivated.But boy, did Snyder deliver on exactly what was needed. Such as decent action, a coherent story, some eye candy and cameos. Not only did we get to see an ultimate villain like Darkside, who is DC's Thanos, he also did Darkseid justice! But what made the movie work, where the compelling characters. And those were The Flash and Victor Stone/Cyborg. They delivered so much backstory and character, that it's unfathomable why the heck Whedon decided to leave that out.All in all this amazing and entertaining movie was too long with its 4 hours. The pacing was confusing as it kept changing from 1st to 5th gear and back. So I'll borrow my final judgement from another reviewer who fittingly said that Justice League is not a great movie, but it's compiled out of great scenes that don't always match, but at least will keep you entertained for a long time.", "The Motherbox": "One of the most epic superhero movies in history. It can be compared with Avengers' last two part, Infinity War and Endgame. Long and fast paced action pack. Though it's length at the last half an hour seems to me a bit longer.

I showed someone the Gotham sewer fight scene differences between Whedon and Snyder, and the difference was stark. Whedon jumped between different scenes, making the action incoherent and unexciting, and his choice of music made the scenes silly; finally Whedon capped it off with cheesy villain dialogue from Steppenwolf. Snyder on the other hand set the mood with excitement building music, and took time to show what each character was thinking and feeling in each action sequence, allowing the audience to savor each sequence and allowing time for the excitement to set in; and by allowing Steppenwolf to shut up, he was a far more effective villain.The last action sequence was thoroughly butchered by Whedon. It was dumb, pointless, silly and forgettable. Snyder's on the other hand had a gameplan, with the team working together to accomplish a goal and bringing the audience along; and like all good action endings, the plan doesn't go to plan which allows the audience to feel the essential emotions required for action movies: tension and fear.Wonderful Snyder!! Wondeful! You made me believe again!", "Wonderful and incredible": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is, simply put, an absolute brilliant film. The pacing, action, acting, cinematography/visuals, and score are all top notch. While the 4-hour runtime may at first seem daunting to take on, the film actually moves along in a way that feels more like a 2 1/2-hour movie. This is a beautiful testament to Snyder using every bit of that time to masterfully build the story & character arcs in a way that feels entirely earned.A few spoiler-free thoughts/standouts:1. The Action: Phenomenal action! It's nothing short of thrilling, to say the least. The action all throughout this film was a huge standout & all perfectly shot by Zack Snyder.2: Wonder Woman: In my opinion, this movie was hands down the BEST portrayal of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman so far. She's strong, feminine, inspiring, and downright the warrior we know & want her to be. She fits into this film so well & Gadot's performance is top notch.3. Cinematography: The cinematography & visuals could not be better! This is an absolutely GORGEOUS film with exceptional CGI. Snyder did a phenomenal job of making every single shot in this movie look incredible.4: The Score: Wow! Tom Holkenborg took on a TREMENDOUS task of composing nearly 4 hours of music for this movie & it absolutely does not go unnoticed. I would even go as far to say that the music in this IS a character that supplements the story and visuals perfectly. It is such a beautiful score.Verdict: As I said in my title, this is a bold, beautiful & brilliant film that is 100% worth the wait and worth watching. In my opinion, this is the BEST DCEU movie & is honestly now one of my favorite films as well. 10 out of 10.", "It's actually pretty brilliant": "Snyder's got a style. And for a lot of people (including myself) that style doesn't always work. However, Zack Snyder may very well be one of Hollywood's best directors. He has a style, which many directors don't have and his films are exceptionally well shot. This film, is especially gorgeous. There are shots that really mesmerized me. Specifically the shots of Iceland and the shots of the Flash running. Now, from a writing standpoint, this is probably Zack Snyder's best written film. Cyborg and the Flash both shine and are really well introduced. Cyborg, specifically is the best character DC has written in awhile. Ray Fisher is an awesome actor who I'd love too see as Cyborg again. Next Ray Fisher movie that comes out, I'll be first in line. Darkseid was an awesome addition. So dang cool. Dasaad was also well adapted form the comic. Steppenwolf is leagues better than whatever he was in 2017. The look, the CGI, the costume, the voice even the reading axe are all vast improvements. His character design is strong and the writing and motivation are fine, but could have been better. There are scenes that go on too long (namely the Icelandic fishing scene) and scenes that could have been cut. Aquaman and Superman never really had enough to do. However, this movie might hold up as one of the best superhero movies ever made. Is it the best? No. But it's probably around number four.

This was one hundred times better than the original Justice League, and Snyder did a far better job than he who shall not be named.This movie contains six parts. These parts help the film to spread its legs and have fun. When you watch the Snyder Cut, it doesn't feel like four hours, it just feels like an adventure. Stephenwolfe's character design was vastly improved, and the ending was superior to the original. It is a must watch for anyone who loves superheroes!", "My eyes are bleeding": "A real torture!The point of having the Snyder cut was to get a better version than the first...well it is definitely not. Not only the visual effects are still poor (ok Henry Cavill is back to his normal self but come on it wasn't the only thing to fix!) but they completely got rid of the fantastic Danny Elfman's music and original themes !

The fight scenes are super fast to really see what's going on, and that's irritating.It's time to change wonder woman, she looks tired and old in most scenes. CGI is patchy, especially makes the villians pathetic, even though they are supposed to be scary.Actors who've done a bad job are, cyborg's father, Batman, wonderwoman, and joker... The joker looks like a pale shadow compared to earlier Batman movie.And again DC movies get humor underdone or overdone, this movie is another classic example.If you have nothing to do during lockdown, even then I won't recommend this.", "Better than original": "I love it better than original. The amount that was cut out just ruined the movie and thankfully was released right.", "The satisfying epic original vision of the director at last, yet not exempt from its own flaws. Glad creators are given a chance to show their vision nonetheless": "MILD SPOILERS -- for those of you who, like me, like to know the overall themes o f the movie without spoiling important plotpoints:Where to begin... This 4 hour parade of endless creativity and world building is a fantastic example of how to tell a new story but still faithful to the source material. There are so many good choices in terms of character designs and arcs, sets, camera shots, fights and presentation. It's baffling to me that this movie was chopped off so much yet understandable seeing the magnitude of the story the director wanted to tell.It's impossible not to compare both movies of the same name when talking about the changes or modifications of some scenes and plot elements. All of them, however, for the better as they improved the tone of the movie considerably. The humor was toned down and some of the more awkward scenes were straight out removed like they never happened and it couldn't have served the movie better. There's no other way to describe this movie other than EPIC. It was a good, old-fashioned, action-packed, end-of-the-world story filled with well-realised stakes, characters and plot points. I was pleasantly surprised at the approach to this story as the scale of it was way greater than the theatrical release. And in change, way more realised and engaging. Planting the seeds to a much larger universe that, sadly, we might never be able to see...Nevertheless, I must admit the movie is not innocent of some bigger mistakes regarding mostly sound design and music choices, dragging out of some plot elements and unpolished CGI. For the latter, I will admit I am not fully aware of how much time, money or manpower the team in charged of finishing the \"snydercut\" had so I would waive this complaint and perhaps praise the work done if such resources were indeed lacking. The horrible CGI moustache was fixed and the color correction of all the scenes and the final battle are on point and pleasantly welcomed.The movie takes its time in enjoying the moments. So much so that it gives a feeling of slow-pace that drags the movie sometimes. The pacing suffers from all the sequences the director wanted to include, some even rendering irrelevant or repetitive by trying to show too many \"angles\" or \"reactions\" to a particular event. For instance, there are ways to convey the emotional status of a character in a certain moment but once this is established, recreating itself by providing more shots conveying the same message to the audience may seem unnecessary. It almost feels like all the deleted scenes where added to the movie trying to enrich the story and it indeed does, but it however caused the runtime to grow and made it so the audience kept wondering when we'll get back to the main plot.But the dragging of the runtime seems so due to the fact that the movie crams a lot into it and with reason. Who knows when a director would be given a chance like this to tell the original 2 part story he originally wanted to make. I'm glad he put all his ideas in and to have them so cohesively spread out and placed on the movie. However, the scale of the movie was too grand to not be able to avoid having as many exposition scenes as it ended up having. And this comes down to perhaps the biggest problem of this movie and really the DC movie universe: it wanted to run before I knew how to walk.They were pretending to make their Avengers (2012) without putting in the work of fleshing out each individual character (and their own world building) in their individual movies and building up the mystery or the stakes. So many character personality changes or decisions feel rushed and unearned because of that, we feel like we don't know this character or perhaps, we don't know this particular version of the character. And I would say some scenes Whedon added did help flesh out the relationships between two characters that are a bit left out in this version to leave room for the new. Which in the long run it's the smarter decision, trying to provide each character of their due time to flesh them as much as they can. If only they had taken their time to make each individual movie or start small and they call in their Thanos' world-ending plot. I sincerely like the Justice League team of heroes more than the Avengers in the comics and animated shows, but so far it has been hard for me to root for the new Justice League live-action. However, had this cut of the movie, this vision, made it out there and succeeded; that could have changed.Nevertheless, my biggest problem with the movie is, surprisingly, the sound design.... I have no idea who was responsible for the music choices and soundtrack on this cut of the movie, but it is simply ludicrous. Epic shots of badass characters are given slow-paced music, the same clip of the musical cues/themes are played over and over and over again when a certain character comes into a shot and finally, a great majority of the original themes composed by Danny Elfman and/or Hans Zimmer are present. I wasn't expecting the \"rehashed\" version of the Batman 1989 theme he composed for Batman nor Superman's, but for instance the flash theme is nowhere to be found and instead replaced by an epic orchestral music that doesn't break the tone of the scene but simply renders it monotonous by matching it to the rest of the soundtrack. Sure, the Wonder Woman theme is played, as well as the Man of Steel theme, however the very same clips or parts of the themes are reused shamelessly in different scenes and it simply feels like they didn't use these soundtracks at all. They own Wonder Woman and Man of Steel, why not make use of those soundtracks? It drains out the uniqueness of each character interaction as these are not given a particular cue.IN CONCLUSION -- This version of Justice League is a love letter to the fans and the amount of world building and craftmanship displayed and shown by everyone involved is comendable. It is game changing to see a director be given a chance to make their original vision and to see the result be so satisfying. Unlike the 2017 version, this version I would rewatch in the future as it's engaging, epicly proportionate and filled with better-fleshed out characters and amazing cinematic shots. Lastly I would say that the \"midcredit scene\" is WAY too long to be included in the movie and way too enticing to the audience as it leaves you wanting more... I don't know what is WB's plans for the DC Universe, but it's a shame not to have seen what this original version could have lead to...", "What a great soundtrack.": "The most amazing soundtrack I've heard in a long time. With my own home theater and the sound loud, I got goosebumps many times. To be seen and heard again soon.", "Best DC MOVIE EVER": "Ohh man!! This is one of the best DC MOVIE EVER and things are explained more in detail \ud83d\ude0d", "Absolutely ridiculous...": "Illogical, cinematically pretentious and so boring, turned off after an hour.", "Exhausting and boring at the same time": "The movie is 4 boring hours. Most of the movie is in slow mo and drags horribly.", "One of the Greatest and Most Impactful Superhero Movies I've Ever Seen": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is easily one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. Its four-hour run time may seem a daunting task to overcome initially, but rest assured, it'll be the fastest four hours of your life. ZSJL takes its time to flesh out every character, including Steppenwolf, who went from being a disabled Thanos parody to a genuinely gripping and sympathetic villain. The action does not disappoint, and Junkie XL's score is perfectly matched to every breathtaking scene. After seeing this movie, I can only hope and pray that there's still a chance of restoring the Snyderverse.", "I didnt expect to like it": "I didn't like the original Justice League. I didn't plan on watching this version, but I heard positive things online and being a fan of Comic Books and DC I decided to watch it. It's the same movie as the 2017 version, but with more context and it makes more sense. Lots of unnecessary scenes (It's 4 hours!), but I watched it more like a miniseries so it didn't bother me. I've also heard complaints about some of the color and CGI, but in B&W (I watched the \"Justice is Grey\" version) it looks rly good. Flash is still annoying, just not as much. I laughed harder at the ridiculous Mercedes product placement than most of his lines. I actually cared about Cyborg this time and the villain (although forgettable) has motivation now. The last 20 minutes or so of the epilogue really sucked tho, and was the first time I just wanted to turn off the movie and be done. 8/10\nIdk about restoring the Snyder-Verse, but after this I at least want a comic run to finish the story.", "ANOTHER LEVEL": "This is the real deal, Justice league that was released in 2017 is just a trash in front of this.I really appreciate zack snyder for showing us the best logical and iconic version that he made.", "The version that should have been released in the first place": "I really enjoyed Zack Snyder's version of Justice League much, much, better.First and foremost, Cyborg finally gets much needed, fleshed out character development which truly brings out his importance to the team and basically the entire film. This is huge. This is major. This is a massive aspect of the movie that was completely sabotaged by Joss Whedon on the first try.Second, Zack Snyder's Steppenwolf is much more threatening, as a villain should be, and his motives are made clearer. His story arc has a lot more substance compared to Joss Whedon's film, and the introduction of Darkseid is exactly what the fans wanted all along. Zack Snyder understood this from the get-go and successfully delivers.Also, the action sequences are just plain awesome, with every hero making excellent use of their powers. Add in the Snyder touch, and you get pure fun, breath-taking sequences with nothing short of summer blockbuster vibes. Personally, I thought Wonder Woman and Batman were the most fun to see on screen.Joss Whedon's version of Justice League was a complete mess and Warner Bros should have been more respectful of Zack Snyder's work instead of handing it off to someone else. Luckily, the fans helped to turn things around and the Snyder Cut is here.Over all, this is the version that should have been released in the first place. It's the better movie. I wish I could have seen this in theaters.", "Wish we could've got this from the beginning!": "Now I know it's not a perfect movie but I gave it a perfect review only cause there's two movies out there of almost the same movie(notice I said \"almost\") but comparing them both, this one knocks out the whedon involved one out of the park and into the trash! Even though it's long and some parts are not necessary(like the ladies singing while aquaman swims away) it still such a very good movie and an excellent continuation of the Snyderverse. I'm so sad that it's ending here. I really wish it wasn't and we at least could see him finish his vision but at least we got this. I've watched it 4 times already, would watch it more but again it's 4 hrs long. And honestly I can't even watch the other one anymore. I tried after watching this one twice just to compare and just found myself forcing to finish it, when that one is two hours long! So yes it's really that good.", "Even worse than your average comic book movie in that it goes on forever": "After the death of Superman Batman sets out to form a coalition of superheroes: the Justice League.For the most part, your average modern superhero story: minimal plot, heaps of CGI and an attempt to cram as many superheroes, and supervillains, into the character list as possible.This film, however, is even worse than those already-boring films in that it is about twice the length. So much for \"if you can't make a good movie, make a short movie\".", "4 Hours of Super Hero Epic": "Definetly better than studio cut. Hard to watch because of its running time at once so you may want to split it into 4 episodes mini series.", "This is what we wanted..": "This is it. This is far better than the theatrical release. You simply won't miss any point that you've missed watching Theatrical Justice league. Give characters more of their story specially new ones like Cyborg and Flash. And connects all the points to make it a Fantastic release. Warner Bros studio should stop messing around with these movies. Give movie makers more freedom. THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED BUT WE WANT MORE. Bring back SNYDERVERSE.", "It's a massive upgrade...": "... that being said, it's not anywhere near perfect.Every single character gets the depth that they so desperately lacked in Josstice League. Cyborg was annoying in the 2017 version, but here he gets a really heart warming, and heartbreaking, story.The Themyscira scenes were brilliant, and much better than what Wonder Woman showed.Now to the things I didn't like. And people will most likely disagree.Wonder Woman is supposed to be a beacon of hope, a hero that saves people etc. etc. And she does save people, she also casually kills people infront of children.Flash runs around and is left doing practically nothing but run throughout more than half of the movie.The length. I know, I know, people will disagree. But it's just over 4 hours long. Why? Even though the movie does a much better job at building the characters, compared to Josstice League, the movie is such a damn drag. There are thousands of films out there that build characters with depth and emotion without needing 4 hours for it. I think that's why Justice League never worked in the first place. Half of the characters didn't have their own solo movies. That's why Aquaman in this film feels very different from the Aquaman in his own solo movie.I love DC, and I do think that this movie is vastly superior to Josstice League, BUT, it's not without major flaws. You should watch it though.", "Epic from beginning to end!": "I saw the original JL when it came out in 2017. I was to say the least. Very disappointed. In fact the only scene that moved me was the scene near the beginning with the backing track \"Everybody Knows\" . Which maybe was Snyder I don't know. Anyway it left me feeling empty with so many unanswered questions...Then came the Snyder Cut. OMG!!!From the opening scene and the soundtrack to the new added footage and character development I found myself asking over and over?? Why on earth did Joss Whedon leave all this out? Even the 1st time we see Wonderwoman enter through the doors and save those little kids I had chills.For me this was a completely different movie from the 1st one. No cheesy one liners. All the heroes are totally badass. Even Barry Allen as in the 1st movie Joss Whedon made him seem a bit of a scaredy cat...not a hero. In this he definitely is a real hero with the courage and selflessness that is needed to save lives!Please do not think this is just the 1st movie with added footage. Even though it is in a way...its an entirely new movie. Different lighting. More characters. More battles. More tension. Much more emotionally moving. I have watched this 5 times. Yes 5 times all the way through. I didn't even do that with Endgame.... So that should tell you something.I can only rate this 10/10 on here but its definitely an 11/10 for me!", "Satifies the fans but not for general audience": "As a non comic book follower I feel the movie to be far more superior than its 2017 counterpart but still its far from a 10/10. It wouldn't have done much to DCEU as a whole even if it were released in 2017. Really disappointed with the fact WB intended to go with the 2017 version instead of this. Admire Zack Snyder and all the fans who brought the studio to its knees.", "We did it guys!": "Exhilarating from minute 1. Totally epic full of mythology, 4 hours of awesomeness. It has its faults, but they're easy to overlook with such sheer ambition of Zack Snyder showing up in every frame. Solute to you man, you did it.", "A huge pay-off to the DC cinematic universe": "With a plot that actually makes sense, has a very good flow and few to none forced parts, I find this a very pleasant movie to watch, even with a 4-hour runtime. All of the main characters matter and would have had an even bigger impact, had there been a dedicated movie to each one. Steppenwolf looks marvelous and all of his (and other villains'!) fights look incredible. The visual changes (or should I say \"restorations\") were a \"must\" for the overall tone of the movie and so was (the majority of) the CGI. I hope the \"Snyder-Verse\" actually continues, as this movie was more than promising.", "Meh": "Tbh musics were so bad but movie was great. Black superman was beast. In the last scene i thought we're gonna see \"She is the key!\" thing though.", "Best DC movie EVER!!!": "The way Zack Snyder did justice to all the characters and showed their story one-by-one in a very understanding and mature way was like MAN, HOW ARE THIS GOOD?.Thanks Warner Bros, you finally heard the fans and gave us the best version of the movie and I hope you #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.Thanks friends.", "Thoroughly enjoyable": "As this film is just short of 4 hours long, we watched this over 2 evenings, which worked well for us. Full of action and an easy to follow storyline, this appealed to adults and teenagers alike. As always, Batman was brilliant. I loved The Flash and look forward to seeing him again, and Wonder Woman was so much better than in her stand-alone films. The only disappointment was the appalling cgi on WW's planet and I was outwardly cringing when the Amazonians were jumping on and off horses.", "Wonderful!!": "Wow, the new additions to the Cyborg subplot was great, and all the new footage adds so much depth. Such a HUGE improvement!!", "VISUALLY STUNNING": "I just love the visual and cinematography in this movie especially with the 1.33:1 or 4:3 aspect ratio. It's immersive, beautiful, and more cinematic than the 2017 version. Watching it in IMAX theater would be a dream come true for me. It's a shame that the 2017 version is still exists. Unfortunately, the only thing I can remember from it (2017 version) is the bad stuff because there's tons of it. I wish they would just remove it from existence.", "The Film that always should have been": "Almost everything good everyone else has said about this movie is accurate, so there isn't much for me to add beyond that this is film we absolutely should have gotten.It only loses one star because of the involvement of a certain monstrous human being, even if she's only in it briefly (*cough* Amber *cough*), sometimes separating the art from the artist is just too difficult.The only reason I'm walking away disappointed is because I know we won't get all the amazing concepts and characters that this movie has teased us with. Martian Manhunter doesn't exist in the josstice league, cyborg's awesome backstory is just ether there, and Wonder Woman has some serious issues with rape in WB canon.The absolute worst thing about this film is simply that it isn't canon, which is the greatest compliment that I can think to give.", "It's Awesome.": "Great to see the Justice league.After the movie, it's feel like to me that wow .What a movie!", "The movie that was stolen from US!!!": "Justice is here!!! And we needed this film! Go and watch it and don't let this so call review from people that is never satisfied keep you out of having your own views. The movie is really something different and refreshing from the monstrosity that we got from Joss and the people from the studio at that time......and Now the future holds in the past!", "Marvelous": "I don't have words to express this movie.\nIt was wonderful to watch. Worth every penny.\n10 out of 10\nThank you Mr. Zack Snyder for this wonderful masterpiece.\nHands down", "Infinitely bigger and better than the Whedon disaster": "This movie is actually also way better to the umph degree than any marvel movie to come out since civil war. Into the spiderverse and doctor strange were also amazing but this zac snyder justice league is just plain and simple epicness more than 90% of marvel movies. Which is insane for me to admit being a ultra bias marvel fan. The jizz Whedon version is such garbage.", "Best Superhero movie": "Ignore the haters. Ignore the marvel enthusiasts. zack Snyder's Justice League is better than all the marvel movies combined. Each character had a substantive character arc; unlike marvel movies that are geared towards more action and silly jokes, the justice league is a lot more relatable and realistic. The action and music is magnificent. Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman actually have important roles in the movie. The 4 hours do not seem that long at all. I really wish Zack Snyder comes back to direct the future justice league movies. Warner bros need to grow a pair and let this man make the movies according to his vision.", "A testament to all comic book films.": "To keep it simple, every aspect of this film is better than the 2017 catastrophe. Characters are given backstories and motives (Steppenwolf finally has a reason why he is attacking earth), the visuals are superior, and there is no cringy humour. The 4 hour runtime may feel long, but personally, it did not affect my experience. Zack Snyder has given one of the best DC films in recent memory and is unfortunate that WB will unlikely continue his vision. Overall, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a major improvement over Josstice League that all fans of the DCEU and comic books should feel satisfied about. And on a final note, Darkseid's appearance is badass!Grade: A-", "DC is back": "I really liked this movie (and this is coming from a Marvel fan). Almost everything about it was great. I would've preferred to have shown Darkseid be more threatening, because honestly Steppenwolf looks and acts way more threatening than him. I'm still sorry to say but I still don't like the Jared Leto's Joker very much. And there's some parts where CGI looks off but I don't really care about that because there's even points in marvel where CGI is off. I grew up with the animated series of Justice League and I love this adaptation of the movie.", "Better CGI and longer duration make the difference": "Zack Snyder's Justice League Movie manages to make a good junction of the heroes of the DCEU, without losing script coherence, The CGI is very good and the director's vision corrects the mistakes of the 2017 version without putting others in place. The soundtrack is good and there are few scenes that are lost throughout the story, such as the Flash with Iris, the plot of the villains (Darkseid and Steppe Wolf) is very well presented and he has several hooks for a possible sequel.", "It amazes me how much WB and Whedon butchered Zack's Vision": "Nearly every scene Snyder did in the original Justice League movie was either toned down or drastically changed for the worse. This 4 hour long runtime allows for much needed character development for not just the heroes but the villains as well. Every JL member was more complex, had more of a purpose in the film, and connected with each other in a way that made them feel like an actual team, a feeling that was completely absent before. Even the big bad was improved in terms of both a motive and visual standpoint. Zack Snyder's amazing eye for action doesn't miss a beat here and the ending will leave you hoping for a follow up. Went in expecting a good movie after the abomination that was the original Justice League, came out praying for a sequel to happen in the future.", "Finally true JUSTICE": "This is a Masterpiece of cinema.\nOne of, if not, The best CBM's of all time.Zack Snyder proving his critics wrong yet again!Fantastic story, beautiful cinematography, beautiful soundtrack.

Not one minute of it is boring or wasted, everything seems to be going at the right pace. Everything that seemed rushed or unexplained, made sense here. There is so much backstory, which has a big impact on the overall plot.In the original movie there were so many cases of \"wait, why is this happening?\" or \"how did it jump from there to here so quickly\", etc. But here there was none of that.I enjoyed every minute of it, watched in two days (for obvious reasons) and it was a really good movie.Now I really wish there were 2 sequels made, because this is something worth making. It's so different from the average \"feel good superhero movie\" and it feels like a breath of fresh air.Good job Zack Snyder, great job all the fans! This was worth the wait!", "Amazing!": "This movie is amazing! Once you start watching it, you just can't stop. You just want more.... Totally worth the wait!", "Close to perfect": "Snyders materpiece !? Only the story of the motherboxes is somwhat silly. Otherwise perfect cast and the story flows nice. Nice action pieces with a sence of real weight in the most intense set pieces. Good character building overall especially with Cyborg .

A big Thank you to all behind this movie, so much fun !!", "They both suck": "Monsterverse, snyderverse. Who gives a sh**? They both suck. I did like how Steppenwolf was up updated. Effects on him were great. The visuals for the rest of the movie are sooo \"video gamey\" and not at all up to par with its Marcel counterparts.The real problem with this and the theatrical version (and most of the DCEU) is pacing. 4 hours? The entire 1st hour was a snooze-fest.And is with the ending? The whole Bruce Wayne dream sequence had me so confused. It would have been more well received as an after credit scene.No. Just NO! DCEU needs to start all over again. The cast is great. The direction, production, VE, artistic everything is just so OFF it doesn't do the comics 'JUSTICE'. And after the huge let-down and absolute drivel that was WW84 (the first Wonder Woman was the best movie of the DCEU so I had high hopes) IM OUT! I won't be participating anymore.", "True Justice League": "I was so happy to finally watch this and was very impressed with seeing the true version of this movie come to life. It's a significant setup from the hacked Up and slapped together original. All the heroes got more time to shine and the way they came together made more sense. There was more action scenes and subtext which helped tell a better sorry. I really liked it. I still am not a fan of this version of Flash and there was still too much cgi and some parts looked ugly but that's not picking. Watch this.", "The True Vision Restored!": "After a long time coming of not believing this would ever happen, I'm so happy to say I wanted to cry tears of joy based on how much I really enjoyed this film. While basic plot of the story is pretty much the same, it's an entirely different film in tone, atmosphere, scope, and depth. For it's crazy runtime, it flew by and I didn't want it to end.Each character is given greater depth this time around, action scenes were off the charts awesome, musical score is on point, I really don't have many negatives about the film.A few things didn't quite work for me as well as I wanted them to but it was a joy to watch and be so impressed by how epic and artistic this film actually ended up being.

Sure, the movie was pretty bad, but after hearing about all the behind-the-scenes trouble, I was thankful that we'd gotten a coherent film at all.Fast forward a year, and I hear rumors that Zack Snyder's version was drastically different from the one that came out. \"Well of course it was different, he probably had tons of bad ideas and was going off the deep end, like he already did multiple times with DC material,\" I thought to myself. \"It was good that WB replaced him. Hopefully they can just end this series soon, or reboot it into something actually enjoyable.\"Then I heard what the original ending for his Justice League movie was, and I was blown away. They lose, everyone dies, and The Flash has to enter the Speedforce to undo everything so they can save the world?!! And then, even after that happens, at the very end of the movie we see Darkseid order an invasion of Earth, so everyone is ultimately doomed no matter what. So so so so different (and much better) than what we saw in the released version.Suddenly, this project had my attention. It was so bold, so dark and interesting, that it was only something Zack Snyder could have pulled off. Then I also heard that Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter were in the film, Superman's suit was ACTUALLY black, and that the movie ran almost 4 hours long. Interest peaked.After having seen the movie, I now believe it is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time. It is the Lord of the Rings of comic book films. It's not perfect by any means, but for its entire 4 hour runtime, it is filled to the brim with wit, action, great character moments, and something that was sorely missing in the Whedon version... heart.This movie has so much heart. The moment I saw The Flash's introduction, and time slowed down while the song played, and he held Iris Weat in his arms, I fell in love with this movie. Even with double the runtime as the other version, it is paced SO MUCH BETTER. Each character has a chance to shine in this film. I could go on and on, but I'll leave it at that.8/10, beautiful movie. Hope we can see more of this soon.", "Snyder Cut, better in every way.": "I was one of many who watched the 2017 Justice League thinking it was very odd and also cringe worthy at times. Though Zack's name was on it, it felt completely different from his previous films.Snyder's Cut is everything that Justice League 2017 should have been. Characters have depth, including the villains, humor is actually funny, music is amazing, epic action scenes, and no obvious reshoots. For a 4 hour long film, it flows pretty well, of course there are a few scenes that could have been cut, but this is Snyder's holy grail. I understand that he wants to put everything he can into it, including a brand new Knightmare scene with Affleck's Batman and Leto's Joker. Which is amazing btw, but that's where the movie really started to feel like 4 hours, but luckily the movie is about over by that time. Overall, Zack Snyder's Justice League is an epic superhero film that blows the 2017 version out of the field and every way.", "Review": "Out of this world literally\nOut of this world literally", "Amazing. Rebirth of a franchise.": "I haven't seen a DC movie since the 1st Wonder Woman because of all the mixed reviews. Absolutely loved the way this story was told and the time spent on each character's development. The action scenes are unmatched in any other movie I've seen.My mind has been changed, keep it up DC!!!!!!!", "Extremely overrated": "I appreciate that Zack finally got to release his initial vision, but this cut is only slightly better than the 2017 cut.\nFirst of all, it's 4 hours long. It's a real slog to get through as a movie. Most people are going to need a break or 2. Zack had the advantage of a pandemic & was able to release the full 4 hours on HBO Max. However in a normal world, this would have still needed to be chopped in half to be suitable for cinema viewing & we would have still got something as similar to the 2017 cut.\nThe movie in general, is stuffed with unnecessary exposition, way too many slow motion scenes, many cringeworthy soundtracks & a pointless epilogue. Cut those things out & I would give it a better score.\nThe Flash & Cyborg have too much focus when they are the least interesting characters & least convincing actors. It needed more of the other 4 characters who have much more charisma. Stepenwolf still looks awful like a cartoon character. This cut does resolve some of the silly plot elements from the 2017 cut, however it opens up twice as many new ones. I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. Hopefully the fan boys can move on with their lives now, but I don't think they will.", "Justice for Snyder": "Zach Snyders Justice League is a vast improvement over the disaster that was the theatrical cut of this movie.I remember walking out of the cinema feeling utterly disappointed and baffled as to how, Zach Snyders already established world had been disregarded and disrespected, replaced with bad jokes and awful, pointless reshoots.Watching Zach Snyders Justice League shows he already had enough footage in the bag to make a decent 2.5 to 3 hour movie, with additional footage for maybe a future directors cut blu-ray down the line.It's a shame it happened the way it did. But we now have this 4 hour version which is just fantastic and I was amazed at how good it actually was.I have always been a fan of BVS and will always defend it to people who trash it. Yes it's somber and cynical, but in this particular world, that is where the characters are at. I love the MCU but this isn't the MCU and I don't want it to be the same, not even similar.Hopefully for Snyder (and fingers crossed, Cavill) the attention and praise this film is getting will show WB that Snyder had a vision that fans want to see, and they don't have to compete with Marvel. They should stick to the plan and do their own thing. 2 very different comic universes can coexist successfully in my opinion.I loved this film and can't wait to watch it again, I highly recommend it and give it 10 out of 10.I also recommend anyone who hasn't seen them in a while, to revisit Man of Steel and the Ultimate Edition of Batman V Superman.Well done Zach Snyder and kudos to WB for making it happen.", "Way better then the other one.": "Although this movie is 4 hours and a little too long for my taste it was wat better then the 2017 version.The action and battles were much better, also because its rated R and the plot was better as well.Almost every scene is different I just saw a few that was also in the 2017 version.", "Best superhero-movie ever!": "Simply put. After awful theatrical version of Justice League, I hoped and hoped we'll get to see THIS one. And we did! And it didn't disappoint. Everything is just great! Cgi, acting, violence, Steppenwolf that looks like a real threat this time. Eve.Ry.Thing!Forget Marvel. Forget Avengers. THIS is THE superhero-movie we needed!", "Best DCEU movie ever!!": "It was so epic even 4 hrs felt short.\n#Restorethesnyderverse\nHope we will get JL2 and JL3", "This version of Justice League is the best DC heroes movie so far": "This version of Justice League is the best DC heroes movie so far. It presents a complete story and stays true to the original comics and cartoons: tense and dark atmosphere, each of the heroes playing an important role in the story and having their own story told, incredible visual effects, and that nostalgic feeling of happiness seeing the whole team together fighting the (amazing) villains to save our planet. Might not be perfect but it totally delivers what fans who grew up around these heroes always asked for: an exciting and original movie.", "Much better": "At 4 hours long this film is perfect to be watched at home spread out on sofa, have to say I enjoyed this a whole lot more character exploration , maybe this might make them revisit the other sequels that were planned", "Better than the theatrical version for sure.": "Really this is a solid 8/10, there are definitely plot holes, cheese ball moments that could have been taken out, a blaring ominous church chorus theme that blasts way too many times, some spotty special effects at moments. I'm adding a bonus point for just how impressive it is that this even got made to begin with, HBO your value and gigantic balls will take my money forever if you keep this up. A 4 hour movie would not have worked in the theater but perfect for a binge at home. The character development, improved character models, added action sequences and just overall better editing make this a complete film. There were moments I actually felt emotions, versus just another loud blow up movie with one liners like the theatrical cut. Snyder is a legend.", "Well Done! Watch This, it's Well Worth it.": "Amazing movie, my heart felt appreciation to all involved, especially Zack Snyder.Well cast, well acted, well shot, awesome effects. Also my wife and I have watched it twice so far, and plan to watch it more. This epic movie could not have been done in 2 hours or less, and be coherent. That is why it did not perform at the box office as they had hoped. The original release was sloppy and full of holes, as with most DCEU so far.", "Slow, Self-Indulgent, Repetitive and Sappy": "This movie is a perfect mirror for the ego of a director who sees the need to put his own name into the title of a movie. This is a director stroking his ego by turning a 1:45 movie into 4:02. Half of this movie could easily have been left on the cutting room floor, and the end product would have been far more watchable. What could have been a good story became absolute drudgery in the extreme. I couldn't imagine having to ever sit through this vivid example of directorial self-gratification again.", "Gives the Justice League depth and life": "I'm blown away at how different and what a better version this movie was. Synder's cut really added the character depth and emotion that the original lacked. I was particularly impressed with how the added story of Cyborg and Steppenwolf really changed the feel of the movie too. I was far more invested in Cyborg's character, and Steppenwolf went from being a boring generic rule the world villain to having drive behind him.The cheesy jokes are gone which I really hated in the original, especially Batman's. In Whedon's cut I felt Batman was pretty useless / powerless and was there to just make an appearance and have some crappy one liners. In this cut his presence really makes an impact.I really liked the movie's ending too, very different to what was in the original. This movie has me invested in the DC universe again. I didn't care before if there was a Justice League 2, now I really hope there is!", "A significant improvement": "Let's clear up that I didn't hate the original; but when you put all your best heroes together and only produce 'half decent', that's as good as failure.The Snyder Cut is a much more rounded and satisfying movie. The characters get more development and the story gets more attention.The 4hr run time is an investment and you can see that, but for the studio, this would have been two movies.But it's an investment we'll made. It's just a shame that we are unlikely to ever see where the story would have went!It's still not as well developed as the MCU but it's clear that they could have done better without the studio interference.", "Outstanding!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League makes the Joss Whedon edit look like a children's movie. Continues the story with much more detail and we finally the Martian Manhunter.", "From one of DC's Worst to one of their best: The Snyder Cut is worth it for fans": "For anyone who's tracked the drama surrounding Zack Snyder's personal cut of 2017's Justice League, you know that for a little over 4 years, fans on social media have bombarded WB, DC, the cast themselves, and anyone who will listen with the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut tag. People repeated it so much that many, including myself, started to mock the hashtag and the idea that this alternate version existed, and if it did, that it could be much better.2016's BvS (or B v Mess as I call it sometimes) had a director's cut of its own that improved things only slightly. It was a few minutes of extra footage here and there that clarified things slightly in a still-messy and sloppy movie, so I was skeptical that a cut of Justice League could really be that much better, but I do have to say I was wrong. Warner Brothers and their decision to hire Avengers director Joss Whedon to cut, re-shoot, and cobble together a new version was a huge mistake that ended up being responsible for the confusing, rushed, and uneven end product Justice League 2017 was. Situations like these really show you how much studio interference and editing can completely compromise someone's artistic vision.The Snyder Cut isn't perfect: it's an understatement to say that it's too long clocking in at an insane 4 hours and 2 minutes. If you're not a comics fan or superhero movie fan, don't want to see Justice (pun intended) for these characters on film, or haven't even seen the original for reference as to the changes made with this version, you can probably skip this extended cut entirely. The choice of music in some of the Snyder Cut is questionable, and Snyder really likes slow motion music-montage sequences, and there's too many of those peppered throughout. Too much slow-motion in general, but then again, this is a Zack Snyder movie. Without the slow motion, maybe the Snyder Cut would be 20 minutes instead.The good outweighs the bad, though, as the extended running time explains character motivations, sets up events, and raises the stakes and importance of nearly every situation in the movie. In the case of characters like Cyborg played by Ray Fisher, we actually get to see what he can do as an actor. His character development isn't diced down into a short file read on a hologram, but instead is crafted into a fairly touching and tragic tale between him and his family. The Snyder Cut shows us how he feels about becoming a cybernetic person, gives us more details about his powers, and makes him a more important and worthwhile addition to the movie. The Flash is also vastly improved, with Whedon's ineffective one-liners removed, replaced with a better story arc connected to his father and humorous remarks that suit the tone of the movie more. The action is better, the team works together more coherently, the visuals are better, and it delivers an overall more satisfying experience.Having seen both, I can really see that the theatrical version really favored one-liners and quick jokes over storytelling. Humor is fine, Marvel makes it work, but they lay the groundwork for telling a story, they don't sacrifice necessary story scenes for stupid jokes. You can really get a sense for how worthless much of what Whedon added in was, gags like Flash falling on top of Wonder Woman in a sexually suggestive way, removing the Justice League planning a battle strategy in place of another gag, delaying the team's rescue of innocent people in favor of a gag, and removing some of Flash and Cyborg's best scenes for gags involving Superman saving more people than the Flash in the finale. The perfect version of Zack Snyder's Justice League would actually be a third cut of the movie that reduced the runtime down to a normal movie length: 2 hours, 45 minutes or so at most. If they could keep the better story and characterization seen in the full cut in a trimmed version, then that would've done well in theatres and elevated the DC brand. As it stands, it seems like the Snyder Cut might be too little (or too much) too late. Since it's on only one streaming service and so overwhelmingly long, many might not see what was intended from the start with this movie, and it might not make an enough of an impact in a movie franchise that's had so many failures, flops, and disappointments.", "Better than theatrical, not the best movie in the world ffs": "Is this movie better than the theatrical version? Yes absolutely, although the bar was set as low as it can get.\nIs it the best movie ever made? No, just another Zack Snyder \"every other scene slow motion\" movie that looks kind of cool every now and then.\nIs it a decent movie? Yes.\nDo I now want to see a sequel? You bet.. and that's really the thing that matters most.This is a more complete movie and the storyline fits way better in this, which doesn't come as a surprise at 4 hours long, but it doesn't leave you thinking that there is something missing from the storyline as much as before.\nFlash and Cyborg get more development as characters and you don't feel like they are just there to make some of the scenes and story make sense which is great.Overall this version is considerably better but far from flawless. A lot of the previous things that pissed me off are still there, but since the storyline is more fleshed out, the movie manages to capture the audiences better and you kind of forget about the flaws. It allows you to focus more on the story and character development and allow yourself to be entertained which is exactly what Marvel has done so well in the past.I had absolutely no hopes for this movie or the DCEU in general but I can honestly say that this is the first movie that I have seen in the DCEU which leaves me wanting more. I want to see the story continue and for me, that's the most important thing.Well done Zack Snyder.", "What the fans and characters deserved": "After years of fighting, fans finally got what they wanted with Zack Snyders Justice League and shows that when a director is given the time, belief and support of a company, a film can achieve spectacular heights. This film is long, but at no points did I ever feel that I needed a break or that it actually felt like 4 hours. I was so engrossed with the story and the characters that time just flew by.It is sad we will never see the full story arc Snyder had intended however we can be happy that we got to see the vision he originally wanted for the characters.Each character is fleshed out and given the respect they deserve.It is a bittersweet end to Snyders run, and has left many wondering what could have been if studios didn't take so much creative control.", "A very expensive waste": "Seeds of doubt have been around since the debacle of Watchmen but proof positive was glaringly clear with Man of Steel & Batman vs Superman, Justice League was just the culmination of what real fans knew, but \"Justice League the Snyder cut\" makes it so abundantly clear he should never have been trusted with these characters or projects, it's clear that Snyder has his followers & those are what we see lauding his choice to destroy these characters, these are not Fans of the genre these are \"Snyder fans\" drooling & foaming at the mouth at how the characters have been \"dirtied\", corrupted for today's cancel culture youth, these are not portrayals of fan favourite heroes, heroes don't kill,heroes don't stand around perving on women while an out of control vehicle is left to indiscriminately mame & kill people, Snyders idea of heroes does because he has no idea what a hero is, which is why his vision of the DCU is nothing more than unimaginative garbage. The Snyder cut is literally stitched together \"music video scenes\" more poses than actual action & more slo-mo scenes than any other film in existence, each scene highlighted with ott dramatic music, the story /plot is nonsensical, the casting of each character is as ridiculous as the movie itself. Justice League the Snyder cut is boring, it is dreary,it is the culmination of a man that has no vision, no imagination, no ability to differentiate between good & bad, the action scenes are tedious & they lack the \"heroism\" the characters would portray, this movie is nothing more than eye candy for the gamer generation. If the DCU is ever going to be a player in the movie business it needs to never allow Snyder near another of its projects otherwise \"Wonder Woman 84\" will be the best it ever gets & the entire world knows now how bad that is. This gets a very generous 2 stars for the excellent J K Simmons & Jeremy Irons.", "Just no": "This is like a 4hrs long slow-motion deodorant commercial for Jason Momoa.", "A Total Blockbuster": "Zack Snyder again showed his proficiency in terms of making good movies. Prolonging it's running time did actual justice to the movie as many important details got highlighted. A total treat for the eyes", "Best director's cut ever": "New and improved. Wow , so much more story so much more emotion. It was inspiring and inspirational. Excellent job. Good show.", "Simply Amazing!": "Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. As an audience you connect with the story, the dark theme worked coz Zack made it work\nDC proves yet again why they are better than MCU - Marrbell Cr@p Utopia.Great story telling and the changes made da whole experience so much better.", "Now THAT, is an awesome superhero movie!!!": "This perfectly explains that, if given independence on screen time and budget, a visionary director can make the same material go from average to a masterpiece.\nThis is a whole new movie, nothing like the previous justice league. The 4 hours didn't feel long at all instead I wish he could have added more and made it 5 hours long.\nWatch it, it's a wonderful superhero movie.", "Just Lame": "This movie just seemed lacking, and in parts it was just dull, slow and boring. The potential was there, but it just did not ignite my interest. A lame attempt.", "Yes!": "Truly a rewarding and immensely satisfying experience. The runtime is used to the film's full advantage, providing an absolutely incredible amount of additional story and character depth that greatly expands on ideas and aspects only hinted at in the theatrical cut. The sheer scope and ambition of Snyder's vision is nothing short of epic and intoxicatingly immersive. For me, the four hours flew by, and it left me wanting more. Easily a monumental improvement.", "Restored my hope in Superhero movies": "When avengers end game finished I thought that would be it for the hero verse, this is on another level, there's isn't anything really to compare it to, to compare it to any marvel film would be wrong this is its own film it's own story not trying to be anything else but itself (unlike the first cut which was trying to cash in on marvels success) I would recommend watching Superman and BvS before this. Without spoiling anything the epilogue sequence has really restored my hope for whats next to come. Absolute 10/10", "What a masterpiece": "This movie doesn't feel like 4hrs, it's like watching a whole season in a matter of mins and you can't wait for a year to get the next season\nEven though the whole season was an introduction\nI know this was mostly shelved stuff, but ill repeat once more.DCU please get a new CGI team.\nI cringed when they called that giant blob Doomsday\nThe entire CGI set really drags down the goosebumps.\nLastly WB I'm not a businessman but please let Zack do his magic\nFirst, it was the movie now it's Green Lantern.\nseriously who leaked the movie anyways?", "A Vast Improvement From The Original": "We all know that Justice League (2017) had lots of production and post-production problems that led to the film ultimately failing on a critical level. Many of the original issues from the first movie have been fixed in this version. The pacing was probably the worst part about the 2017 version, but now Snyder has complete control, and such issues have been fixed at the cost to the runtime. Zack Snyder's Justice League is 4hrs long. It has plenty of content that the original was just missing. The long runtime is completely necessary in my opinion, as it adds more depth to the characters and it creates a better story. It does drag at certain points, but I think the pros outweigh the cons. The CGI has also been greatly improved. Steppenwolf actually looks decent and thankfully there's no more red background. There was some poorly added in green screen that is noticeable, but once again, the pros outweigh the cons.The bottom line is if the movie is good enough to warrant the 4hr runtime, and in my opinion, it is if you're a DCEU fan. This film is solely for the fans; there's not enough action in the film to entertain a viewer that wants to be entertained, but that should already be known. Anyway, I recommend the film to every fan who has not seen it; it's a solid superhero flick.", "By far the best movie by Snyder and one of the best superhero movie in recent time": "I'm not a huge fan of Snyder's works, i hate him for what he did with the movie Batman v Superman, so when I heard he was doing the JL movie i was furious and after seeing the 2017 version i thought anything good in that movie was whedons contribution and Snyder ruined the movie. But after watching the Snyder cut i realized i was so wrong.\nThe Snyder cut is 4 hour long and Snyder managed to make that 4 hour pretty interesting and engaging i watched the movie twice and I did not fast forward even for a minute. The characterisation, the build up, the development of the plot, the action sequences everything was perfect. The batman charecter is much more developed and behaves more like the comic book version same with the case of flash, cyborg and wonder woman.\nOverall Snyder managed to bring out his best through the ZSJL.", "He promised to fix it. And he did.": "First of all, I'm a huge comic books fan. Read a lot of stuff starting with the very first Golden Age issues. But the thing is... I always hated DCEU. Aside from the Aquaman (James Wan was the only one who actually got it right in my opinion) and arguably the first Wonder Woman, it felt like a disaster. Take those Superman movies for example. Those were, like, the exact opposite of what superheroes are about. Not like there are any borders or laws in comics, of course, it's just... those movies felt like the most important thing was missed. And the original Justice League? It was just stupid.So... let's just say my expectations here were incredibly low. I actually considered skipping this version entirely. Because wasting four more hours of my life on DCEU didn't really feel like a good idea to me. Guess what? I'm glad I gave it a chance. Even though I can't even say I liked a single movie from Zack Snyder (no, not even the most popular ones), what we have here is a rare case when a person stood for his promise. He promised to fix it? And he did. Simple like that. I totally enjoyed the new movie and not only because it was the first time I've seen it in 4K with the HDR.First of all, the scale is much bigger now. The main story was heavily altered and, well, it's more like a different movie entirely. Remember what MARVEL did in their Avengers: Infinity War? That's pretty much what we have here now. In other words, Justice League is not a stand-alone movie anymore. It's \"the beginning of the end\". Which, obviously, is supposed to happen in the Flashpoint movie. You've read some comics or at least seen The CW's TV show, you know the drill, but honestly, the first look of it that you'll have during the epilogue of this movie? It's kinda fantastic. It's very interesting and everything works perfectly. Yes, even Jared Leto's Joker. Totally hated him before, but here? Surprisingly awesome. The writing, the acting, the directing... it's all here. Just like we all wanted.Same thing with pretty much everything else. For example, the scrip actually does make sense now. And as the result, the movie actually makes you care and is interesting to watch. Not only because of tons and tons of action. The characters got more backstory and Cyborg, for example, isn't a shallow tool anymore. Seriously, who cared about Ray Fisher's character in the original version? He was nobody. Well, he isn't anymore. Like I said, the new script does make you care and it feels great.I also want to praise the balance. A bit too late, but DCEU finally found its perfect balance between drama and inspiration. The new Justice League is dark enough to give you that certain DC vibe, but at the same time the movie doesn't try to break you. It's here to inspire. I mean, let's be honest. Superheroes exist to inspire. Not to steal the last will to live you still have in you. This movie? It got it. I can't freakin' believe it, but it... freakin'... got it.Of course, I can't say that it's a perfect movie now. Some things from the original version are still here to bring it down a bit. For example, Barry Allen is still a comic relief character. He's also fixed quite a lot by the new developments (didn't hate Ezra Miller's character nearly as much as I did in the original version), but still, it's Jar Jar Allen. And it's still a humiliation. I mean, you can't just take one of the most iconic heroes who sacrificed himself during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and turn him into Jar Jar Binks just because you feel like your script needs a comic relief character. It feels wrong. Especially for comic books readers. And the new movie still does suffer from that. Again, not nearly as much as before and I even liked the new scenes with Ezra, but... yeah. It's still wrong.All in all, though, we finally got ourselves the movie we deserved back in 2017. If DCEU was like this since very beginning? It'll be entirely different story for us all. And it's kinda sad, you know? I mean, looking back, thinking about just how many things went wrong, while clearly, they can fix them when they want to. On the other hand, if that's how they're about to end the story in Flashpoint? I must say, I'll remember DCEU in a good way. The superhero feeling is back to the DCEU. And it feels great. Dixi.", "Good, not Great.": "Artistically done. Absolutely. The special effects are also very good. I have no problems with the movie. It simply wasn't anything more than a good movie. A lot of the DC characters to begin with have a sense of cheesiness whether it be their origin, or their costumes. The decision to put these characters in cheesy positions also doesn't work for me; ie the opening scene of Wonder Woman standing on a statue overlooking the city. Really? Why?", "The Justice League I've been waiting for since I was 7": "Truly epic and doesn't even feel like 4 hours. Incredible is one way to describe it. Give it a watch and see why.", "Sexy! Beautifully artistic!": "The first (probably only) 4 hour movie I've watched that is engaging and beautiful all the way through! I was a Marvel girl until this movie! Applause to you Mr. Synder. I loved the inspirational messages throughout as well!", "Thought it would be a different cut, was a different better movie": "Thought it would be a different cut, was a different better movie", "THE TRUE, REAL, ACTUAL MOVIE HAS ARRIVED.": "IT HAS ARRIVED.... The REAL, TRUE, ACTUAL, DIFINITIVE movie.......

This was the movie I was promised and Snyder delivered in more ways than one. Owners AT&T, Warner Media and Jason Kilar have every reason to be happy with there investment because it has paid off and I CANT WAIT FOR THEM TO GREEN LIGHT JL2 and 3 with or without WB. The fans and audience deserve part 2 and 3.As for the haters....well you had your movie in 2017 made SPECIFICALLY for you called Josstice League while Me and many other people have ours and its Zack Snyders Justice League. Go ahead haters down vote me, just proves me right and annoys you more, Deal With It.", "wow": "Wow.. within the first 1 hour, shoot, 30 min, this version already has more story and backstory than the first one had all the way through. Granted, there's an extra 2 hours in the entirety, but my gosh the story is much more interesting with certain things being explained and it not all being mashed into a \"superhero only\" flick. It's been humanized thankfully. I don't leave a ton of reviews, heck, I'm not even finished with it yet but had to say that. Things are making MUCH MUCH more sense and MUCH more interesting now.", "A Great Movie": "An extended cut from the original movie was needed. Personally I enjoyed every single minute even if it was 4 hours long but i think that some characters were not given the attention the deserved. For example the Flash had such little attention that you had to know the backstory to figure out what was going on with the Flash. Thankfully the Flash movie is coming out and the proper attention to the character will be paid. Except that the movie was GREAT.", "More cohesion and more emotion": "Yes, it is a long film, however I felt that breaking it into chapters gave it enough structure to either watch a chapter at a time or all at once. I chose to do the former.I don't want to ramble on because it has all been said already but I will say this version eclipses the cinema cut and pales it into insignificance with measured and intelligent story telling.The Amazons are incredible, Wonder Woman awesome, Supes is used sensibly, almost understated and Steppenwolf much more believable as the villain of the piece.Snyder should be left at the helm for the continuing development of this line of the DCU story.", "A vast improvement on the dose of Justice we were served in 2017, but still messy and flawed": "At the time of writing this film has an average score of 8.5/10 on IMDb which is rather ludicrous, and hopefully with more ratings a more balanced and more accurate score will emerge.Don't get me wrong I thought this film was perfectly fine, and much better than the mish mash Whedon / Snyder 2017 version. However, as this cut proves, a lot of the problems were deep seated and contained within Zack's vision, and were not the fault of Whedon and the various production issues.Given all the effort and hullabaloo surrounding this film, I still found it be incredibly messy and jumpy. The beginning of the film leading up to the moment when our heroes united was very choppy. It felt like we were getting excerpts from their solo films and the attempts to knit these together failed for me.There was always a lot of work to do introducing major new characters like The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman, and none of them came across well. Barry Allen was butchered, through no fault of Ezra Miller's. The scripted humour for his character just did not fly. Cyborg was decent, and the backstory we got was much better than the 2017 version, however I still didn't find myself connecting too much with him. To top it all off Aquaman was far too one dimensional, which is a shame as his solo outing proved that Momoa can inject real life and personality into this character.The ultimate problem with this film was that it was just too early in the DCEU to bring all of these characters together. No amount of editing or the four hour runtime could fix this.There were also some other problems with the more established characters. We didn't get enough of Batman doing cool Batman stuff (nothing came close to resembling the awesome warehouse fight scene of BvS). Wonder Woman also came across as one dimensional and hollow.Then there were the usual problems with a Snyder film. Far too much indulgent slo-mo and a bland, muted, and dark colour palette. I know some people really like this style but it just doesn't work for me.Now onto the positives, of which there are plenty. Firstly, Snyder managed to make a four hour film feel a lot shorter, and the pacing was decent. It never felt like a chore which long films can often feel like.I also thought the story was vastly better than the 2017 cut. It was given more time to breathe, and as a result the relationships between the characters had more depth and were more engaging.The plot also made more sense and, despite still being flawed was a more enjoyable watch. It had some great moments and we were allowed to explore the events that were unfolding in more detail which I enjoyed. It still wasn't amazing, and I think the DCEU will always have to grapple with the curse of Superman being so overpowered and being a get out of jail free card to overcome any adversary.A vast improvement on the 2017 version, but still flawed and messy. I think the film could have done with a bit more editing, trimming, and refining, but it was enjoyable to watch and is a decent comic book film. 8.5/10, I don't think, but well worth a watch for superhero fans.", "4 hours long": "It was good, maybe better than Marvel.\nIt was a lot better than the other Justice League movie.\nThe end credits were too much.\nDoes the director want more movies?\nThat epic fight scene with the gods, that was EPIC! The fights were so good! This really looked like and felt like a real comic book movie!", "Definitely an improvement over Whedon": "I wrote in the Whedon review that Superman felt out of place; well, he's no longer out of place in Snyder's cut. Pretty much all the complaints I had of him in Whedon's version have vanished in Snyder's cut:The most important complaint from the Whedon cut being that he seemed too OP & completely overshadowed the other members, which combined with his space-Jesus status made him completely obnoxious. In Synder's cut, he's still OP & still space-Jesus, but his OP-ness is not overshadowing the other members abilities and contributions, who also get to shine in the spotlights with their share of heroism. The team work feels much more balanced.The other big complaint I had with Superman was that in the Whedon, it seemed as though he was brought back wrong and was ax-crazy, then Lois Lane was heavy-handedly inserted into the story for no other reason than to bring him back. In the Snyder cut, Superman did not seem ax-crazy but extremely on edge because of his confusion about being brought back from death and his violence was provoked by Cyborg, who accidentally started the attack when he couldn't control his automatic self-defense system. Furthermore, we spend more time with Lois Lane in the Snyder cut and experienced her grief, so she did not feel forcefully inserted into the movie in the Snyder cut.Superman as guilt motivation of Batman also no longer seems shoehorned in the Snyder cut, but a logical follow up.Thank heavens the Snyder cut no longer had Superman make the condescending claim that he \"likes justice\". That, combined with portraying him as unquestionable light of the world while also beating the JL up, made him in the Whedon cut both jarringly hypocritical and obnoxious. In the Snyder cut Superman's portrayal was much more balanced, as Superman was still portrayed as hope, but at the same time also clearly as having the potential to be a threat.Other improvements from Snyder's cut include:No more oversaturated orange color!Overall better fleshed out characters and plot that make much more sense!No more jarring tonal clashes between humor and dark mood to give you whiplash. There is still humor and the occasional quip, but toned down and balanced with seriousness to suit the mood of the film. (I do like quip-y dialogue that Whedon is well-known for, but he inserted it so forcefully in a movie that already had established a very different tone under Snyder's direction that it very visibly clashed on screen in a very ugly way.)Whedon's sexist jokes with Wonder Woman were taken out!Much better cinematography, the scenes had way more atmosphere in them. (Whedon is really bad at this; he's better off delegated back to the small screen.)Action scenes are better!The \"I still like it\":I loved Aquaman and Wonder Woman bash bro team up during Whedon cut and I love their team up EVEN MORE now. They are excellent action bros.The bad:Snyder really should've left Martian Manhunter out of the movie. He adds zero value to it and as a serving of easter eggs was just obnoxiously in your face. In an already 4 hours long film, he is just too much.Luthor's escape from prison and yacht scene adds nothing to the plot, or the character development of the main characters or of the main villains. It's a tease of a sequel that will never come. Again, too much added in an already 4 hours long film.Some of the music seems really cheesy.I like the new lamentation chant of the Wonder Woman theme and for the most part I think it's cool, but in some scenes it seems misplaced and because the chant is so obvious and recognizable, it becomes jarring to the scene.The \"okay...\":Shiptease moment between Batman and Wonder Woman during the mouse scene makes me wonder if Snyder had planned to go the way of the early 2000s cartoon. Not necessarily bad, I don't mind it, but it kind of went nowhere.Joker dream scene. On the one hand, it gives Batman some extra depth and by appealing to the impact of Robin's death, but on the other hand, it might make an already 4 hours long movie feel overstuffed and doesn't add to the film's plot, but feels like a sequel hook.", "Justice has been made!": "The waiting was long but worth it Zack Snyder's Justice League is a surprise vindication with a mature approach to its superhero drama, better-realized antagonists, and improved action. A perfect adaptation for a DC ubiverse movie.", "Boring... nearly fell asleep a few times.": "The movie just dragged on and on and none of the characters were really engaging.It seems like the movie was made SSSOOO long just for the sake of making a long movie.So many scenes could have been left out cause they added nothing to the story and no one would have even noticed.", "Reboot this Crap": "With new Batman & Superman (plus the success of Joker) reboot the whole thing. Start over. All new characters. There is no coming back from this. The \"high review\" are bull. This makes no sense, had 40 unexplained plots, and forced twists that don't do anything. Ruin. Garbage. Terrible. Waste of 4 hours. Just reboot the whole thing, do it right.", "A Version of Justice League that I Can Love": "Zack Snyder's Justice League opens with the death of Superman in greater detail. His death triggers a reaction from the three mother boxes and Steppenwolf, one of Darkseid's servants appeared. After Steppenwolf retrieved the mother box from the Amazons, Queen Hippolyta sends a signal to Diana that he has returned. Diana and Bruce meet up to round up Barry Allen, Victor Stone and Arthur Curry to form the Justice League. However, the other three have their own problems to deal with before they can join for good.I prepared for this special release by watching all of the early DCEU films such as Man of Steel, the Ultimate Cut of Batman v. Superman, Wonder Woman and the theatrical cut of Justice League. Now it's finally here. There has always been questions to what Zack Snyder's version of the Justice League would be like. How different would the tone be? How would the characters act? Would there be any extra scenes? At a four hour runtime, this movie has become a comic book movie epic. There is so much to live up to. The question is, was this version worth spending time and money on?From the opening scene, Zack Snyder's Justice League goes into a completely different direction from the theatrical cut. Instead of the corny interview from Superman, we are treated to a harsher perspective on Superman's death. It is a heartbreaking scene and it sets the tone for the film. This is not going to be the MCU wannabe that Whedon's cut was. This was going to be a much darker, grittier Justice League.And that it is. Zack Snyder's Justice League is everything I wanted it to be and more. First of all, it fixed my biggest issue with the theatrical cut. The characters are infinitely better here. Cyborg in particular stands out as a character who loses so much and still ends up being a great guy. He gets much more to do and he has some sad moments as well. This movie delves into his past and his relationship with his father and does a great job at both. He feels very fleshed out now. Barry Allen is still the comic relief, but he is much more badass here and he is a bit more fleshed out. He gets an opening scene that establishes his clumsy, but good hearted nature, he seems more insecure this time and his relationship with his dad seems more serious. When it seems like he is outshined by everyone else, he gets the coolest moment at the end of the film making him just as important to the Justice League as everyone else. The biggest character improvement by a mile is Steppenwolf. In the theatrical Justice League, Steppenwolf was nothing more than a flat villain who had no other motive than take over the world. Here, he is actually a servant to Darkseid and he believes in what he is doing is right. He has a sense emotion and valor if that makes sense. Also, his design is still iffy, but his expressions are so much better. His eyes in one scene made for a powerful reaction and it alone gave this character more depth. I never thought that I would have a version of Steppenwolf that I liked in the DCEU, but here we are.The other members of the Justice League are solid as well, but those three are the standouts. Superman stands out too. He gets a little more motivation and it leads to a beautiful scene with him. Still, I am not a hundred percent sold on his revival. His dark suit is pretty cool though.Another big improvement is the action. This movie probably has some my favorite battle sequences in a comic book movie. The first action scene with Wonder Woman showed me that this film was going to have some epic extended fights and it did. The scene where Wonder Woman explains the war against the parademons and the alliance of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, the battle plays out without any interruption. The movie lets the scene speak for itself. Also, the movie is more bloody than the theatrical cut. Every single action scene is beautifully shot and edited. They flow so well and the camera work is dynamic. Not only that, they hit hard and they feel fast-paced. The visuals look polished compare to the other cut as well. The colors look great and the CGI and backgrounds look more believable. The only detraction from the visuals I can say is that the slow-motion can get excessive at times. It is used mainly in the first act, but it gets a little old after a while. Otherwise, the set pieces in this film are damn near perfect. Zack Snyder is known for crafty great action, but this movie has some of his best work yet.As for the tone, it is much darker than the original cut in theaters, but it also has a hint of optimism. The characters do not joke around aside from Barry Allen, but they are not as negative as they were in Batman v. Superman. They have hope that they can win as a team and they focus on getting to the point where they can fight Steppenwolf. Also, considering all of the stuff Cyborg went through with his mom and him getting revived in a weird way, it's hard not to feel bad for him. The story is much better paced and we get a sense of these characters this time around. The film takes the time to let us know who they are. Of course, the runtime helps. Steppenwolf is also a much bigger threat, making the stakes higher. Humor is still there, but it's few and far between and it is much better incorporated. The Flash is the only comic relief here and even he has some serious moments. Not even Aquaman has that many humorous moments. Superman does a complete one 180 from the theatrical cut. He is moody and strong. He is just there to do business. This tone works because it comes right after Batman v. Superman when everyone from that film were at pretty downer points by the end. This movie did not need to be happy and cheerful. It needed to raise the stakes.All that said, I do have a couple problems. I am a fan of the last 15 minutes. It has a cameo that introduces a character that I really like, but it is hard to get excited because I think this is Snyder's last DCEU film. Also, there is a cop out that is really frustrating to watch. The runtime is fine. The movie is four hours, but I could keep watching for another four. As cool as Jared Leto's Joker scene was here, he only gets one scene. J.K Simmons also only gets one decent scene as Commissioner Gordon before disappearing into the background. The last thing is that it feels kind of sad knowing that some of actors will never return and we will never get to see the rest of what Snyder had in store for this franchise.Love him or hate him, he was passionate about these films. He put a lot of effort into them both in the writing and visually. Not everything worked, but he got to create his own vision until Justice League. It is also sad knowing that Ray Fisher will not come back because of how he was treated. This movie proved that he would have been a great Cyborg. Just seeing this version of the film and thinking about theatrical cut makes me so mad because this version is so much more intriguing in every way.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a great comic book movie. It is probably my favorite film of the DCEU besides maybe Wonder Woman. It is such an interesting take on the crew that tackles themes like confronting trauma, relationship with parents and war. It has the perfect balance of dark and serious with optimism and hope. Also, it has such an amazing soundtrack. It has one of the best musical scores I have ever heard so if you do not want to watch the film, at least listen to the music. I still remember when I saw Man of Steel in theaters, so seeing how this is what Zack Snyder could have brought with Justice League is bittersweet, but at least there is a live-action version of Justice League that I can firmly say that I love now.", "Finally the DC superheroes as it should be!": "Thank you Zack Snyder, and the cast for this exellent movie!!!", "Let's not go overboard.. people giving this an 8?": "Sure, this \"new movie\" (more of a patch or DLC than a standalone) does certainly fix a LOT of the problems the original had. Like Henry's cgi moustache situation, tone consistency, a more believable friendship between some of the justice league members (specially Cyborg and Flash), more balance between the members during a fight/action scene (and putting Batman as far away from the actual action as possible, because there is no way this version of Batman would be useful here.. again), and a better ending by focusing the goal to the threat instead of a fight with Steppingwolf itself.While it is 4 hours, and doesn't really feel it, most of the scenes are expanded with little to nothing memorable. At least two scenes are better because of this meddling (a CGI Flash moment that is great was the highlight for me). But the core remains.\nYou can't fix the way Superman is in this universe, and the fact that he died and his immediately revived. There is no writing your way out of that..\nSome of the terrible jokes that I originally thought were Weldon's remain, there is even less Batman now (and he feels even more useless now), Barry is still the worst version of the Flash at times (which makes it even worse when he isn't a babbling idiot, but a normal human being in some scenes). And the colors are beyond depressing at times when compared to the original. For example the scene with Lois and a Clark on the farm, which is properly lit and bountiful with colors in the theatrical release.Personally, I think the movie should have ended as soon as the start of the unnecessary Epilogue. It was easily one of the worst things I've seen this year.. A certain character is given a second chance (redemption as an actor). And that's what they decided to make?\nNot only is the scene butchered by some strange cinematographic choices, the delivery and dialogue is beyond a disappointment. And did it even happen?It is the better version of the Justice League, but it still leaves a lot to be desired from a universe that will probably die with it. No reason to care anymore.", "how is it this good": "Impossible man... no way this movie can be this good. we deserved this back in 2017, i'm glad at least we got it now.", "Best remake": "Zack Snyder is a genius! He did a great job with the the reworked version of Justice League. This version was much, much better!!! Highly recommend watching this one and leave the other Justice League in the dust.", "The difference is like Night and Day": "For me, the first 2017 version was quite forgettable and corny. A pathetic carbon copy of the Avengers. This Snyder version however, is such a blessing. A miracle that redeems the whole Justice League saga. The longer duration is so worth it. These days we wouldn't think twice of binge watching 8 x hour-long episodes of a good action series in a day so 4 hours in one sitting is highly doable. If anything, necessary, to allow you to connect to the main characters. Great movie that sets us up for the possibility of more to come.", "Thank you god!": "Can't thank enough, restored my faith on miracles.\nDon't have much to say, I'm just glad.\nThank you Zack!\nThank you all the believers!\nThank you God !", "Myuch better than the MCU": "This one is not a theme park. The way it was supposed to be. We will from now on , just pretend that the 2017 movie never happened! Zack Snyder reveals what super heroes are supposed to be, they are not flawless....\nBen Affleck and Jared Leto redeem themselves here!", "This is the Justice League we know.": "Zack Snyder's final effort on the DC superhero team-up is HBO's \"Justice League.\" Following a personal tragedy, the director quit the production, and Joss Whedon took over. Snyder has given his characters a wildly distinct, harder-edged approach. On practically every level, \"Justice League\" offers a deeper and more satisfying experience. Some of the best original scenes remain, but how much is fresh and utterly different is startling. The majority of those complaints are about the last 30 minutes or so.", "This is how a super hero movie is made!": "#RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE.....should trend on twitter. DC.... don't do this huge mistake ever again... choose your directors and producers carefully.", "The best Movie": "Warner is known for making huge mistakes with his films, but this time I listen to people, honestly this film is one of the best and has no point of comparison with the one of 2017, zack snyder showed why he is the teacher.", "Clearly the superior Justice League": "My childhood favorite DC character was in this, he wasn't in the original, even if he only showed up for a few secondsI was obviously referring to Martian Manhunter, but that's not the only thing, this movie was far better, Steppenwolf wasn't stupid, Darkseid was present, and the movie stayed consistent, and contained a lot more plot. The original was weird and sad, this one was ripped right out of a comic. If DC chooses to leave the other movie canon instead of this then they are idiots.", "Finally.": "Great film. Only a 9 because it needed to be shorter. But fits in well, actually makes cyborg and flash important members of the league.For darksied.", "It was very good": "I had no idea that \"Justice League\" movie exist until 2021 and i have never watched it. Instead i watched Snyder Cut and i was shocked how good it is. When i finished i had a feeling that if any moment was cut out of the movie it would be much worse and i can not imagine how bad the original had to be (it was God damn 2h shorter). If only WB could let Zack Snyder do his job and don't interfere DCCU would be something at least at MCU level.", "Justice, At Last": "\"You know, I never thought I'd see the defenders of Earth united, fighting as one!\"Zack Snyder's Justice League, as it was always intended (well, maybe slightly longer), has finally been witnessed by the masses, who have wisely deemed it worthy and good.That Whedon version seems like a sloppily-assembled trailer for this one now, in comparison. This is fleshed out, filled with epic action moments and dramatic beats that were crucially missing before. It's got four hours to tell the story and it does so in terrific fashion, with a much more cohesive storytelling approach, one that cares. Specifically, I am stunned at just how much Cyborg stuff was obliterated by Whedon before. Now, Cyborg is a fully-explained character and not just 'Robot Guy\" standing behind Batman or whatever. Whedon and the studio just wanted it done and out there, regardless of what it became. Money makes men do bad things sometimes.My DC fanboy heart swelled so many times during this, but mostly during the Wonder Woman fight scene at the beginning and the epic final battle...and also that last minute set of scenes involving Deathstroke, Lex Luthor and The Joker. See, DC was expanding and world building all along, so maybe those people comparing DC to Marvel in a negative light can sit back and just enjoy all this like the rest of us.So glad the fans demanded this and got it, congrats to them and Zack Snyder.", "Better but still not great": "So there we're definitely improvements in this version and improvements that were needed. This version answered a lot of questions and gave us a lot more backstory. So I'm glad I watched it, however, the first 3 chapters were completely unnecessary and just seemed like a creative flex to get some fancy closeup shots in.Literally nothing in the first 3 chapters was necessary to understand the movie.Chapter 4 onwards was amazing and I would have loved to see that movie instead of this 4 hour epic!", "The movie you wanted to see": "The original version was the most okay movie ever. I enjoyed it and had no desire to see it again. Of course we all knew going into it the behind the scenes happenings so it was pretty hard to be objective. But no matter what it did not feel like the previous two Snyder movies. And as a huge fan of MOS and BVS I was very disappointed. Snyder is one of the few directors that has a unique vision. And his movies are especially important in contrast to the Marvel movies because without them we don't get superhero movies with substance that aren't afraid to have their own take on these classic characters.So now we have the true version, the version that we wanted to see a few years ago. And it's great. It fits in line with the previous two and pays off what was set up. Does justice to these great characters. And we get a really good introduction for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg. The last two really steal the show. It's secretly Cyborg's movie. Ray Fisher is great by the way. I hope we see more of him. And Ezra is really good, even if he's crazy.It may actually be better that it all went down this way. Because four hours would have never gone out into the theaters. And it sounds like Zack got a blank check on this. So I think that he got to make an even more Snyder cut than originally intended.I really enjoyed watching an epic movie that really took it's time. In many ways this felt like watching a Leone or a Lynch movie. Each scene existed unto itself without just feeling like a piece of the puzzle. Little moments of welcomed indulgence were allowed to happen. The movie was able to breathe.Through the story we see the characters strengths and how they work together very well. And just like what started in MOS this is a father/son story. Parents, but especially the dudes. Superman and his dads. Batman and his parents and Alfred. WW and her mom. Aquaman and his dad tying him to the surface. Flash trying to save his dad. Cyborg's dad story. And the little tid bit that I realized after watching it, Lois is pregnant with Superman's baby. I don't know if they'll make a sequel to this but after Superman Returns I really wanted to know what sups half human half Krypton baby would be like.I'm not actually faulting the movie for this but as comic fan there is only one character error: Batman would never let them know he's Bruce Wayne. But actually what we get to see here is a softer Batman than we've ever seen. Because last time he was at one extreme and he made a mistake and is trying to make up for it. I enjoyed seeing something new out of Bats.The little bit we got of Green Lantern was crazy cool and got me hyped. And as a Martian Manhunter fan I was happy and really wanted to see more.I do think it's funny that \"everybody\" hates these movies and then put up a big stink to see this. I hope they're happy with it and that from now on they're honest about what movies they like even if it puts their nerd credit in jeopardy. Because if it wasn't for the negativity towards BVS Snyder would probably still be making these. Because when he wanted to step back on this one WB didn't give him the time to return. They saw that his movies weren't liked and moved on without him. Because they thought that's what people wanted. God, I hope he goes back. He actually gets that in order to make these movies you have to make them your own.I am very glad that he got to fulfill his dream of making this movie. Because you know artistically it really had to burn. And it had to feel really good for him because everyone wanted it so bad. Good job Zack. Just like with Man of Steel he made me feel like a little kid again playing with my toys.", "HARRY HOUDINI WOULD BE PROUD": "What a Hell of a job. It is almost my belief that either WB and/or Joss Whedon wanted to tank Snyder's film for whatever reason. This movie is vastly different and even though it is very long for me I was entertained the entire time. Cyborg is an amazing character and somehow in this version we get to see that. The flash is an awesome character and in the first version he was just an annoying kid whereas here we are drawn to him. David Ayer deserves his Suicide Squad. And DC needs to back off when it comes to directors", "A Near Perfect Superhero Movie": "Let me get this out of the way first; I am not a fan of Zack Snyder at all as a director. He's the new generation of Michael Bay; sacrificing movie making pillars like story and script for style and flair. So how did he make one of the best superhero movies ever?What I found was around 20% of his cut was some of the most cringe inducing, awful cinema I've ever seen, with decisions that baffled me to my core (Zack, songs of people singing off key is objectively not good music).The other 80%, however, is some of the most mind-blowingly spectacular moments to ever be captured on the big screen. Snyder's music video visual style, incredible VFX+CGI plus intricately gorgeous shots captured in slow mo all lend themselves to a visually stunning final product. The action sequences in Snyder's cut gave me many goosebumps, and a very rare feeling of becoming overwhelmed with the majesty of what I was watching, which only happens with movies I consider the very best ever made.The real question is, does the 80% beat the 20? For this viewer, absolutely and then some. I may not be a Zack Snyder fan, but this is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.", "Zack Snyder's superior vision proves that he has a firm grasp on the DC universe": "\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is an improvement to the 2017 film in virtually every way. In comparison to the brisk and lighthearted tone that Joss Whedon and crew crafted, Zack's vision is methodically paced, giving each character, as well as the plot, the breathing room necessary to truly flourish.You're most likely wondering just how different this movie is; the simplest explanation I can give is that the story is similar to the 2017 film, but the journey is entirely different. Sure, on the surface this movie is still about a group of heroes coming together to stop an evil alien invader. And if that's all the plot you want to see, then I would recommend that you stick to the 2017 version. \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" has the framework of that original story here, but largely expands on character, story progression, and individual plot points, so much so that you'll find yourself shocked at exactly how much the studio decided to cut out for the 2017 release. Yes, Zack has truly delivered an entirely different film here, one that delivers all of the superhero action you want without sacrificing the heart that's needed for any successful comic book movie.Zack was not given an easy task when he was asked to direct this film - continuing the story introduced in \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v. Superman,\" telling a cohesive narrative, and introducing several never-before-seen characters, and to do all of that in a way that felt natural and thematically satisfying, and in an appropriate, studio-approved length - Zack Snyder was Atlas, taking the world on his shoulders. Obviously, WB executives deemed he wasn't up to the task, instead bringing in Joss Whedon to finish what Zack started. The Snyder Cut proves that those executives were misguided, as Zack wonderfully crafts a story that doesn't compromise on character, plot, or entertainment.Every character gets their time to shine here. Cyborg especially feels like the heart of the film, and I was shocked at how much the movie resolved around his character, and even more so shocked to see that practically all of his character development was removed for the Whedon cut. Cyborg's plot points involved real emotional resonance, with Zack depicting an empathetic character worth caring about. Similarly, Aquaman, The Flash, and Wonder Woman, all get ample time in the spotlight: Wonder Woman has a thrilling action sequence toward the beginning that is especially notable, and The Flash has a rescue scene that introduced him marvelously, with gorgeously filmed visuals and an undercurrent of romance that made my heart swell.The soundtrack is also miles better than the 2017 movie. Zack is a master of visual and audio storytelling, and his combination here of sight and sound is truly beautiful, evoking emotions even in the most jaded viewers. For example, an early scene featuring Lois Lane walking around the city, coupled with a song playing that has lyrics that perfectly encapsulates what Lois is going through after the death of Superman, was so perfect in its audio and visuals that I practically started tearing up because of the emotional resonance.Zack packs this film with the visually spectacular action you may expect - there are long sequences of special-effects packed combat scenes, and all of it looks good, filmed in wide shots and steady takes. Zack clearly cares about filming action that is fun to watch, and easy to comprehend, and he takes pride in epic, bombastic , crowd-pleasing action. And with an R-rating, the action hits harder than you may expect; parademons are sliced and diced, heads are lopped off, and blood smears and spatters. So, yeah, the action is fantastic here, but that's no surprise.What's more surprising is the fact that Zack managed to fill this movie with so much heart, and then WB executives decided to cut it all out. There is emotion here that is usually not found in superhero movies. Zack takes this material seriously, populating this universe with gods and monsters that are appropriately mythological and frightening, but he takes everything a step further by exploring humanity's reaction to having to live with these otherworldly forces. How does one cope when the love of their life, someone who they thought was invincible and indestructible, dies? How can you live a normal life when you have abilities that were unwanted and forced upon you? Is it possible to mend the wounds caused by fear of the unknown by fully embracing that unknown and recognizing it is good? All of these questions, and more, are explored in this film, leading to many sequences that actually brought tears to my eyes because of how beautiful they were. Additionally, there is a real maturity to the dialogue here, with a standout sequence toward the end featuring Batman and one of his enemies. The dialogue here is memorable and meaningful, once again proving that Zack has a firm grasp on the characters that inhabit this world.With a four-hour-long running time, you can rest assured that virtually everything you're seeing in the Snyder cut is, if not brand new, changed so much from the 2017 film that it might as well be. And you know that if you're sitting down to watch this movie - this is Zack's original vision, and what a vision it was. \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is a superhero movie that has to be seen to be believed - it's everything we wanted from the 2017 film, and so much more. This is a victory for fans, but most importantly, a victory for Zack. Well done, Zack - we all knew you could do it.", "What a different movie!": "Did Weaton even see the full story that that he massacred? This cut is not flawless, however it makes sense now, and is much better than what they tried to pass off in the original cut. With Snyder's apparent break from Warner after 15 years, it's clear that they just wanted to rush it through, take a hit if necessary, and move on. This is where it all fell apart. It's a shame too, because this had potential to continue the DCEU properly. This cut was better than WW1984. It's kind of an insult to injury that Snyder had to deal with personal tragedy, and watch his work be destroyed in the process. This was more serious, and character driven than the joke we got the first time. After seeing this, I understand exactly what Snyder was going for, what Whedon did instead, and it's frustrating, because this could have lead to more Justice League movies. Now, it most likely won't happen, because they are taking the characters in different directions. This is where Marvel is superior. Nowadays, you can enjoy solo Marvel content, while each one is another piece of a larger story. The DCEU is completely fractured, and disjointed now. With none of the solo movies being part of a larger narrative in the DCEU. All because the studio can't put one person in charge of managing the larger narrative, while individual directors work on the solo movies. Like Feige does with Marvel. The original cut is the perfect example of too much studio interference, creating a \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" scenario. I enjoyed this, but it was bittersweet, because this is the last time we'll see a decent Justice League movie, unless Warner Bros. seriously gets their act together, which I don't see happening. It least I have The Suicide Squad to look forward to. The Batman I'm still skeptical about.", "Wow. Epic!!!": "Well after the last JL I honestly did not\nHave big expectations.\nAfter I press the play button I was sucked into the movie and story. I love the darkness and the build of the characters. And it is a rollercoaster of emotions and high quality action scene.\nA well worth seeing and enjoy \ud83d\ude00To me maybe this is a new direction of way to make superhero movie? I must say I did not see this movie blow my mind as it did.", "Weoah! What a movie. myan!": "Stephenwolf is just an art of the shining side of the darkside.Oah! Snyder's vision was a serious legendary and artfull stroke for the movie that can make more than more realistic comic character in film.", "Why couldn't we get something close to this in 2017?": "The DC catalogue has intrigued me since it's beginning. I really admire that they really seemed to let directors have their takes on the characters (Before the 2017 JL) from the moment the film began I already began to feel a major difference in the film, the entire plot is different, and you can legitimately feel director Zack Snyder's style, the inappropriate jokes & cringeworthy dialogue are nowhere in sight, and for four hours I felt the DC universe that he was building for viewers in 2017 really got a serious expansion without suffering from feeling like an extended post credits scene. The runtime is necessary and feels like a new way to introduce new characters without having to deliver solo films first. Very enjoyable overall, really great to revisit, and worthy enough to be a film that fans across the seven seas united to demand.", "The wait is over... They approach the stage": "A cast of misfit characters come together to form a rag tag team to combat evil. Cue the music. Dim the lights. Batman takes a long drag from his Marlboro red before tossing it to the ground. Yeah he litters, he doesn't follow society's rules. Superman carefully adjust his red underwear on the outside of his suit. He is hoping to get lucky after the show. Wonder Women is \"wonder\"ing how her mother supposedly sculpted her from clay. She is suspicious. Something seems off there. Aquaman ponders why he couldn't have been Superman and if it's possible to preform a swapsies... or has that time passed. The Flash, dumb as ever, still exist. And finally. Cyborg. Who? Exactly.They enter the spotlight from backstage. The justice league. Silence. The crowd is empty. No one cared enough to watch a 4 hour play years after the fact. It seems so obvious now. Fooled once again.Who cares/10.", "Much better than original but is much much longer": "This has to be one of the longest films I've ever seen...... But was well worth it. Don't go in to it expecting an identical, but longer version as the original, because you'd be wrong like I was. It's pretty much a different film altogether with a few similarities here and there and a nice few bonuses which I won't spoil.", "Best DC Movie, PERIOD": "This movie is the best DC Film so far to be made. Zack Snyder's version of the Justice League will probably be the best thing to happen to DC and WB. The acting, action, VFX, writing, and hard work was amazing. I hope there will be a sequel. Only one problem, the pacing in some parts were very slow. But other than that, 9/10 - Very Recommended.", "Don't Ever Listen Critics (Yes Again!)": "I think disney giving money to critics spreading hate to DC movies even it's good. First Joker now Zack Snyder's cut. All I can say don't ever listen critics and watch it. I already watch it 3 times.", "\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\ude34": "Too long i think they could have made a better movie and without it being 4 hours long and also the movie is rated R when it could perfectly be pg13.", "Zack Snyder, The God of The Comic Book Movie": "In all of Zack Snyder's films, from the highs of 300 and Watchmen and the lows of Sucker Punch and Batman vs Superman, this film best shows what Zack is capable of when he's given full control of the ship. This film largely improves everything its 2017 version did. The characters are given more time to be fleshed out and developed. The villains are a genuine threat. Plus, thank God we don't have to see Henry Cavill's CGI face. While there were some parts of the film that could have been revised, it's still a solid film and Zack's best since Watchmen.", "Far Beyond Epic": "An amazing Improvement on the Other version of the film.Did not feel like four hours at all.Lots more characterization for Cyborg and Flash . Much more threatening villain with a realistic motivation ,seeking redemption in his Master's eyes.It removes the stupid parademon frequency subplot and the smelling fear rubbish from the other version .The film doesn't feel like the cobbled together Frankenstein from 2017.I enjoyed it immensely and cant wait for more", "A spectacle to be witnessed. A grand epic. Snyder's best work till date.": "How did the execs at WB prefer's Whedon's version is something that I will never be able understand.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a grand, indulgent and well crafted. This is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.It takes all the things fans deserved and mashes them into a Lord of the rings or Game of Thrones-esq content.Ok, so where to begin? The villains are a major, major improvement. Steppenwolf seems like a demon to be reckoned with. His design and his voice is scarier and his ambitions more clearer.The action was bombastic. I've never enjoyed superheroes killing demons so much. Their fights make so much impact. Snyder definitely doesn't let action down. It's bloody and gory and awesome.The Justice League is more cohesive and supportive unlike the theatrical cut. Most major improvements have to be Flash and Cyborg.And the music is epic. You'll never be able to get the theme out of your head. Junkie XL has really outdone himself.And although the movie is 4 hours long, it doesn't feel like it because the story makes sense and it's constantly interesting. This might be the most audience friendly film Zack Snyder has ever created and that says a lot.All in all, this is Snyder's best work and a must watch.", "Spectacular!": "Zack certainly knows how to portray comics on the silver screen. Hopefully #SnyderVerse is restored. Peace.", "One of the best DC Movie after Dark Knight!": "I am a DC fan and I get upset when important part is removed from the movie, just because it'll be too long. The best part about this movie is that Zack Snyder has considered taking multiple universe concept, which I believe only DC fans must have noticed. I have read Injustice 1 & 2 and I really loved the scene where Flash from future came in the past to inform Batman that \"Lois Lane is the key\".It was not explained in the short version but watching that end part literally gave me goosebumps!This is how DC movies should be made & I really appreciate the work done by the entire team.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League - The Justice Has Been Served Finally !": "I am going to make it clean & simple.. This one is just an ' OUTSTANDING ' movie \ud83d\udd25In my opinion, this one is easily one of the best superhero movies of all time for sure.It is a must watch for everyone who are superhero movie fans.The neutral section of audience will also enjoy this for sure ! \ud83d\udc4d", "Now THIS is Justice League!": "The definition of epic.It succeeds in almost every way the 2017 version failed.WB should finally learn from their repetitive mistakes and let the man do his thing! We need the rest of the trilogy!", "Zack Synder's Justice League": "Well, this is marginally better than the theatrical cut but it still has the same problems. This feels less like a movie and more like a miniseries. Zack Synder's Justice League is divided into seven chapters, if you include the epilogue. I did enjoy the character interactions between the team. Simple character moments like Alfred helping Diana with tea stood out to me. And I appreciated that Cyborg had more character development this time around. I also liked the meet cute Barry had with Iris West as he saved her life from the car crash. Song in the siren plays as Barry rescues Iris, that was an especially nice touch. I still think that Steppenwolf is a boring villain, despite him having a better motivation this time around. And I was never bored during the entire 233 minutes. However, I found the Injustice epilogue kind of superfluous, it only exists to sequel bait. Personally, I thought it should have ended in part 6 with Superman showing his emblem, that would have been perfect. If you enjoyed the theatrical cut of Justice League this is definitely worth watching for the extended character moments alone. Everybody else should stay away. This is a Zack Synder movie through and through. All his quirks are on full display, from the slow mo to the desaturated color palate. But I thought it was still an interesting experience all things considered.", "Please, let someone else make something out of this IP!": "Word limit, gotta hurry:Story: it's full of nonsensical plot points and incredible conveniences. For example: Superman's cry awake the Motherboxes. How is his scream waking them up? Is there a special tone for dying or is there a special gas that comes out of his mouth once he's dead? How come the motherboxes didn't open when Zod died and Superman screamed? Also the waves are travelling incredible distances which would imply that at the center of their emition it would have to be a sound nuke! Moving on... the amazonian women kill their own people in order to cage a guy who can teleport. This is beyond ebmarassing, like these amazonians see Steppenwold teleport inside so that would mean that walls can't hold him, still they destroy their stone cage in which they held their motherbox in order to bury Steppenwold who could teleport anyway. Who wrote this?! The amazonians sent a flaming arrow and then Diana finds the arrow and opens a hidden temple by placing the arrow in a stone door and seeing the story about Darkside. Even though that explains how she knows about Darkside and his invasion that still geerates more questions like: who build that temple? Why were the paintings made? Why did the amazonians sent Diana an arrow instead of coming to say that to her in person? How would the amazonians have the exact arrow that would fit the temple door and thus open it? Wonder Woman decides to block the terrorists' bullets instead of rushing them and restraining them, although when she faces Clark later when he revives, she wants to restrain him rather than fight as tough as she could. In Barry's introduction scene the driver that crashes Iris' car eats a burger and he dodges under his steering wheel for his burger and thus generates the crash. Like who in their right mind would do such a thing while driving? Who wrote such a scene and someone who would behave so unrealistically? Cyborg has the biggest and most unlimited power in the world (although that contradicts the script which wants you to believe that if Darkseid would have such a power, that would be bad), and that he can hack anything and comand anything that is somehow connected to internet. So the first thing he makes is give a woman hundred tousands of dollars which will most surely be investigated by the IRS and would most probably destroy her life more than it already was. Darkside is defeated by earthlings with bows, arrows, spears and swords, when he has technology that is more advanced even than the technology earth has thousands years later. Like how? And above all Ares who was destroyed by Wonder Woman is the one who delivers the blow that defeats Darkside and makes him retreat in scare. What a way to introduce a villain and just have him look like an absolute weakling. Moreover, Darkside and all his staff forget that Earth was the planet that defeated him and had the Anti-Life Equation. Darkside kind of forgot... Moving on... Lois just so happens to pass by the site where Superman's tomb was in Metropolis and thus stoping Clark when he is on the verge of killing Batman. Convenience at its very best folks! Joss' cut had Batman bringing Lois as a contingency plan had Clark turned against them. Oh... The Flash has the ability to turn back time without any consequence which basically means that there are no stakes in this universe because whenever it goes bad he can turn back time and fix everything. This story is broken! This movie is broken! The parademon who remains alive after Batman's rampage is the one that stops Flash when he was spinning, which is as likely as me becoming a succesfull director tomorrow. Next..The Characters: There are three types of character development in this movie for any character: either the character is assassinated considering the previous movies with him or his own solo movies, or he stays the same he always was with no development in between the three or more movies he or she were in, or gets somewhat of a story and character arc but which comes along with countless other problems. For example Cyborg is portrayed as a guy so traumatized by his accident and the fact that his father used the motherbox to make him a cyborg and thus making him ugly in the eyes of everyone, that he shields himself from the outside world. That might sound as a good premise for a character arc, and Cyborg does get somewhat of a character arc but at the same time he gets so many other problems like: he has complete control over everyone's lives making him a dr. Manhattan. The worst part is that aside from helping that woman (and simultaneously destoying her life) he doesn't do anything with that power throughout the rest of the movie, he doesn't even save his father who kills himself in order to give the motherbox a heat signature. The Flash is portrayed as a lonely guy lacking friends who has his father in prison and looks for a job. All of these things are in the Joss cut. The only thing added in this movie is Iris' accident which is a mess to say the least (see above the argument why) and his ability to turn back time destroys any stake this movie and the next ones in the serie might have. His payoff is basically him pushing the button of time reverse and eveyone is so impressed by his character arc. Batman is basically the same guy as in BvS with only the regret of getting Clark killed and thus wanting to gather up a team, which from what I know is in contradiction with the essence of his character. In most of the Justice League stories he is either very lonely and not trusting in the other league members, or he develops a plan to destroy all the main members in case they get compromised. How is the plot of this movie that has him gathering up the team not against his character? Superman is basically the same as in the other movies and is absent for most of the movie. And even when he comes back he just speaks with Lois and his mum and then suddently realizes that he has something to do even though he doesn't know what. In Joss' version he receives the news that Bruce needs his help from Lois who was brought by Batman when they revived Clark. Wonder Woman's character is basically assasinated comparing it to her previous solo movies in which she never ever killed when she had the oportunity to not do it. Here she killes the terrorists in the beginning although she could have restrain them and hand them over to the police, she kills Steppenwolf along side Aquaman at the end even though that guy was defeated and there was a portal opened to Darkside's homeworld where they could have thrown him anyway. Whatever... moving on... Darkside wants to have the Anti-Life Equation in order for the whole life in the multiverse to belong to him... because.... he's evil. Aquaman has no improvement aside from \"take up your mother's trident\" scene. Even his badass scene in which he goes for a swim in the huge waves was destroyed in this version by having the song that played on the background changed to a weird and boring song that didn't suit the scene in no way shape or form. Speaking of it...The soundtrack: This can be summed up as a mixed bag. There are such weird choices like having a heavy metal style song playing during the scene in which the League climb stairs. Then there are the weird songs choices like the one I mentioned for Aquaman or the song in the Flash introduction scene. Other than that there are the old themes of Superman, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor. The new themes of Cyborg and Flash are nice and the League theme is the true highlight of the soundtrack of this movie. However the Aquaman and Atlantis theme are bland and the new Batman theme is just simple and generic. Also... what was the weird voice everytime Wonder Woman's theme played? I cannot imagine that someone who oversaw the editing of the soundtrack of this movie didn't notice how awful that sounded and how much that was used and how annoying that was! One last thing... the chorus that sings when Bruce leaves Aquaman's village is... I mean, I haven't ever heard a more bizare singing that that ever in my life. Was that supposed to be Ben Affleck passing by and some natives singing something randomly and hoping that it turns out good and interesting?The acting: for the most part is ok but it suffers from the same syndrome that all the Snyder movies suffer, and that is the overexaggerated sadness of all characters. The only one that is more light hearted and makes jokes and brings somewhat of fun in this movie is the Flash. The actual highlight of this movie is Cyborg and his dad who act at times incredibly powerfull. They are the only ones that play their characters well and stand out in this sad little universe up until this point.The dialogue: so much of the dialogue is basically just exposition like for example De Saad saying Steppenwolf's entire backstory in his face when there is no one there that doesn't already knows it. The Flash telling his dad's entire story and reason for being in prison to him, because whoever wrote this can't write expository dialogue. Every character lays out every single information about themselves or others in front of the audience without any subtlety. Oh wait... we understand who these charactes are only through their dialogue and not through their actions or their history.In conclusion, aside from minor improvements done to Cyborg's character and some minor continuity fixes this movie is a total disaster, filled with terrible dialogue, cringy moments, sad acting and weird soundtrack. So what can we make of this? Well, it's just a more bloated Josstice League, worse than Joss' cut. The characters have been assassinated no matter if you consider their previous movies or the comic books, the soundtrack is disjointed if not bad, the CGI is obvious at times and the dialogue is awful. Don't understand why so many people like it... probably they just told themselves they will like it since they brought it into existence. 3/10 Terrible!", "Length is not the problem": "Yes it is 4 hours long. That is not the problem. If something is good, 4 hours is an easy binge. This superhero movie is just bad making the 4 hours a chore. It is hard to tell if the stiff acting is caused by poor direction or the poor writing or that many in the cast are just poor actors. Even a fine actress like Amy Adams feels like she is just going through the motions.All the Justice League turns out to be is a vessel for action sequences with cliche dialog and superhero poses to fill in the gaps.", "Far better version.": "Thoroughly enjoyed this version!But is it just me or is Ben Affleck not real (CGI) in de last extra scene? Can't find any mention anywhere of this though...", "Zack Snyder's Revenge of the Sith?": "I was never really into the Snyderverse before this came out. I remember disliking Man of Steel when first watching it and turning off Batman v Superman after the first 20 minutes. The Josstice League cut was a complete abomination.And then along comes this. It's actually not that bad, even though it retains many of the irritating issues superhero movies in general have. (Powers popping up out of nowhere, overpowered main characters, etc). It's a little odd that this may be Snyder's least excessive film when it's the 4-hour long one. But much like with George Lucas' unjustly maligned prequels, Snyder manages to redeem his series simply by showing us the (kind of) culmination of what he was building up to all this time. If he made a sequel to this Justice League it would definitely be worth watching.Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is how seriously the characters take everything...the days when 'Iron Man' could be praised for being a light-hearted take on a self-serious genre are well behind us, drowned out in the modern atmosphere of Whedon-esque snark. Sure, maybe it's easier to make fun of when you're watching it, but that's all part of the entertainment. Movies that try to immunize themselves to ridicule usually end up sapping out all enjoyment. I'd take clunky dialogue and over-ambition any day.Side note: I may have to pay the Snyderverse movies a re-visit since they are well on their way to becoming cult classics in ways the Marvel movies really aren't. (Let's face it, does Captain America Civil War have anything as iconic as the 'Martha' scene? No, it doesn't. Even Marvel fans have forgotten pretty much everything about it--they are generally loyal to the brand and not to the films themselves).", "Zack Snyder's Justice League Awesome": "Zack Snyder's directional is best. Its far better than 2017 Justice League. Its my humble request to the producers and makers of the film to keep this series under Zack Snyder directional.", "A little bit too long, but much better than the 2017 film": "This movie plauds along at quite a slow pace which is sort of understandable because there is some backstory to be told. By 3 hours in I had figured that this movie was just kind of a waste of time and then everything kicked into high gear and what was left was some of the best most action packed super hero action every made. It literally blew the roof off of the old movies end fight sequence.\nIf you have 4 hours to spend and at least a little bit of patience it does pay off in the long run. Enjoy!", "Masterpiece!": "This is the real justice league movie. 2017 movie can't even stand with this movie. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "This was Excellent": "This movie actually made sense. The villains had depth. Each character had their moment. The last 30+ minutes were incredible. It was long, but I would totally watch it again.1 point deducted for excessive use of slow motion.", "One of the best movie": "This movie is really great and amazing. While watching this movie I just feel like wow, Zack Snyder done amazing things in this movie. This is what real Justice league movie look like.", "Spectacular Movie, DC PH": "This movie proved that Joss Whedon messed-up the 2017JL. The good news is Zack Snyder had given a chance to do his original version and this is the best superheroes movie that you don't want to miss. I believe when it comes to slow motion and fighting scenes, ZackSnyder is the real deal. Nothing can top Snyder fighting scenes. His visual is very unique and you can see here in ZSJL how he introduce every DC character and established each one of them. Joss whedon wanted to give us an idea that Marvel is better than DC. Not in the world of Snyderverse, ZSJL are way better than all Marvel movies out there. Overall perfect movie from all ages and I will give you assurance that the final fight scenes here will blow your mind. It's 2022 and the old regime of WB are gone now and now it's time to #RestoretheSnyderVerse.", "Justice has been served!": "I think it's only fair to watch the film how Zack intended and I must say I really enjoyed it! I connected with the characters, I bought into the storyline, there's real emotion, there's real action, there's real suspense. Yes, it could have been slightly tidier with the character narrative transitions but all in all it delivered. Need to see JL2!", "Excellent, the movie I expected in 2017": "We finally got what we asked for. This is content and creativity I gladly pay for.", "Really Jack Snyder's Justice League is Amazing?": "2017 Justice League was not that satisfying, But this This Snyder Cut Is Epic.Thank you Jack Snyder for Your wonderful Work, Keep creating, Keep Motivating.", "Surprisingly decent": "Up until a couple days ago, the last DC movie I'd watched in this continuity was Man of Steel when it was new in 2013. I also don't read comic books and do my best to avoid spoilers for everything, so the entire plot was new to me.I marathoned the 3-hour cut of Batman vs Superman yesterday, and then this 4-hour movie today. They were both entertaining movies. I don't really have any complaints aside from a few plot/character quibbles, and a few scenes where I had no idea what was going on since I've never watched the Flash or Cyborg TV shows - the details did eventually get filled in, though.I'm not going to say the movie felt like it flew by - four hours is a long time - but it also felt like it was the correct amount of time to give to this story.Six stars is a good review - I try to base everything around five stars as 'fine',(instead of the way a lot of people essentially think of anything below five as 'unwatchable garbage'.) That all being said, it also doesn't feel like something I'll ever undertake again.", "The movie suddenly made sense": "I was sceptical about a 4 hour long movie, but boy was I wrong. Its a great movie, and compared to the not Snyder cut, this movie got everything to make sense. I'm really looking forward for the 2 and 3 movie.And this is from a Marvel fan, DC/Snyder really made this a great movie.", "Much much better, but still flawed.": "I'm happy Snyder got the chance to release his vision on this movie, because it needed it. A lot more back story, more character development, a lot darker, a lot more serious. He did justice to Cyborg and Flash had a more serious part, not the comical release. Would've loved that he utilized Aquaman and Wonder Woman more, but at least they didn't come off as completely useless. Even though Batman has no super powers, Snyder definitely made him more of an integral part of the story as the one that brought them together and being the motivator in the team. CGI looked a lot better, especially Cyborg didn't look completely fake... everything looked better. A bit too long, some of the story felt like filler material and some scenes were stretched too much... could've probably told the same story in 3 hours without missing out on any part of the story... on the other hand I rather have it this way then cutting too much and being presented with the original cut.", "Wow just Wow!": "I never had to expect to watch the real Justice League here, I thought it would have the same crap as the Whedon's cut in 2017 Justice League. 4hrs on the edge of the sit is crazy!Wonder Woman's action scene was awesome, and that was supposed to be the kind of Wonder Woman action we expect in WW2 1984 but it never happened.I hope Warner Bros. Would make a sequel on Justice League.", "My god this is phenomenal": "And it's well worth the 3hr 42 running time. There's loads of differerences from the original, and even though I liked the original, this is miles better, it's a true masterpiece.\nSo what happens now? Affleck is out as Batman... Why? He's a brilliant Batman, and now I hear Cavill is definitely out as Superman, again why? He's easily the best Superman since Christopher Reeve.\nPlease can we have some more of this with Cavill still as Superman.", "It passed the wife test.": "Half way through the movie my wife asked if this movie is the one they made to fix Supermans face. Made my day.As for the review, this movie is what the fans deserved, to see the finished product was amazing. More importantly it's what the cast and crew deserved after all the BS that WB put them through. And for Zack to get his Justice, just brilliant.All the great parts of the 2017 movie that \"critics\" claimed must have been filmed by Joss, well this proved them wrong. Zack clearly made a great film back then and as proven by history the suits at WB do nothing but ruin great films.I give the movie a 10/10 for the fact it actually exists and is awesome.", "Long as hell, but hey way better than the original": "Zack Snyder created the vision he had for this movie. It has been redeemed of the former same named debacle we got in 2011. It still flat and empty compared to any marvel flick. But the characters do seem to have more depth this time and some humor brings the movie and interesting touch. Darkside is the vilan we all deserved and we finally getting him. Unfortunately its to little to late the DC universe has already been destroyed by inadequate directors and producers. The last wonder woman movie ww84 was the finally nail on the DC universe coffin at least we got a worthy goodbye with this directors cut.", "Best DC movie to date": "I am among those who kind of thought the theatrical cut was decent. Average and forgettable but not terrible.This one however.. the tone is just right. It's engaging and well acted. Things are explained the way I want them to be. It's on the same level as Infinity War and that's to me as good as it gets in the genre. By far the best DC movie I have ever seen.Of course it's about the directing but also because of its length. Miniseries are often great because they are given the time to tell the story. This is the same. If it takes 4 hours to make a great movie, let it take 4 hours!Hopefully WB will learn from the praise of this release and make the right decisions from here on.", "Justice - It's a completely different movie": "Zack Synder's Justice League can be summed up fairly easily as being almost completely different to the 2017 cut of the same movie. Having been heavily cut, majorly reshot and presented with a different emphasis following Zack Synder leaving during it's production the original movie lacked direction, heart, motive for most characters (good characters or bad) and resulted in a movie that failed to provide interest for viewer. This new 2021 version solves and satisfies all the issues.ZSJC follows on from 'Batman vs Superman' in the aftermath of a world without Superman. It's this lack protection for earth that make all conquering beings from across the galaxy aware that the planet now ripe for the taking. The main antagonist is Steppenwolf who is challenged by his leader to take over earth, in order to do this he must search out and reclaim ancient alien technology left on earth many centuries ago when humans and earth gods defended the planet from a an invasion. The movie essentially is about Bruce Wayne bringing together a group of heroes to take on this invasion.The core story remains fairly similar to the 2017 efforts but it is told in a much more cohesive way by introducing all of the characters in depth, bringing us up to speed on who, why and what they are. You have to remember that at the time of original release we had only be introduced to Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman in previous movies. Without any back story, the new characters literally had no motivation to be there. In this version Cyborg steals the show, not only in the actor's performance but the character as the heart of the whole movie, in 2017s version he seemed like an afterthought or just to tick boxes.This movie is 4 hours long. However it is highly engrossing, particularly if you have any vested interested in the previous films, the DC franchise or just Batman. I suspect that non fans of the genre will not find this half as entertaining. That being said the movie screams epic, in its size, its ability to carefully handle so many characters and to tell a story where the characters are in serious jeopardy. It might not quite hit the heights of Marvel's Infinity War, but for me, it's quite close and definitely sits proud as one of the best superhero/comic book movies.The saddest part is how open ended the movie is and the multiple teasers for further stories throughout the movie, that originally had intention to be separate movies, which are no longer in production at the time of writing this review. I hope that I can look back at this review in years to come having seen them come to fruition off the back of the clear success Zack Synder's Justice League really was..", "Zack Snyder's JL (in 31 points)": "*SPOILER ALERT*1.

It was way to much ultra-slow camera, bad CGI and \"epic moment\" music. It kept on repeating the same formula over and over again, until you get fed up. Or at least I got fed up. It's a no for me.\n(no, I'm not a Marvel fanboy but I have to admit Marvel is doing a better job with their scripts)", "True Justice": "Four hours of pure art. Comparable to a retelling of modern mythological gods. Not an overly complex plot, but many emotionally resonating characters, moments of cheer (and tears) with some amazing action sequences. Junkie XL composes a score for the ages. This isn't a film, it's an event.", "Brilliant!": "This anhilates the previous cut. Just awesome. Hopefully we get to see Zack do all the films now.", "FINALLY A PROPER JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE": "This is by far one of the best dc era movies. The acting was mostly great. The extra details were amazing. I finally felt a real character in the justice league characters now i can care about cyborg. Darker more story and simply better.", "Just WOW!!!": "Best movie I've seen in awhile. Story told right! No complaints whatsoever. When is Justice 2 coming out? Awesome movie!!", "Far better than the original cut!!": "A much better version of the film, made more sense, makes you think with all the scenes in this film already shot how the other came out????Not one for giving away spoilers, so watch the film!Only disappointed part is the Aspect ratio of the film, in the world of widescreen why oh why 4:3???If watching with the kids, please note there are 3 very clear F-bombs & 1 that can be easily missed. The gore level is 15 certificate level.", "Wayyyyyy Better!!!!": "I wasnt expecting it to be that much dif honestly.. its a totally new movie that is 1000 times better than the other cut! Nice work!!!", "Excellent, a bit slow-paced though, DC EU future restored!": "If you've seen the first edition of JL film then this version will be a bit slow paced. However Snyder has completely restored my faith in the DC cinematic universe going forward. With a bunch of added character depth and new heroes/villains it feels like a less empty in this universe. This film felt more in tuned with what Marvel has been doing for years but with a darker tone.\nAnd I must say I saw some similarities with Avengers Infinity War & Endgame but that doesn't matter. Cant wait for the future of DC universe, I just hope they follow more of this path in other installments.", "The best of the best": "Lo mejor que he visto en DC, una pel\u00edcula que no se compara con la primera.Mis mejores 4 horas invertidas de mi vida", "overlong static boring end of cinema": "Its so big, it cant walk, its missing any thrill or humor, watching 6 superheroes standing around a table and discuss, how they can save the world, then they move in one slow motion scene after the other, the cgi scene look extremely artificial, actors just reading oneliners, story if worse than a mediocre tv series, giving a very undemocratic message, that only a few super rich and superhumans can save the world.They squeezed every human touch, drama and thrill out of cinema.This type of movies has grown into dinosaurs and will hopefully disappear as those.", "Actually Very Good": "Not sure why people are bashing this movie. I think it came off as very well written, the mood was well executed, characters were developed properly, and Steppenwolf was more explained. In the 2 hr version, it felt like everything was rushed. Cyborg was not as deep of a character. Steppenwolf's assault on the Amazons was leas brutal and developed. We didn't really understand why Steppenwolf was on the warpath for earth, other than acquiring the mother boxes. Now, we know he is on a bit of a redemption path himself. Speaking of redemption, I loved that this movie actually featured Darkseid. I also like the darker version of Steppenwolf, as far as his image. The special effects I saw were spectacular. Superman in a black suit was also a nice surprise, fitting, since he is back from the dead. Even The Flash is given more of a background, and his humor plays well against the other characters and dark backdrop of the movie. In the final, Knighmare scene of the move, I personally felt that Joker's appearance was very fitting, more somber and menacing on a deeper, psychological level vs his portrayal in Suicide Squad; his appearance in a straightjacket as well as his taunting of Ben Affleck's Batman was very unsettling indeed. Ppl may bash this Joker bc it is Jared Leto's but I personally felt it was a great scene. In all, I throughly enjoyed this version of Justice League. I feel like the people that didn't like it perhaps are used to the shorter-spanned movies with a bunch of action scenes, but I enjoyed the longer, more developed version.", "Superhero Film that Takes Itself Seriously. A Proper Epic!": "Even as a self-admitted comic book nerd and fan of comic book hero films, I recognize that while we have been treated to a new level of excellence in the genre over the past decade, the majority of what is released, especially by DC comics, is simply another comic book movie. While this film is largely the same story as the original theatrical release only at twice the duration make no mistake; this is not just another superhero film. The additional footage is seamlessly added to the original journey of Bruce Wayne to recruit more heroes to face an imminent threat from an ancient, interstellar threat. True humanity, global stakes and high drama contribute to the scope of what can only be described as a proper epic.", "Long, But in a Fantastically Epic Way.": "Four hours will seem daunting to many people, and I myself had to watch it in parts. But it is worth it, in every way, to set aside the time to see this film.Snyder put so much effort and care into these characters; you can tell that Whedon never really did. The focus of the movie isn't just on Batman and Wonder Woman - as in the inferior 2017 Version - but on everyone who makes up this team. That is definitely the right move.The lives and stories of each member of the team, the different worlds they come from, we get to see and feel it all. This is where the four hour runtime suddenly feels like a blessing. Rarely have we gotten to know superheroes so intimately.Cyborg, who was entirely sidelined as a supporting character with minor importance in the Whedon cut, is established as the heart of this movie. All he ever wanted was for his busy father to be there, and it's not until Victor loses his mother and his own life that his dad finally shows up. When later he loses his father too, it pushes him over the edge and gives him the drive to be a hero, to be a part of the world rather than to shy away from it.The Flash is more than just a joke machine, having key, emotional moments with both his father and a love interest. His relationship with his father motivates him, both in his normal life and his superhero outings. Billy Crudup gives a believable performance as a 150% supportive dad in the short screen time he had.Aquaman also receives the same treatment; his \"Surfer Dude\" persona is muted to make way for an intriguing inner conflict. His hatred for his mixed ancestry is palpable; his struggle in being an outcast in both of the worlds he come from is communicated perfectly by Momoa. When he does finally come to terms with his heritage, we don't question it.I feel the story and plot will not be what most people see this movie for, however. Certainly, it won't be what they remember. The most memorable aspect will be the cinematography, the epic feel to a large majority of the scenes and the artistic quality of the images that Snyder puts in front of them.The camera work is sublime; every fight scene is punchy, purposeful, and the action is directed and shot well. When they get to work, these heroes feel like how they're supposed to: larger than life. Whether it's Wonder Woman banging her cuffs together, the Flash running faster than light, Cyborg taking down buildings with his arm cannons, or Superman handling the villain who had given all the other heroes so much trouble without breaking a sweat - literally - these heroes do a fine job of bringing a sense of epicness and scale to this film, much more so than what I've felt from other superhero flicks.This is what Superhero Films can - and should - be.", "Wow man ! finally I know dc ........": "This great things was going to happen in 2017 just imagine, it's way more Powerful than other dc movie instead of cristopher's batman .........", "DC > Marvel": "Surely a comparison many won't agree with.This massive movie gave me just so much more pure & better entertainment then any Marvel movie before though.Already during the movie I was looking forward to rewatching the movie.It is of course missing the humorous and colourful setting of Marvel, which is just obviously shaped for a wider scope of viewers.These 4-hours were worth every second for me. The darker and more violent setting of DC movies just feels way more authentic to me then the family-style of Marvel.It is a small cinematic tradegy we will never see the initally planned full trilogy of Justice League. The explosive setting with many open cliffhangers at the end of Justice League 1, including many known and new faces, just feels like a punch into the stomache now.", "Amazing": "Looking for the next one, probably it won't happen but I hope it does", "Stop being foofy... its the same iffy film but 2 hours longer": "This review isnt about Snyder, I dont have any opinion on him honestly. To me, the story didnt change on any fundamental level nor did I care for the character development in the least. I struggled to sit through it and in the end, I couldnt keep focused and ended up watching basketball while it ran in the background. Why? Because i already saw this film. It wasnt great the 1st time, so why would I want to see it again in slow motion?This was a waste of time and effort and I have no idea what the other reviewers watched nor do I believe that the reviews are real. I think a normal human being would not have ranked this higher or lower than the original on average. It should be a wash. Yet its rated 2 points higher? I dont think so. I think its paid reviews. IMDB is drowning in them right now. Please find a way to cut some of these fakes. Its not that hard but you have to try.", "The best DCEU movie ever": "No spoilers\nThe best DCEU movie and one of the best movies I've ever watched. Just gonna say one thing,that previous version of Justice League was a joke compared to this one. #ThankYouZackSnyder for making #ReleasetheSnyderCut possible. The only bad thing about this is, the movie ended. After the ending... I just can't wait for the 2nd part if they decide to make any and they should", "Zack is back baby!": "First things first. 4 hour cut was the right decision and totally justified. All these characters were begging to be fleshed out in 2017 Josstice League and they do it beautifully this time. Also the 4:3 aspect ratio does not bother at all. This indeed is a whole new movie as it was advertised and the hype is real.This movie really works for 3 reasons:1. Zack had the right vision of how a Justice League movie is supposed to be. He knows except Batman and Wonderwoman, none of them had an origin movie. Characters like Cyborg and Aquaman (at that time) don't have a fan following. They needed to stand toe to toe with the other boulders.\n2. Steppenwolf, is a better villain in terms of his look as well as motivation. Really shameful how Whedon had turned him into basic generic evil guy.\n3. Much more depth, heart and emotions that are allowed to linger on screen for the right amount of time. Unlike Whedon version which was basically pow pow humor pow bang bang humor.This is truly a special one from Snyder and they need to start putting together JL2 script and start filming ASAP.Also yes #RestoreTheSnyderUniverse", "Snyder's best work yet. The true Justice League.": "Not only the movie we should have received in 2017, but one of the best Comic Book Movies I've ever seen.Visually it's Snyder at his peak, hundreds of moments that could be framed, the action is perfectly captured and the actors have never looked better, thanks to Fabian Wagner's cinematography.Narratively, every character gets to shine. But Cyborg gets to shine the most; truly the heart of the film. Here, the heroes really get some time to connect and become a team.Finally, Junkie XL's score makes the images on screen feel even more energetic, but also finds the balance for more delicate and emotional scenes.With this, we can erase from our mind the horrors of \"Josstice League\"\nMany critics, bloggers and some \"fans\" love to hate Snyder; they live creating imaginary controversy and throwing hate towards him, amounts of hate few other creatives have seen in their careers. Yet, Snyder stands. And his fans, and rational-neutral DC fans can enjoy one of the coolest DC films ever!", "It's a whole different experience!": "This is the Justice League DC NEEDS, not the one it DESERVES!Looking back to 2017 Josstice League, there's no way on earth that this Zack Snyder's Justice League did not out 2017's version of this film, from it's storyline, dialogue, visuals, and the screen time given to Cyborg (Heart of the Movie), as well more screentime to Flash and wait for it, Batman!!!!!! It was great movie really!I've watched it 3 times and I could watch it again anytime!", "This has to be a joke": "I'm still in awe that people have not only rated this movie so high but are calling it an all time great superhero movie. There was poor character development, a horrible ending, and an absurd amount of plot holes. DC has again made a subpar movie and now everyone is excited to have Zack Snyder lead the dceu when he is the reason why it has been so poor in the past. I honestly can't see why any true DC fan could watch this and be satisfied.", "This is the infinity war of the DCEU": "I really had no hopes about this movie, but when the credits came, i can't believe that were so close to never watch this cut. I don't call this movie masterpiece, instead of that, i called this redemption of Snyder as a director.", "An Event in Cinematic History": "Warner Bros. butchered this movie concept by removing the essential meat of the story, characters and more in the theatrical release back in 2017. This cut of the movie is by far more comprehensive, intense and detailed than the 2017 version. It leaves you wanting to see more. The DCEU is better off being its own mature energy rather than being a juvenile product of a studio that produces souless, tired carbon copy content.", "Boring": "The movie is long and boring. It drags too long. IF it's 2 hours, that would make it better. I pretty much fast forward the whole thing. The storyline itself is fine but it just too little topic and want to make it a long story but not successful apparently. Maybe also because i saw the rating and thought it was good but got disappointed.", "We're back!!!!": "Finally we get to see the true justice league after such a painfully long wait and oh boy was it worth it! It was everything i hoped and dreamed it would be. Im so happy he was given the chance to finish what he started and us fans finally got to see the snyder verse restored.", "Well Done": "Enjoyed the darkness and energy level; the extremely detailed back/story presented in the directors cut +reshoots and castings and SFX as opposed to the somewhat disjointed, boorish, cynical juvenileness of the original Justice League. Zack Snyder's Justice League, in my opinion, represents a far more serious approach at storytelling (I also thoroughly enjoyed Man of Steel). My only gripe, I really didn't appreciate Snyder's use of the 1.33 : 1 format. Whilst understanding the desire of Snyder's wishful IMAX presentation, such framing can still be accomplished shooting widescreen. 2016 industry statistics indicated less than 2% of all theater screens globally were PLF (large format screens, ie: IMAX). Given COVID we're living in a new reality and with that it isn't likely many will be returning to theaters anytime soon - coupled with bedbug infestations, price gouging, unscrupulous distribution agreements and the like, the theater experience has become a buzz kill for quite some time... I'd honestly rather experience HD/4K films at home in DD and DTS where it's defiantly safer, cleaner and unquestionably cheaper.", "Yes": "It could have been longer. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute and compared to the 2017 version it's not even close. This is a must watch 9/10.", "Listen to the fans, not the critics, on this one": "Critics still don't know how to review this genre. This version of the movie did not disappoint.", "At Last, An Actual Coherent Film With A Director Who Cares!": "This one actually should've been 5 or 6 hours, and oh look, characters actually have purposes! Flash and Cyborg actually were important to the plot!And most of all, Cyborg's arc, a tragic character was really well done in this movie, and even though Flash was still a little cringey and his opening origin was unnecessary, he was better in this one and did more things and important things.Action was awesome and it was obvious there was thought behind it, thought of someone who gives a sht about these characters.Funnily enough the 1 minute Wonder Woman fight she had at the beginning of the movie was better than the entire WW84!Nearly everything in this version (this is the original version!) was better than that horsesht Josstice League movie that was sht out in 2017.Watch it and enjoy it and be grateful of Zack for finishing his vision for the fans, the movie that these characters at least deserved, regardless of what you think about Zack Snyder and DCEU, this movie should have happened.", "Justice Prevailed": "This movie justifies all the superheroes and their role, doesn't fully focuses on Superman. Bit lengthy and seems slightly boring may be because core story was same but it explains most of the story and seeing DarkSied was satisfactory.\nHope next version on the ending.", "A Massive Achievement, bringing life back to DC": "A few years ago when the theatrical cut of Justice League came out, the DC Universe was immediately put in doubt, as the movie underwhelmed both fans, critics, as well as the box office. A forgettable, throwaway generic movie; a version that will no longer be remembered now that we finally have the long awaited Snyder Cut of Justice League.\nWe probably never would've gotten this cut of JL in theaters, but this cut feels much more compact and cohesive. You learn so much more about characters such as Cyborg, Flash, and even Steppenwolf. Even as Darkseids(!) lacky in this cut, he feels more like a fully fleshed character, as opposed to a generic villain who just wanted the boxes.\nRay Fisher as Cyborg benefits so greatly from this version that he almost feels like the main character of this movie. You feel for the character you never would've thought you would a couple years ago. Ezra Miller as Barry Allen (Flash) no longer feels like the lame comic relief, he serves a major purpose to this team and as a whole you see the character realize his potential in this version. The rest of the cast is still great, I'll always be a fan of Henry Cavills Superman.\nThe last 20 minutes of this movie really made me want to see more of this universe. This is a major achievement and a huge congratulations should be given to Zack Snyder for seeing his vision through, after everything he has been through. I'm a big fan of his work, and this is right there with Watchmen as my favorite movie of his. The work he went through for us fans to see his vision cannot be overseen. This is exactly what DC fans have been hoping to see.", "Epic Nerdgasm!": "I find it hilarious that most of the bad reviews are from people who can barely string a sentence together! Yes it's long, yes it's a comic book movie, you should have known this going in, so why TF are you complaining? Anyhoo, this film is for the fans and I am one! I loved it!", "Snyder at his best": "If you like Snyder's style, and if you like DC characters, this will be one of the greatest cinematic experiences you can experience. I'm in my 40's, I enjoy many different movies, including much of the MCU. I have always been a big fan of Snyder's work, and for me this movie is the best of the best in the comic book movie Universe.\nZack handled the multiple story lines flawlessly, but his best talents lie in visuals and action sequences. Having the opportunity to compare to another director proves this tenfold. Zack Snyder just cemented his status as one of the all time greats and I'm extremely excited to see what he does next (which is hopefully JL2 and JL3).", "Thank God!": "I'm finally glad he was able to somewhat finish his vision with respect to this movie and I was able to see it. It corrects so many issues with the original release and brings much needed context to some of the characters and scenes.Don't get me wrong, this film also had its issues particularly with regard to some of the cgi and lack of music in some sections of the film, but the overall story and additional story telling more than made up for it.I loved all of the Cyborg story line and how he decided to use his powers for good by helping the poor, but extremely kind waitress as well as the additional battle scenes with the Amazon's, Atlanteans and ancient flashback battle. Also loved the fact that they left out all of the cheeseball destitute Russian family scenes.I do have mixed feelings about the long look at the post apocalyptic earth scene at the end as I think they could have saved some of it for future movies but it seems like the story is headed in the right direction assuming the studio execs keep their damn hands out of way and let Snyder do his thing...The jag offs that interfered the first time around should all be fired.Giving this film a solid 8 and looking forward to more films in the Snyderverse.", "So much better!!!": "So happy that this film was made. Although it may be long, the story is much more complete. Just what these iconic characters deserve. It's such a better version, you get to know some of the characters a lot better, while introducing other characters from the DC univers. The story has much more depth. Defiantly hoping for sequels!", "This is what we wanted \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c": "This movie may not be perfect but it's what the fans wanted.

In This movie ,there's a lot of a fight scenes .As compared to 2017 justice league ,Fights are epic in snyder's version. The way of snyder's presentation for each Character is really phenomenal.

Lastly I will say, it's a really awesome movie.", "The DC film that everyone wanted": "Synder's cut is the film that fans deserved in 2017. While the version of 2017 was a mediocre superhero movie without character development and a basic storyline, the synder's cut is INTENSE, every character is well developed finally giving more attention to the story of The flash and the are a lot of extra details in the story that turned this movie in one of the best in his genre.", "Omg dc is on": "Plzzz snyder you have to create justice league 2 and 3 and 4 and alwaye keep it on because we fans want all the justice league plz plz plz we want moreeee", "All you can hope for!": "Well well we finally got it!

Better character development. This is what we all wanted to see and we got it.", "Impressive and redeeming film": "While I'm no fan of of the preceding Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice film, I will admit the director really redeemed himself he with his cut of Justice League. The story was engaging, the pacing was well done, the action was great and it provided a badly needed viewer connection to the lesser known characters. Nothing felt forced in this film. These are all areas the theatrical release missed on....in a big way. I highly recommend this film, especially if the original theatrical release left a bad taste in your mouth.", "Fan Service -": "No doubt it is treat to fan.

But now in the new decade someone bigbrain take lead and make one of the best movie from dc universe. From original it have bigger timeline but it is worth your time. Every character get time to improve their stories with big finale.", "The super amazingly fantastic Zack Snyder version....in 4:3?!": "So, they spend all this time and money to do a super awesome version and they make the conscious choice to put it in 4:3?????!!!! Why would you screw it up that way?! I guess the pointless and stupid is the way of the studios, but why would an Artist choose this in today's day and age other than to be different. Dumb mistake by Snyder.As for the film, this is by far the best version of the film! It would be perfect if he would have left it in the original format instead of chopping it to be 4:3. I could feel the flashbacks of Watchmen in this version. The cool way he put that together, it felt like he took what he learned from Watchmen and used the right pieces to help this story in a unique way.The irony of what Snyder did here is that we don't know who will be playing the characters fir the next Justice League movie. Batman is being replaced along with Superman. It looked like he did some reshoots and added the Jared Leto Joker back in, but is that who will play the Joker in the JL films moving forward?Well, it seems that the DC team is a lot less organized than the Marvel team ever was. Hopefully, they can pull a plan together to capitalize off the successes they've had and this film in particular.", "DC fans got what they deserved": "Snyder cut is the best amalgation of BvS & MOS, story brilliantely continues ahead...direction, vfx, acting everything is on spot. Especially the character development of flash & cyborg. And this time Batfleck is the one we wanted after BvS not like cheap tony stark in JOSSTICE LEAGUE.Must watch movie!!!!", "Make your own future - make your own past": "The fans and Snyder has forever altered the history of cinema by making sure this film was finished and released.Warner Brothers through their own failure brought in the avengers director to turn it into a shallow comedy because they believed their audience is the same... They were wrong.In the real justice league the redemption, we get serious, heartfelt and important character arcs that you genuinely care about.", "I've seen Every \"Comic's movie\" this is the best so far.": "First Superhero's movie I've ever seen was back to 2006, when i watched Spider-man.\nNow i can say, this is best superheros' movie.\n4hrs? it based like 4min, I hadn't been amused by a long film like I did with this movie.\nThe pacing was great, the characters are humans, as they should be, the story is more explained, the porpoises and the enemies are great.\nI hope to see the whole ((Snyder's verse)) comes out.", "Beautifully shot. Way better story.": "Real life, now I'm sad there aren't going to be more. This was really cool. It looked great. The acting was incredibly good in this cut, which means Whedon's cut just didn't know how to capture these performers. It was long and I think it would have been a great miniseries. I watched it in three sittings. I'll definitely check it out again though!", "The high reviews are not wrong here.": "I decided to give this a go while traveling to see my son and it made the plane flight extremely forgettable and way more fun. This was excellent, entirely balanced, worth every minute of the 4 hours and very very creative. I'm not the biggest Snyder fan but I would call this his greatest film so far and very good overall. This is a badass comic book movie and up there with the Nolan's Batman's as another favorite DC movie of mine. Hell of a tone, great music, fluid storytelling and awesome cinemaphotography and effects. The character development and depth was really good too. There is no reason to ever watch the original if not maybe for a study in everything that went askew and to compare and contrast. I personally think Ben Affleck's Batman arguably encapsulates the Dark Knight better than anyone before him though many have also done a great job their own. This film did the Justice League and fans justice. Highly recommend.", "Great film amazing": "Really great story and great cast makes the best film of the year.", "Why was this not OK'd for theatrical in the first place": "I'm surprised after watching this straight without stopping why was this not OK'd for the theatrical cut? Honestly this movie exceeded my expectation without a doubt. My only regret is that I watched the 2017 Whedon version. Either way this is a whole new movie. Not biased and honest opinion. This 4 hours went without even realizing that it took 4 hours.\nEvery character has their own arc in the story and it's more believable. This is the perfect movie to build up for the justice league and rest of the characters. Ends perfectly for wanting more for Aquaman movie, Flash movie, Cyborg movie and Batman movie. Also obviously the Superman move/ MoS 2. Honestly when it ended I wanted more. This is just epic DC super hero 4 hour worth content. Just take it all in.", "Get that RETRO feel good....I think...": "So lets get the elephant out of the room first.\nHow about that aspect ratio? Talk about retro, do\nnot adjust your set...It took some time to adjust,\nbut eventually the movie was enough to distract\nme from the obvious elephant in the room.\nI understand about the different aspect ratios\nand it has to do with the hardware used to create\nthe film and what it will be released on.\nWe do not need another debate, but lets ask, what\nis the biggest market? Will most people see new releases\nin Imaxx? In Theaters? At home in 16x9(177/1) HD?\nMoving forward, this is a no brainer.\nAnyway, on to the movie. There is alot of new\nmaterial here and I love so many different scenes\nspecific to each character. This was a real treat.\nThere is also a lot of fill, like scenes that kind\nof lasted too long with little to no effect. Perhaps\nthis had something to do with the Imax format, most\nof the movie just doesn't seem HD. This is not specific\nto character shots, but the overall scene or background.\nIt's a mixed bag for sure. At the end or after we win,\nthis becomes super obvious and I have no clue what I'm\nwatching.\nIn the end, it is a different version in many ways\npositive and in other ways, negative. There is so much\nnew here, it could have easily been released as a stand\nalone mini series released on the 16x9 aspect ratio with\nmore attention to the over all scene quality and resolution.\nWorth watching? Hell yes, but for me, the theatrical\nrelease can stand on it's own.JD", "Felt like a different Movie": "When I watched The Justice League in 2017, I had found it a waste of my 2 and a half hours. DC unfortunately hadn't been able to deliver quality products and after years of disappointments, I would have never thought I'd give a 10 star for a DC movie but here we are.Before going into detail, I believe I should point out the most important difference. This movie is fun! I had almost fell asleep while watching JL17. The 2 hours and a half had felt like a life time. On the contrary, I didn't notice how fast time past while watching this 4 hours version.I'll be honest. I didn't expect anything from this version. How could the JL17 be any better? What could Zack possibly do to save this mess? And 4 hours?But you understand the difference right from the start. The feelings, emotions, the power hits you. You quickly understand this movie is a lot more series now.In this version, we get to see all the characters in more detail. Backgrounds, ties, what drives them is clearly shown. Remember how people said the flash and Batman were useless? I thought that too, until I watched this. It's crazy how perception can alter with just a few touches.The use of music has also been one of the major problems in the recent DC movies. Like CGI, DC developed a habit of overusing \"epic\" music in scenes. You hear some epic music, your senses tell you that something epic should be happening but your logic says no.Zack Snyder fixed that, with successfully using the music, as a tool to elevate the scenes, not overshadow them.Speaking of logic, this version also successfully ties the events with one an other. While watching JL17 I remember feeling left out, something is happening but I didn't know how or why.Finally, one of the reasons why this version feels so different is that Snyder actually changed some scenes, and I absolutely loved them. It was an amazing feeling thinking I knew what would happen but it didn't. Zack either changed some scenes or removed them completely.Well done Zack Snyder, and thank you, for bringing the HOPE back to the DC Cinematic Universe. Maybe S does stand for HOPE afterall.", "WORTH IT!!!": "Absolutely worth it, this is what we wanted and zack always known that.", "This, is the movie you were waiting for...": "\"Josstice\" League was poor. We know it. A movie butchered, rewritten, reshot, slashed and edited into an almost incoherent mess. We won't go into why, it's been said a thousand times. It's out there, it's done.Very rarely do we get a second chance with movies. Happened with the Exorcist prequel. In that instance, both movies turned out to be bland.Not this. No, this is a great movie. Plotholes erased, a true sequel to BvS (ultimate edition), a proper plot. Its not a different movie, the good bits from Josstice are still here. Even Whedon knew to keep them in. It's 80% identical plot, just done differently.The main two heroes, Batman and Superman are really on the back burner with much more plot given to Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Flash but especially Cyborg. The beating heart and pathos of the film. Ray Fisher gives soul to his role without descending into self pity. Ezra Miller too is far more rounded and a lot less cowardly than the other variation.Are there flaws? A few, some CG is a bit substandard but Snyder was working with a far reduced budget so no blame there. I didn't like the aspect ratio of 4.3. Its a pure IMAX ratio but does not suit a home TV. Luckily I could zoom the picture in to the edge of my TV screen and thankfully Snyder has framed all credits and action to allow that.It ties in beautifully with BvS and the epilogue? Holy moley. We need a sequel and it needs to be to this movie. This movie needs to be made canon and all that follow need to follow this movies threads. I've seen all the DCU movies (except Birds of Prey, I had to turn that off) and none of them make this movie apocryphal. More please!", "Snyderverse experience": "Man of Steel was a cool take on a modern day Superman, but always felt something was lacking.BvS had underwhelming action sequences (other than Batman rescue scene) that were disappointing. I oddly understood and enjoyed the direction Snyder was going in, even though it wasn't perfectly executed.JL was awesome. I really enjoyed the 4 hours. It took time to develop new characters while extending or improving the action. I cannot believe the intro to the Flash was removed from the theatrical cut, mind boggling. Also think the best part of the Snyder cut is the villain. Way more intimidating and has purpose. Really well done.", "Amazingly detailed and much more coherent than the theatrical cut !": "Zack Snyder finally got to finish his long awaited JL and boy did he bring it.Now there are several scenes you have seen before if you saw the theatrical cut, which was a pure disappointment compared to this movie. But after about an hour / an hour and a half things really start to show the difference between the two iterations.I loved Man of Steel and Batman V Superman - Dawn of Justice ( Ultimate Edition ) ( remember to see the Ult. Edt. People as this has 30 minutes more footage and gives you much more understanding to what Zack Snyder was trying to do ). Also the plot about a bomb in the Capitol comes off way different in the Ult. Edt. And gives a completely different perspective on the character which had lost his legs during Superman/Zod fight.4 hours - Flew by me and I enjoyed very much of the movie. Now the movie is not perfect, but no movie is. However if the theatrical cut had an avg. Rating of 6.2 this is easily an 8 in avg. Everything below 7 is a BS rating. Now I love both Marvel and DC but ever since I was a kid and saw Superman fly across the television set with Christopher Reeves as Superman, Superman has been my favorite character him and Batman ( Nostalgia watching Batman 1989 with Keaton my God ). But credits needs to be shown to Marvel for their take on their universe ... Robert DJ as Tony Stark ... Priceless he cannot be replaced by a longshot. Much respect for Robert DJ to turn his life around and then make Marvels universe one of the best franchises ever seen on the big screen !For a Superhero Assemble for the DC universe this can pretty much hold its own against Avengers from 2012 and Avengers Age of Ultron. Eventhough Zack Snyder had to introduce both Cyborg and Flash to be more interesting characters and liked personalities. Something the theatrical cut simply did not do ... Especially Cyborg is a huge deal in this cut - His background his heart and person.The best parts in the new edition from Zack Snyder however is Ray Fisher as Cyborg - he truely is the heart of the story with such a kind and compassioned person. And Ezra Millers Flash ... He is without a doubt the MVP of the movie as he basically saves the entire JL twice.Whatever Warner Bros was thinking about preventing Zack Snyder to do his thing, he sure proved them wrong with this cut. And I can for the love of my life not understand why a production company would hire a director as Zack Snyder to make these movies and then try to ruin his vision and interfere with his proces. Its sad to have witnessed and Warner Bros sure ruined their chance to compete with Marvels very well setup universe.Marvel is doing their thing ... Wish DC could have done theirs in their own way and not trying to copy from Marvel !Bottom line ... Zack Snyders Justice League is something special and I recommend all who has the time and enjoys Superheroes ( Marvel or DC it does not matter ) just enjoy the movie in all its glory !", "More Snyderverse please": "Shattered expectations - by far the best DC movie to come out of the DCEU, and after Snyder's Batman v. Superman cut, I had lofty expectations for this one too. It's a fun plot and has exciting action that has matured beyond the over-the-top Man of Steel destruction.The exposition for each character, especially in the case of Cyborg, was appreciated greatly. I hope he gets his own movie soon.What impressed me most was the cohesion of the different stories weaved into the overall arc. Nothing felt out of place, and everything felt necessary to the development. The movie is 4 hours long which caused me to fear that it might feel too episodic, but it really was not. It felt like one long film and the time flew by.Fun symbolism: When Flash saves that girl he is crushing on from the car crash, and she's flying through the air as he looks at her lovingly and caresses her hair, there was some hilarious symbolism that Zach threw in. Flash stops caressing her, snapping himself out of his horny daydream, and grabs a hotdog floating next to her. He then sheathes the hot dog in his shirt pocket. Snyder was visually telling us \"keep it in your pants Barry\" and that made me laugh so hard.", "Horrible": "And way too long . Why is it his movies suck so bad? And way way too long I don't get what the hype was at all horrible acting also dc movies suck. Fire him and re group for real.", "A Major Victory for Film and Fans alike": "A lot of people know that I wasn't the biggest fan of Zack Snyder's superhero films (I actually walked out of both Watchmen and Dawn of Justice at the theaters well before the movies' were done). But his film's grow on you, as they grew on me. Perhaps It was out of sympathy that I started liking Zack Snyder's films after the horrible tragedy that his family suffered with the suicide of his daughter and the revelations that he had been forced out of directing 'Justice League' and that Joss Whedon had reshot the majority of the movie poorly but nowadays, I like Zack Snyder's films a lot more.Sadly, I saw Justice League's Whedon Cut years ago, but it left a lasting impression at how bad it was. And I was hoping when I heard rumor of the Snyder Cut that it would get a release. After about a year of waiting, I made my peace with the possibility that it would not get released. Then the official news came out with the trailers dropping. And I allowed myself hope that the film would be so good that Snyder would be brought back in to finish his proposed DC production, which more and more sounds like the DC equivalent of Lord of the Rings. Sadly, even with the movie's success, I overshot my hopes about Zack Snyder and DC working together. But enough about sad history, I think it's time to sing some praises.The film is far and beyond what the theatrical cut was. The action is well done, like pretty much all of the Snyder films I have seen. There is some blood and violence, but only a little R Rated.Tom Holkenborg's score is also a great enhancement to the film. Far better than Danny Elfman's score, which basically just was a poorly cobbled-together production, like Whedon's Cut. I really enjoyed the new theme for the Amazons, which evokes memories of Snyder's 300 adaptations. Most of the music is very memorable, which I find a rare thing nowadays in Superhero films.The acting is great, too. I did like Ezra Miller's performance, and Ray Fisher was much more solidly expanded upon with his character that was originally supposed to be the 'heart of the film'. In comparison to his performance in Dawn of Justice alone, Ben Affleck is much more likable as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Jason Momoa is, as usual, a lovable rogue with a hidden heart of gold in the form of Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Gal Gadot does a lot of butt-kicking in this film, but she still performs her role with grace and wonder-fully so. And Henry Cavill gives a great performance as Superman, and probably his last if things are to believed with DC and Warner Bros' reported reboot.The villains are fantastic, also. Ciaran Hinds, the King beyond the Wall, steals each scene as General Steppenwolf, now portrayed with a much more terrifying body but an honestly sympathetic story. I actually felt for him at parts of the film, despite the horrific things he does and has done. Peter Guinness is chilling as Desaad (though I personally always imagined Brad Dourif in the role), and Ray Porter's brief appearances as Darkseid are on the same level of scary and intimidating as Sauron in all six Middle-Earth films. He's a lot more scarier, appropriately, than Thanos in Infinity War and Endgame, but that's a whole 'nother story there.For me, a guy who likes long films, the film really just flew by. I really didn't mind the four-hour runtime. Everything just seems to fit into place and feels good. When I finished the movie, it left a good taste in my mouth. However, that taste did not last as I realize that there will probably never be a sequel to this film, which is truly sad and makes everything bittersweet. If, by some chance, the sequels do get made, I hope Zack at least writes the scripts.#RestoretheSnyderverse.", "Just as we needed this doesn't need any words to explain.": "Just watch it if you want to see a dark superhero film for first time and you can continue on Amazon's The Boys.\nWell Darkness aside this movie shows if the creativity control is totally in the Hand of director it can be from the most Okish movie to one of the most celebrated movie in the cinema history.\nWell, Sir Zack has done a good job for releasing it in it's full fledged length so most the characters were very well developed and the cast has their work amazing as the movie demanded which I appraised s much.\nA Final Sentence - DC fans can now hope to get a better DC universe.", "Great film. Why wasn't it released before": "If this 4 hour film somehow made it to screens in 2017, or even 2018, Avengers Infinity War and Endgame would've probably had a problem and would've had to REALLY up their story game and pull something huge off...Oh well. Atleast this got to see the light", "When mediocrity transforms to excellence.": "A popcorn action movie turned into an artistic epic. Major impressive transformation that engages you from start to end without realizing that you have spent 4 hour watching a remastered piece of art.Well done 10/10.", "Something wicked (and awesome) this way comes": "I'm actually one of those people who quite enjoyed the last two entries to the Snyder DCEU saga while still noticing its' flaws and understanding its' ambition. I respected the move behind the release of this version and initially, I wasn't really expecting much before watching this knowing it's the same plot as the 2017 one, which I kinda enjoy but thought it was mediocre and quite forgettable. But, man, how pleasantly surprised I was and honestly, shocked, to find out how different and amazing this turned out to be. It's not even the same movie anymore.Right off the bat, the tone and atmosphere feels darker, unlike the moroseness of 'Batman v Superman' but more closer to 'Man of Steel'. There's something more at stake and tension is built up from the beginning. But, it's not all doom and gloom since we get to see our heroes living their lives before coming together to fight the big baddie Steppenwolf.The thing that frustrated me the most with the older version is how nothing made much impact within the story going forward. This version on the other hand, puts emphasis on small moments throughout each scene and adds weight to its' proceedings. Two of the main characters, namely Cyborg and Flash, are given much more screen time than they were ever given before, fleshing them out more in the process. Intricate details within the story gets a few amount of spotlight, making the world feel grand, richer and much more immersive. Also something that stood out to me is how much more violent and adult this version comes off, and it's all the better for it.Another real upgrade I'd like to mention is the villain of this story, Steppenwolf. This time around, he's given more to work with and has a better design to his character. You get a sense of what his motivations are and what drives him to do all the things he does, instead of just being a cartoonishly bad antagonist. There's a saying that a movie is only as good as its' conflict. Luckily, he stepped up to the plate (pun intended). And there's another looming presence (that I won't spoil for the sake of your enjoyment) that adds an extra sense of urgency and dread.The only real gripe I have with this is some of the pacing issues and odd choices that were made and may seem unnecessary, which is ultimately nitpicky and doesn't deter my enjoyment of this movie that much, although for some people it might (you'll know it when you see it). I could argue it works better as a miniseries since it's divided in parts but as a whole it could still use some trimming down a bit.Personally, I think it's up there with some of the best superhero movies. I would say it's one of the best iterations of the DCEU, after 'Wonder Woman' and 'Shazam' and I almost wished that I never watched the 2017 Justice League, now that I've witnessed the original intention for this story. It dwarves that version's worth in quality and only goes to show that you could never rush art for the sake of profit. I'd definitely recommend it even to casual fans who are not that invested in this franchise to give this one a try.And there's gotta be a sequel after this.", "An extraordinary remake - An other movie": "An extraordinary remake of Justice League by Zack Snyder! It's a different movie, nothing like the first version of Justice League. A must-see. Caught up in this 3 hour film from start to finish without stopping. This movie shows the importance of a good director. The introduction of new characters is not forgotten, which contributes to its understanding and charm.", "Proves WB They're Wrong": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is the peak Version of what a justice league movie should be, a much much better vision than the theatrical version, he makes every character relateable with real emotion and three dimensional, what a surprise WB doesn't choose this version, but instead go with a bright-cheap joke-weird version on 2017, well then WB, this should be the one justice league that canon", "Now this movie talks": "I can understand Warner Bros at some point that there are still some unnecessary scenes which are needed to be cut in my opinion, 4 hours is too long so the movie could be shortened to achieve its proper duration time.Movie is great, absolutely fantastic. Story line is good, action is good. Now you can make a connection between BvS and Justice League, so BvS makes more sense now.This movie could be something like 3 hours or a bit more for Cinemas, and the movie could hit to top at box office in my opinion, but sadly WB missed this chance by blocking Zack Snyder original movie in the beginning.", "Best Dc movie so far": "When this movie came out, I was hesitant at first to watch it but once I watched it I didn't regret it. I mean this movie was jaw dropping and I wished they could just continue the snyder verse in the DCEU. The fight scene is awesome and the well-written dialogues, climaxes and messages delivered to the audience were spot on. Even though the score for wonder woman was not my best, I still loved the score for the flash and the one-liners delivered by the awesome cast, kudos to Zack snyder for restoring the dc universe and the great team behind this awesome movie.Thank you Zack Snyder.", "The biggest waste of 4 hours I've ever had": "If I wanted to watch the exact same movie apart from some slow mo and a few added minutes of useless content I wouldn't have bothered. The trailer was extremely misleading. I was expecting at least half an hour of joker content, not a Bruce Wayne dream sequence. I was very excited for this and I couldn't have been more disappointed. Not true to the comics in anyway shape or form. Why is Batman carrying a gun? Why is he promising to kill the joker? Batman does not kill. It's a disrespect to the original comics and I understand trying to put a spin on things but The Dark Knight trilogy already perfected that. Altogether it's an absolute waste of time. Just watch the original, you won't be mislead by the Joker", "Not worth it": "Starting watching it after 30 minutes that was enough.", "Same boring, different day": "Frankly I don't see what this version brings to an already bad story. Maybe the root is that DC didn't have ten movies to build a vilain story. This one stills feels like a patchwork of disjointed scenes, artificially stitched together and the new cut still doesn't fix this.", "Way overhyped": "Of course, it is better than the theatrical release, because it is 4 hrs long now. Generally, I liked the change of tone and atmosphere of the movie. The dialogues improved and the characters got some development. But damn, so many unnecessary scenes and slow-motion, CGI is better now, but still is meh.The most upsetting thing is that it somehow is getting higher ratings than Spiderman: Into the spider-verse, and even the Avengers for Christ's sake .I feel like people are just extremely overhyped and compare it with a theatrical release and not as a standalone film. Although, I am happy for Zack and definitely you can enjoy your time watching this movie. But I guess 4 hours can be spent for something way better.P.S. I rated the previous one as a 2.5, but this one is 3.5 max.", "Absolutly Fantastic!": "... and you know it's a different movie in first second!Mr Snyder put a lot of work into this one!

Here, we're talking the way Zack Snyder retells stories about superheroes. I'm fine with any kind of story.Apart from the aspect ratio and other complaints e.g the glaring awful CGI, too many slow mos and whatnot, the film delivers what moviegoers deserve: Good storytelling, strong characters and lovely shots/visual; surely, movies do have flaws.

She was so wrong, i'm not surprised she will probably be promoted for being so talentless...what a world we're living in...talent is now punished by being fired and incompetence is promoted...So, this movie is a solid tribute to each characters, each part being better than the movies dedicated solely to these character.....It gives you everything, smiles, goosebumps, tears...the lot, just sit, take a good pause in your life and watch it..no spoilers here, just pure joy..I've ordered the 4K bluray and at the moment i don't even own a 4K bluray reader..There are many many many Superheroes movies currently but this one is a reference that anyone in the business should take as a blueprint.

Your 16:9 ration wide screen just got smaller.

Hopefully we can get a sequel to this amazing masterpiece some day because this was just cinema. Best DCEU movie ever made.", "Still sh#%": "The movie is basically the same from 2017 without some jokes. Darkseid is bad just for being bad and the CGI is awful. The Flash is a disappointment and his jokes are not funny. Aquaman basically says \"Mah man\" in the film and that's his contribution. Batman is sad (like Ben Affleck who doesn't wanted to be on this movie) basically does nothing as well and is useless for the overall success. They try to develop Cyborg, but the sadness and motivations of the character are too much \"teenage-like\" and he is just boring and lame after all. They're all basically useless because when they resurrect Superman he takes care of all the beating of Steppenwolf (another tasteless villain with bad CGI) and the team does nothing. Of course they had to use time travel to save everything in an orgasmatic scene for Zack Snyder who has nothing to do with anything. There is a scene where MARTHA talks with Lois Lane about their grief and how they miss Clark. It would be a beautiful scene, but we find out that MARTHA was actually Martian Man Hunter (???). Why? In the last scene of the movie he goes to Batman and says that if Darkseid returns he can help the Justice League, but why he didn't help when Steppenwolf invaded??? The last scene comes out of nowhere and makes no sense since the problem that would result in Batman's dream is solved and Superman is not bad. The dialogue between Batman and the Joker is so off and cringe that I don't how people are enjoying it. So, the movie is basically made out of hype and fan-service with multiple scenes that aren't necessary. Zack Snyder has turned in some type of god or savior for his fans and that's very bad for cinema because he is not a good director, he has become a character of himself believing that he is a hero and throwing 4:3 perspectives, slow motion and Black&White like it's the biggest thing in filmmaking.", "2 long 2 dumb": "It feels like the movie is just made for its scale.

However, this is a major improvement from the original. For example, cyborg was given his much needed elaboration, and steppenwolf was much more bearable. But overall this movie is still flawed in it's core.5/10: nice but not that good.", "A Modest Improvement": "Relative to the theatrical version, Zack Snyder's cut of Justice League does generally move the needle toward the positive end, but it doesn't solve all the problems of its predecessor, and it ends up creating a few of its own.Positives are that the cast are mostly giving it their all, Ben Affleck, especially, deserves high praise for his take on a world-weary Bruce Wayne/Batman. The added Flash and Cyborg material fleshes them out, but both have the drawbacks of being \"too much\"; more on that below. The redesign of Steppenwolf is excellent, and the actual appearances of Darkseid are good. The entire back half of the film is mostly an improvement over the theatrical version, especially the action climax.Drawbacks that keep the film from being a complete success are the running time; one thing where the theatrical version comes out ahead is that the exposition bringing the audience up to speed is done during the opening credits montage, the Snyder Cut takes an hour to relay the same information, and it becomes tedious. There are many scenes, that if they were too truncated in the theatrical version, are not trimmed enough for the Snyder Cut and it hurts the overall pacing. The best line of the previous version, which serves Batman and the Flash, is missing here. While some important scenes for the characters of the Flash and Cyborg are added back, they're also given \"too much\" for the story being told. For the Flash, it is Ezra Miller's \"adorable\" schtick, the awkwardly endearing nerd gets old fast. And it goes on well passed the the point of tedium. Cyborg is given what amounts to a \"God mode\"; Justice League comic writers sometimes admit that they have trouble coming up with stories that couldn't be solved by Superman alone, well here it's difficult to know why Cyborg needs any help sometimes. The \"Knightmare scene\" doesn't really make much sense here, bogging down the resolution of the film with what screams like a desperate attempt of a writer/director getting hired for a sequel. And much to my personal displeasure, Zack Snyder refuses to let the character of Superman actually BE Superman. Say what you want about Joss Whedon shoehorning in all manner of tone whiplash humor, but at least he actually let Superman have a likeable personality.Still, for all it's faults, the Snyder Cut is worth a shot, and mostly improves on the earlier version.", "Worse than the original cut (yes, really)": "I'm not the biggest fan of the original cut, or Whedon, or DC, or superheroes movies for that matter, but is this supposed to be a joke or something? How can this thing be so overpraised? This is 4 hours of absolutely nothing, dude. Sorry, actually it is something. It's just an overcooked leftover of a movie, filled with the absolutely worst of Zack Snyder's repertoire.You needed slow-mo in your life? Well, you are getting it in this \"movie\". This guy can't live without goddamn super-slow motion. One hour into the movie I was getting so much of it that I was ready to cut my wrists off. Then you got slow-mo within slow-mo, thanks to Flash, of course. It already becomes self-parody. And I know that the dude has a fetish over that same old shtick (since 2006 he's doing it) and I knew from the get-go what I was gonna have. But man, I guess deep inside I was hoping for this guy to grow the hell out of it, to become a little mature. But no, he still thinks it's epic to include slow-mo in every action scene. How can he not understand that this is not epic, it's not amazing, but dumb to abuse the slow-mo?? And jeez, I am aware that the original cut had it too, but this is another whole level of stupidity.Look, I can talk for hours and hours about all the unnecessary scenes this cut presents (which were edited off from the original cut), but I think the biggest insult is the last 30 minutes or so (the so-called 'epilogue'). Say what you want about the original cut, at least they had the decency to give the movie a \"proper\" closure. This one sequel-baits in a really insulting way, throws at you a bunch of totally irrelevant characters and leaves you shamelessly in your chair, wondering about the meaning of life and about the 4 hours of your life you have completely wasted. Some Snyder fanboys will defend this cut on the basis that it develops the characters better. Does it really? Obviously in the original cut the characters felt so rushed, so bland and shallow that I can see why people feel that way. But come on people, seriously? How can anybody think that these characters are well developed? You gave Cyborg maybe some daddy issues, and that's it, dude. In fact, everybody has father issues in this!! I guess that counts as character development for these people... Oh, this cut also includes a really creepy scene with Flash and some girl that, unless you read the comics, you won't know who she is, or why the hell is in this movie. And, like I say, the scene is creepy and predatory as hell and yet it tries to be... romantic? Funny? I don't know. Words can't possibly tell how I hated that scene. By the way, the Song to the Siren doesn't deserve to be butchered in this fashion. It's true that, in this version, Darkseid actually appears and the resolution of the main antagonist (Steppenwolf) is way better. Did 4 hours make up for all that? Idk, you tell me.The square format. Oh boy, what a failure of a choice. Did it add anything at all? Well, nobody has watched it in IMAX, so the answer is no. I watched it in streaming and it sucked, plain and simple. Even that they couldn't get right!Other than that, this movie carries the same problems the original cut had. Nothing makes sense, the villain motivations are dumb and, although it's a superhero movie, everybody looks super intense and the colors are so dark, as if it takes itself as seriously as some really heavy drama. The characters are annoying, robotic and devoid of personality. Flash as the comic relief is pure cringe, and Wonder Woman has shovel face throughout the movie. Don't get me wrong, Gal Gadot is so cool, but in this movie she has nothing to work for, kinda sad actually.All in all, this is, as Roger Ebert would say, chewing gum for the mind (just figure chewing gum for 4 hours). All I want is that, some day, superhero movies fall out of fashion. I am totally honest, the genre doesn't hold up anymore, not as if it ever was amazing. I don't care whether it's DC, or Marvel, but if we are so desperate now that we are trying to reimagine new cuts for your crappy movies, it really needs to die out. I guess it will continue to live on until the profits begin to drop. 3/10.", "Holy freaking moly was this movie great!!!": "I couldn't even finish JL 2017, and had pretty low expectations for this one. I was dead wrong! It was a masterful job by Snyder bordering on a work of art. If any movie was made to watch while \"elevated\", this is the one. I was in a trance for just about the entire 4 hours.", "Restore The Snyder Verse": "I don't care how many movies WB made outside DCEU. WB can restore Snyder Verse. They never ignore, not us united.", "So this is 10/10 for me. The 2017 would be a solid 2/10": "I don't even know how the other went past screening and went to the cinema. It was such a horrible movie. Now it all makes sense when I watch this version.Probably the other one were directed by a child? I have no idea.", "MUST WATCH - Masterpiece": "Finally some justice in the way this movie has been told and the time given to each individual superhero!!!!! AMAZING", "After thoughts": "After 8 months, I've reviewed my thoughts, whilst it's still a solid 10 star the only quip I have is too much slow mo, the movie would be shorter and fit on 1 disc. Nearly 25 minutes is slow motion.Some scenes need it but it's dragged out.Still bloody good though,I don feel the snyder verse needs zack to carry on but they should continue certain parts like darkseid and cyborg.", "Spectacular Snyder Cut": "This was a great movie. Much better than the 2017 version by Whedon. While at 4 hours it may seem overlong and at times, over dramatic, it is still pretty awesome and spectacular. Quite a few scenes had me smiling, satisfied, like the first action scene with Wonder Woman near the beginning. This version is much darker and violent and has a few F bombs which is why the R rating. The team united kicks ass, especially at the final battle scene with Steppenwolf. He is much more intense and threatening in this cut. A battle with the Amazonians in the beginning is brutal as he cuts them down and flings them and their horses around like rag dolls.\nThis movie is nothing like the Whedon version which I still liked even though I knew it could have been so much better. It puts his to shame. This is the vision and version the DC fans deserved and what should have been released in 2017. It has some intense and emotional moments. The return of Superman is a lot better and Superman's black suit is much more appropriate as it fits right in with the dark tone of the movie.\nI know a lot of fans don't like Affleck as Batman, but I thought he was good and did his own take on the character. He is certainly the glue and leader the team needed to bring them all together United.\nIf this movie gets bad reviews, it will be from Marvel fans who love to criticize and tear apart DC movies. They think all Marvel films are great when not all are. To name a few...Iron Man 2, Doctor Strange, Spiderman Homecoming, the Fantastic Four reboot, Thor Darkworld and I thought Endgame was good, not great, and also overhyped and overrated.\nI hope to see JL 2 in the future. Maybe HBO Max will pick up on it as a movie or mini series. I will definitely see it. Until then, I'll be watching the Snyder cut again soon. Did not disappoint except for the 4.3 degree ratio on the tv screen with black bars on the side. But even that was no big deal and I soon looked past it early on watching the movie.", "'Justice League (2017)' was 6/10, but this is a fantastic 9/10": "Well done Zack Snyder... you did a fantastic job... It really is unfortunate that Zack couldn't just have told the production companies to go stuff themselves when they interfered with his movie, because then the previous 2017 version would have been much better than a 6/10 movie.... but I understand... the director just directs the movie, and often HAS to bend the knee to the production companies of the movie.This film is fantastically long (4hours) but I'll be honest with you: At NO point during the movie did I look at my watch or feel bored... the movie had my fullest attention all the way through, and that in itself is an achievement. The more than 2hours of extra footage added to the movie really not only ties up a lot of the loose ends that the previous movie suffered from, but it also added whole new story archs, villains and even new heroes.I seriously enjoyed this movie, and I'd watch it 10 times before I watch the 2017 even once again. The 4hours runtime was great and I almost wished it could have shown some more backstory for the heroes. 9/10, hands down the best DC movie since 'The Dark Knight Rises (2012)', and by far the best movie in the 'DC Extended Universe' yet!", "BIBLICAL EFFECTS......": "This move will literally have you praying at the edge of your seat, and that's know lie!!!", "Nup, nup, nup!!!": "Urghh. Maybe the 4:3 ration and B&W work in a cinema but not at home on high contrast 4K TV's. Couldn't get past the first 10mins. I'll happily sit down and watch a classic in that but this just didn't work. You can call it nuanced or inventive or whatever other cliched garbage you can think of but nup, no way! If you're going to do a B&W film... do it properly. (i.e. Schindler's List)", "I lift my home thearter couch fully satisfied": "For a DCEU fan, The Snyder Cut is a the most satisfying movie ever released. The story line is captivating. The character development are very well sequenced. Personally, I watched it several times in its entirety. Every time admiration for Zack Snyder increased.That said, I don't blame the WB execs for hiring Joss Whedon to add some humor and light things up. The move is literally very dark in tone and in image quality. It is a serious adult superhero movie.I commend Joss for coming in med project and salvaging what was left as a dogs breakfast due to the conflicts between Zack and the WB execs.If you're expecting it to be Thor Ragnarok, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a Snyder movie, and curious about what Snyder's vision was for this franchise, you'll be blown away! You might even shed some tears of joy!", "Unexpectedly awesome": "I didn't understand all the fuss leading to it's release, and when I heard it was a four hour movie I just thought it must be some kind of ego trip. I loved it though. Darker and more mature than marvel, not better but different, which is ideal really. Amazing action sequences and a decent and coherent story. What is really shocking is just how much of what makes it good was cut for the theatrical release. I can see why Snyder would feel insulted to see his movie shredded into a jumbled and superficial mess and I think it's great he had the opportunity to restore it. I hope this version will be continued.", "Worth the watch": "It's long, but it does not drag if you pace it. I watched in 2 instalments & found it a vast improvement over the choppy theatrical version. The Snyder cut fleshes our the heroes & their individual journeys to the final climatic show down. The movie finishes off with a surprising epilogue that would have set up the planned Justice League sequels that I would love to see Snyder make one day. This movie was a satisfying and enjoyable experience.", "It's an epic": "Great character introduction especially cyborg&flash .. Amazing storytelling\nAnd very nice visual effects\nrestorethesnyderverse", "Exceeded all expectations!": "This movie is more than.. better than any of the avengers movies and all the things that made no sense in Whedon's version align perfectly here. They MUST create the follow up with DarkSeid.. and Martian man hunter - are your kidding??? Omg. This was not a movie we deserved, but more than that. The details, back story, character exploration, etc.. I could go on and on... new characters, alternate timelines or world lines.. one can really see how utterly decimated Zacks vision was and how much was undone in his absence. This movie even brought tears to my eyes in parts... in summary, yeah the avengers are great, etc but this work stands alone and sets an unparalleled standard for future projects in the DC universe.", "This movie saved further humiliation of DEEU.": "This is the best DC movie made after Nolan's batman trilogy. Zack Snyder really worked hard to bring this ultimate suff. Much better from the past edition which was a total blunder to begin with. This movie captures all parts in sequence and introduction of darkseid, martian man, green lantern were necessary to make it successful and worth watching. I'm hoping that next edition will be as good as this one.", "Restore the snyderverse": "At last beginning of the end\nI'm surprised how beautiful handcrafted work he has done that has been ripped from him for his unexpected family tragedy ..this would have been the most gross DC film ever . I'm sure they are regretting now\nLet him finish what he started\nHe has a beautiful vision no one can direct dc film with this much of dedication ..I felt his love for the fans and the DC universe hope WB listens", "YES! FINALLY, NEAR PERFECTION!": "This is everything the original should have been and more.\nAlmost everything from the original \"light popcorn\" version has been corrected, including the visuals. For me this might have had the best visuals of any DC/Marvel movie so far.\nThe characters were fleshed out, and there was some heart here.\nGreat job Zack, and thanks to HBO Max for getting this done.", "one of best super hero movies": "Its an extremely good and impressive elephant is definitely one of the best superhero movies. It was definitely better than the first version. It started really well, first of all, the scream scene was very deep instead of the ridiculous superman scene in the first movie. The ww scenes were not that good but they fixed the cgi. I was disgusted with that music playing in the background. The flash scenes were enormous. You will understand what I mean when you watch it. The batman was much better than the first movie but it was still not enough. Aquman would do it. It was good. In short is AMAZING.", "Excellent \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfa5": "This was truly an epic film. Glad he took control and added al the missing pieces. Well done and I enjoyed this version much better than the theater release. With this version you can really understand the whole story without a bunch of G rated baloney the first version had in it. I gave it a 10 if there were a higher number I'd give it more. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e you must watch it all with no interruptions \ud83d\ude09", "4 hours of agony": "My goodness, and I thought things can't get worse than the first movie, but it did with this one. The first movie was bad, but this was 100 times worse. Silly script and dialogue, poor performance, too many unbelievable mistakes. Glad I didn't waste my money watching this crap.", "A first of its kind, magnum opus, and resounding success": "I had never watched Man of Steel, BvS, or the original Joss Whedon's Justice League, but due to the buzz around this cut's release, I actually watched all three of Snyder's DC films back-to-back, starting with Man of Steel and ending with this movie on HBO Max.And what a movie it is! Having never watched the original cut, I cannot add to the chorus of reviews out there extoling how this cut is a radical improvement over its predecessor, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed pretty much every sequence in this movie. Even my wife, who is wholly disinterested in super hero movies and action flicks in general, sat glued to the couch through what can only be described as a unique viewing **experience**.The movie isn't perfect, which my score reflects, but this movie is groundbreaking. From its runtime to its auteurial idiosyncrasies bleeding out of its every frame, this is a kind of movie that hasn't, doesn't, and won't get made again. We don't come across such distilled auteurial realizations like this outside of independent art houses, but what we have here is basically a director's vision wholly unencumbered by commercial realities while also being produced from a Hollywood blockbuster budget. It's kind of an unbelievable combination that will likely secure this movie, along with its very unfortunate predecessor, as an incredible case study in film schools everywhere.Reflecting back on the MCU movies, Nolan's Batman trilogy, Tim Burton's Batman movies, and Christopher Reeve's Superman movies, I can with confidence say that Zack Snyder's Justice league is an operatic, auteurial epic of a film that also happens to be one of the best super hero movies ever made.", "This is it!! OUR Justice League": "This is it!! The real Justice League. It's kinda briliant the way they made it 4:3 At first it's quite strange for me then i just legit fell in love with it With the length 4hours was not bother me at all!! Cause it was like watching limited tv series Such an amazing movie. Obviously much better than the old one for me Better directing Better story telling Better length Better costume Awesome!!", "Everything we deserved": "This film, while long, was beyond brilliant. After a while, you get so sucked into the story, the length no longer matters.The cast were superb and Ray Fisher had the screen time and character development he deserved.\nAlso super pleased there was more of Jeremy Irons Alfred!An amazing film, with well developed characters, villains and motives.\nMy favourite DC movie as of now.", "More Than An Extended Cut, An Entirely New Experience": "Zack Snyders Justice League isn't simply an extended cut of the 2017 theatrical version of Justice League; it is a whole new experience. The runtime is doubled from 2 hours to 4 hours, there is a brand new score from Junkie XL, and the film is presented in a completely different aspect ratio.One thing that hasn't changed is the story. As I discussed in my review of the theatrical cut, the narrative is essentially the same, except here, it is allowed to play out at its own pace and is not butchered in the editing room. The story felt completely dull and rushed in the 2017 version, yet it feels complete and satisfying here. This version also presents the film in chapters. Given the film's length, the chaptered structure works very well here.The action scenes are much improved here, from the Amazonian fight sequence on Themyscira to the Wonder Woman hostage sequence, to the final fight. The editing is more cohesive and well-paced, creating more immersive action sequences. I still feel Snyder's action sequences lack enough weight to truly invest in them, as they often feel like video games, or at best, shot against a green screen. Nevertheless, they are an improvement over the previous versions.In Joss Whedon's theatrical cut, the focus felt very much on Bruce and Diana. Here, however, each member of the Justice League gets an equal amount of time in the spotlight. Cyborg, whose story was almost completely cut from the 2017 release, is given much more to do here, feeling like an actual human being instead of a CGI character whose sole purpose is to look cool. The final fight gives each team member something to do. All members feel vital during that final confrontation with Steppenwolf.Steppenwolf is also improved here, both from a visual and character perspective. His design in the 2017 film was atrocious. They attempted to make his features look human, even though he was extraterrestrial. The end result was a CGI-looking human that lacked any personality. Here, they change his design completely, making him much more alien, along with giving him a brand-new and improved costume. He is also given more character development here. We see that he is quite a pathetic villain who serves a more powerful master.The movie also does a great job of conveying the desperation the Justice League are in. This is done brilliantly by comparing them to the Age of Heroes and also with the death of Superman. Superman's power here is immense, and for the first time, we see just how powerful Henry Cavill's Man of Steel is. The scene in which he takes on all five members of the Justice League and beats them pretty easily was excellent.Most of the comedy seen in the 2017 cut is absent here, and to be frank, it isn't missed. It created a weird uneven tone, often feeling forced. Here, however, it feels like much more of a singular vision. The film is not devoid of humour, though. Ezra Miller's Barry Allen is undoubtedly intended as the movie's comedic relief. I found him pretty unfunny, however. Thankfully, the attempted humour is sparse.What drags this film down is its awful epilogue. It does nothing to progress the current story and feels like the most forced attempt to advertise a sequel. Given that Warner Bro's are not pursuing this sequel, it feels desperate on the part of Snyder, as if he's trying to start another fan campaign so that he can make his proposed movie. Unfortunately, by doing this, he sacrifices the quality of this movie. He brings in two of the most horrific villains in recent memory, Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and Jared Leto's Joker, for two interminable cameos. It is also clear that the film's cinematographer Fabian Wagner didn't shoot the apocalyptic vision we see during the epilogue. The whole visual style changes for this shot, and it looks incredibly similar to the cinematography of Snyder's other new film, Army of the Dead, in which Snyder himself was the cinematographer.And while this cut is undoubtedly the best version of the film, it still feels bloated. Where the theatrical cut was 2 hours long, and this version is 4 hours long, I believe the best possible version of this film is about 3 hours long. I would cut almost all of the epilogue, including the Lex Luthor scenes and the Knightmare dream sequence. I would cut all scenes with Martian Manhunter as it is nothing more than fan service and doesn't fit into the story in any way. The film also introduces J. K Simmons as Commissioner Gordon, yet he doesn't make an impact. He doesn't influence the plot, and his scenes could easily have been cut. In the end, the film would have worked so much better if it had ended on the shot of Superman ripping his shirt open to reveal his suit, in a lovely homage to Richard Donner's Superman.Overall, there are more positives than negatives here. Although more restraint was needed in the editing room, I am glad Snyder got to see through his original vision without studio interference. Love it or hate it, Snyder has brought his distinct vision to the screen.", "Better than the original one": "Amazing, would be better if they continue the movies series with the Snyder Verse. DCU is ruined, if they just listen to Zack Snyder it would be legendary.", "How can i join zack Snyder fan club": "Masterpiece\nAmazing\nSo good\nBest 4 hours.I need to rewatch it on 2k.", "Aminn": "This movis for zack snayder is the best for dc yes now im Enthusiastic for part 2 we wait so mush dc for this masterpice.", "FU***** beautiful.

This was far, far, far better than joss", "Hold your horses": "The theatrical cut of this film was a typical mindless holywood blockbuster, one where you forget what it was all about before the closing credits ends. And I have no problem with that. There are times when one just wants a bunch of explosions and jumping.Snyder's version is exactly the same, but infinitely more pretentious, pathetic, agendized, cringe stuffed, overstreched, self indulgent and, in a frantic desire to please all fans, ultimately spineless.Sorry Zack, but I gave up after about 100 minutes of this mess.", "It may not be just a movie that we wanted.... but it sure is the movie we needed!!!": "From the acting to the action, the story to the visuals, the heart to the score, this movie literally had it all!I, just as many people all over the world, have been waiting for THIS film since it was first announced that WB green lit the production for Justice League (2017), unfortunately this movie it to 2017, we had to wait until 2021 to see it, and to think, it took HBO Max and a pandemic to get this film to be seen the way it was intended to be seen.I won't give too much details away about this film but watch with an open mind and heart, it is best to watch knowing the history of these characters first to enjoy it even more, but dedicate these 4 hours and 2 minutes, it 4 hours and 22 minutes of your planning to use the restroom at least twice during the time of the movie, it is worth it and I don't say those words lightly.", "Definitely worth the time": "After rewatching the disaster that was Whedons Justice League, this was such a step up.", "A Cultural Epiphenomenon, The Definitive Version, An Epic Movie.": "Justice League 2017 was an insult to anyone who spent money on that movie. Incomplete CGI, cut and paste narrative, stupid jokes everywhere, plot holes...A mess. In a ridiculous attempt to copy the formula from another franchise and fall in the good graces of overrated movie pundits and critics (opinion makers) with media projection, who just want to see the same shiny pg-13 film with a different layer of paint , over and over again. You all know who they are.This movie by Zack Snider, is the polar opposite of the previous version.\nThe photography is stunning, the pacing is great for a 4-hour movie, the characters have depth, the richness of content and lore is overwhelming in a good way, the action is epic, and all the scenes flow like cinematic ballet, with a soundtrack which is simply magical.In addition, this movie has the merit of unequivocally refusing Marvel's super light formula, betting heavily on a grand and dense opera that evokes the gods.If Homer wrote The Iliad, Zack Snider created this version of Justice League\nThis movie will inevitably become a cultural landmark. At the same time proving that this long-length format works with the mass audience. Hopefully, opening the door to a new sandbox, to be explored by other filmmakers and streaming servicesIt is a landmark film, that values the creator artistic vision above all, and breaks with all the taboos of the genre of the last decade. An ultra-immersive experience that mesmerizes the viewer in a rich and living world.I give it almost nine out of ten stars.\nI recommend this movie to everyone who likes long films and trying new things.Zack Snyder, deserves all the praise.", "Fantastic!!": "What a fantastic movie! The 4 hours play time only felt like 2 hours.

There's a difference between marvel and DC, DC doesn't much rely on humor, the characters are god like powerhouses and does compliment the superhero tag attached to their names.\nZack snyder had perfectly captured the very essence of DC universe in it.\nI couldn't thank him enough for completing this project and presenting it to DC fans, although I shouldn't compare this to other movie franchise, but it was more epic than the end game, I wish warner bros would have release this version of justice league instead of the trash we've been served in 2017.\nFight choreography was amazing, ben Affleck was just perfect as batman, i hope to see him in future projects, all the star cast did justice to their respective character and were essential for the storyline, The new god darkseid was menacing and was well represented as a evil God trying to get hold of the world.\nI was watching it with a teary eyes, that's how much epic the movie actually is, it's a delight for DC fans and also for superhero movie buffs, who grew up watching DC animations.\nThere were few scenes, in which all the super characters were interacting with each other, which felt similar to the way they used to interact in the animated version of justice league, which is actually amazing.I hope warner bros complete the entire trilogy and let Zack snyder direct & complete his 3 movie arch.It was Splendid!", "Thoroughly enjoyed it": "Not a huge fan of any of the DC comics or characters but I do like a good superhero movie.

Spectacular success indeed.", "COMPLETE Satisfaction.": "Everything was on forking Point man,\nThe sound designThe color gradingeverything is connectedThe CGI is 80% good and 20% Bad.every Charterer that has contributed in the movie acted Great.", "A remarkable achievement for DCEU": "The problems of studio interference and the conflict of ideas between filmmakers and studio executives has been a major topic of discussion in the film industry. We've seen several movies ruined by problems such as this in the past few years. There is perhaps no better example for this than Justice League. Plagued by behind the scenes drama and a last-minute director change, Justice League came to theaters in 2017 as a sloppy, rushed and disappointing mess. However, after four years of waiting and as the result of a strong social media campaign, fans have finally got to witness the true version of the film and it was well worth the wait.Despite having an intimidating runtime of 4 hours, Zack Snyder's Justice League keeps you engrossed throughout, as it effectively utilizes the long runtime for character development and world-building, most of which was missing from the theatrical cut. The most noteworthy aspect was the development and backstory given for the character of Cyborg, which made him the true heart of the story. The same was done with the character of Flash, as he is given a much more prominent role in this version. Unlike the theatrical cut, the teamwork aspect was also presented extremely well as each member of the team, equally contributes to the story. The interactions between the main characters were also a treat to watch since they are much more fleshed out this time. Steppenwolf was given a reasonable motivation and a slightly sympathetic nature. Another remarkable aspect was the incredible CGI work which brought the character to life, giving him a threatening demeanor and detailed facial features and expressions. This was a tremendous improvement over the generic design and the one dimensional nature of the character in the theatrical cut. The inclusion of Darkseid was another stand-out aspect, as it keeps us hooked for future installments. Jared Leto redeems himself from his heavily criticized performance in Suicide Squad, as he delivers a short, but magnetic performance in this film.The action sequences were outstanding, eventhough it feels a bit overdone in a few instances. Another issue was regarding Lois Lane, who came across as a mcguffin for the story than an actual character. The frequent slow motion sequences, which is trademark of Snyder's visual style, is very effective for the most part. However it feels a bit unnecessary and out of place in a few instances.Even without the comparisons to the original, Zack Snyder's Justice League is still a solid film on it's own and is major step forward for the DCEU. It is incredibly delightful to see the victory of artists over businessmen, who frequently try to suppress the former. The success of this film is a remarkable achievement in the field of cinema since the film will act as a strong argument for creative freedom in filmmaking.", "Excellent but not what I'd want to view away from home": "The 4 hour runtime is daunting especially for an old gal like me. That being said, this movie gave me goosebumps of fan-appreciation throughout its entirety. Lots more character development except for Batman. I think the original Justice League kinda did that to death. This film is a departure from the usual boom and zoom one expects from Marvel Studios. A good contrast for me is that this edition of Justice League treats Cyborg and Flash more kindly, treats them like complex human beings and gives them the chance to shine. The 4-3 aspect ratio wasn't that bad once I got into it. This film made me feel like it was open-ended, more possible futures for our heroes. And me, being old school golden age comic book reader, that reveal at the very end was a blast.", "uh": "There was a time I would go to the cinema, watch a movie like Superman II or Raiders of the Lost Ark. I would think I really liked that movie, could had done with another 30 minutes added on to it, what a ride.", "One of the greatest superhero movies": "Justice League: The Snyder Cut was everything I'd hope it'd be but more! And I don't say that about many films. Chris Terrrio is an extremely underrated writer. I like what he did with Dawn of Justice and The Rise Of Skywalker, but this was his best film so far. The first Zach Snyder film where the screenplay was better than the directing. This was nice I didn't have to sit through 10 movies to get to the point and learn all about the characters. The studio ruined his script in the 2017 cut, which I wish could be erased from the DC world. Zach Snyder did give it his all, but I don't want to say this was his best directing out of all of his films. This is definitely Snyder's best film so far though. The film is best to watch through a projection or on Oculus VR, to get the authenticity of the format Zack Snyder wanted to present this film. If you watch this on your IPhone, Laptop, or even TV, you're not gonna get the experience you need to fully enjoy the film. This did not feel like a straight to digital release at all. Thank goodness we have projectors and VR headsets so we can experience these movies like we're in the theater, over watching them on a small screen on a phone. I enjoyed the Epilogues the most, since they're ideas from Zach Snyder and Chris Terrio that didn't make the 2017 cut. I thought Steppenwolf and Darkside were awesome villains. They're no Ultron or Thanos, but they're the best DC villains in recent years. The film had heart, loads of action, rich character development, fun storytelling, epic visuals, interesting dialogue, and amazing editing. Zach Snyder could have toned down on the slow motion, and the musical score is forgettable compared to previous entry's. I hope for a Justice League 2 because I'd love for this to be a trilogy, and for the story to do more with Darkside. I'd rate it a 10/10, and maybe because it succeeded my expectations, it's a way better film than the 2017 cut, and this gives hope for the DC movie universe to expand into a constructive narrative that hopefully gives us even more exciting movies with these characters.", "Blown away": "I can't believe this existed and WB released the Whedon Cut instead. Incredible. #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Who is Zack Snyder anyway???": "I'm not a basement dwelling comic book addict that spends 150% of my time learning twadle about these universes that don't exist....\nThat said... This was just so-so.. I liked the theater version much better... This iteration just seemed like a disjointed mess.. mismatched styles in both style and editing; I figure those that love it call it artistic.. I called it a headache..\nIt was worth it to see some of the CG altered sfx.. the villain certainly was a step up from the theatre version..\nAll in all though the movie simply reminded me of one of those of pampered kids whose parents praised every diddle they scribbled out.", "Overrated? yes! Long? All know well! Good? You bet it is": "Some are calling it boring, some say marginally better than theatrical version, some say very good and far beyond the level of previous one and some say best superhero movie ever. Well this movie is no comparison for infinity war or civil war but it is definitely better than most other superhero movies of the last decade.Story wise lots of scenes were from previous version which made a few parts of the first half somewhat boring. But then, previous one was absolutely boring. There is a lot of heart in this movie and sone of the most important scenes like Superman's resurrection or the final battle and the way the story ends is all done exceptionally well. I mean I heard what the story was going to end like because the original intended arc was what was later used in justice league dark apocalypse war. But still i got goosebumps at some of the scenes.Previous movie was all about resurrecting superman although his name was not mentioned till the idea was conceived by batman. But in this movie, they know from the first moment they need more muscle than they have. And yet in theatrical version, it seemed impossible for justice league to defeat Steppenwolf without superman while in this one, even without superman they have a plan, just turns out his help is needed as they thought they would. And superman actually gets a part more than the short fight scene with no breathtaking moment.\nAnd the scene where the idea of resurrecting superman is conceived, it is probably the best scene of DCEU, i mean it. Beautifully done. So is the actual resurrection scene.There is a lot of heart in cyborgs story and it is very well done although the concept is obviously a ctrl+c & ctrl+v of man of Steel. But his character is dealt with respect and his standalone scenes are beautifully done. Barry and flash both get more time and his character is drawn in somewhat details although it could be better.\nOverall, this felt like a justice league movie, while honestly speaking, previous movie felt like it was all about superman. Only flaw is that the story arc is open. And I hope zack snyder gets enough pressure from fans to make its sequels up until the Batman's injustice story dreams actually come to pass and that story actually completes. Also at least one movie is needed where there is no darkseid or alien supervillains, just lex and his team. Fingers crossed", "Best Comic Book Movie": "This movie is a masterpiece. It is long, but doesn't drag. It is a long film, so you could see character development from the newly introduced characters. Cyborg's story is very good, and unlike the theatrical cut everyone had to do their part in the end. The special effects were some of the best for the comic book genre. Acting was also very good and meaningful. Cinematography was beautiful and some of the best in a long time.I would like to see more of this story, and see Superman's story complete. I hope Warner Bros. Discovery finish this beautiful saga. It could compete with the likes of The Avengers: Infinity War and End Game. We really want to see the League take on Darkseid in the future.", "Zack Snyder's \"Justice League\" Movie Review": "Zack Snyder's \"Justice League\" was released on HBO MAX in 2021. It stars Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher as Cyborg, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf, and Ray Porter as Darkseid. This was the planned script for Justice League in 2017 which ended up getting scrapped and hiring Joss Whedon instead. This is a 4 hour long R rated Justice League film and every minute is better than Joss Whedon's version. This film is amazing and everything I would want out of a Justice League movie. The characters get tons of more development and backstory. Cyborg and The Flash are much better than they were in Joss Whedon's film. The plot is so much better explained and the overall story is a huge improvement. The CGI is so good it'll give you a heart attack. The film is amazing and breathtaking in so many ways.

The future of DC Comics has never been brighter.", "Best Superman vs Alien threat movie ever made": "This is by far my favorite Superman movie. I'm a huge Superman fan. I also love DC comics and movies. So yes, I'm a huge fan of Batman comics, and other things DC.This movie is 10 times better than the Joss Whedon theatrical release, which was awful in comparison. The main antagonist in the theatrical release was a pathetic general to the most masterful and menacing villain in the DC universe. There were many problems with that movie that I won't get into. In Zack Snyder's version we finally get a much better looking and powerful general, only to follow through with the demonic gods that bring a real threat to the world.This is the first and only movie where we finally see Superman have to take on someone that has been a challenge for him. Yes, it may be a bit long for some people, but I think it worked great with the chapters. I loved the protagonist in this movie, and really enjoyed the amazing details Zack Snyder put into this movie.I truly wish Zack Snyder was allowed to finish this story line. I would loved to have seen this continue into a series, with even a movie ending. But anyway, this remains to be the only movie that we finally get to see Superman face a real threat in the universe. I really hope we get to see a sequel in the future with him fighting someone else like Brainiac.", "Still Watching after 3 days.

Zach!", "Brand New": "I think that the most obvious thing to point out is that I sat through a four hour movie and it felt like only 1 hour. There is not a dull moment and it does not move too quickly. It is, in short, a masterfully created epic.Like many others, I watched and did not enjoy the Whedon Cut (Josstice League) so I was excited when I found out Snyder was taking on the task.It did not disappoint. The character development especially was great, giving us truly relatable characters that we can grow to like in a single film (albeit a long one).Well worth the hype. Definitely going to watch again.", "Buhaha": "What a load of tosh. Boring, plodding, and everything that has been done before. Literally the only scene in this 4-hour long directorial jerk-off that I really enjoyed was when the Flash was saving the girl from the car crash.", "Snyder completely rights the ship": "I've never been sold on the DCEU. I've watched all the movies but at best they were disappointing, and at worst complete disasters. I never could see Snyder's vision for these characters and universe but with this one movie I finally see it. WB execs must have been backseating hard until now, never letting him make the movie he wanted to make. Well he won me over, #RestoreTheSnyderVerse!", "Best super hero movie ever created!": "This is the best superhero movie ever created. I wish Iron man was in the movie as well. Loved it!", "Overhyped": "It's a good movie.Just overhyped.Snyder just added the random deleted scenes from previous JL movie. Some scenes are great like Flash scene. Overall Good movie", "4 hours, I still wish for more": "This is nothing like popcorn superheroes movies for a cheap laugh from the next door. This is what superhero movie fans really deserve!\nFrom now on, I will expect every masterpiece to be at least 3 hours long!\nBtw, I still don't understand why Superman fights his pals the first thing when he comes back. Why his pals weren't friendlier to see him. Weird. Still a great movie!", "OMG, so very good.": "Yes yes yes, this is brilliant. The only reason I did not give it a 10 star is because I was a little disappointed that there was nothing to bring the Lanterns into the next movie. I know there was a lot happening in this movie. And there is not time to showcase everything. But I think the Lanterns should be involved.", "The best version of Justice League.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than the theatrical cut. The extra runtime allows for more insight on the character. Cyborg is the biggest bennificiary of this, as he gets so much more character development in this version. Steppenwolf is more compelling, as his motivations are more clear. He want to redeem himself in the eyes of Darkseid. The extra runtime isn't all good though. I think they could've cut out quite a few unnessacary scenes, and the movie would've flowed better at 3:30. I also have some minor nitpicks, like the aspect ratio, no reason for Superman's black suit, and Martian Manhunter.Overall, it's still a big improvement over the theatrical cut, and it's now my 4th favorite DCEU film. 8/10.", "Zach is a hero!!": "I have been a huge superhero fan for over 40+ yrs. My whole family are fans. I'm so glad Zach's version of Justice League was released because it's 100% better than the theatrical. It is truly my opinion that in was in bad taste for another director to come in and make changes to an already fantastic film. Especially, because Zach had to leave for a very honorable reason. He needed to be able to grieve and be there for his family. This is why Zach is a hero! Thank you Zach for releasing your film. You deserve it!", "Hey CNET, how's that review going?": "After briefly reading seen it's harsh negative review of Zack Snyderis justice league, I was intrigued to watch the movie right away this morning. This is exactly what DC fans were asking for. The two hour 2017 theatrical cut was such a badly butchered down version just to fill in the allotted time. Even my son forgot about that version.This is what Zack Snyder wanted and intended. I am glad we got it. It is long, but much needed for all the characters. This one is for all true DC fans! Enjoy!", "Reality vs Hype": "So, this will sting for the cult of Synder, a bit of realism, the release in 2017 was not shot in the entirety by Joss Whedon, we need to understand this, at the point when he left the project principal photography was completed.So when the 'campaign' to release the Synder Cut, should have been that cut, albeit touch up work etc. So it was no surprising that the version rolled out, after another $70+ million spent on it was not as all the influencers on social media would lead you to believe a superhero masterclass by some mythical status director.When we got was characters with dry emotionless performances, arguably two of the most iconic superheroes in DC, if not the world, Batman and Superman treated with little respect to the 75+ years of lore behind their characters.The whole DCEU should, as the MCU is for Disney, been a hugely profitable franchise, yet somehow it stumbles badly, and that's painful, the possibilities were endless, but squandered.Should Synder direct, yes, should he write and design the DCEU, NO, he really does not under the emotions of the characters.", "Hamada must go out from WB": "Snyder gives us a true version of the heroes, the battles are epic and it is long because Wanner did not want to make individual films of the heroes like Marvel did. He now has to buy the blue rays so that the new director of Dc in WB Walter Hamada is fired with the silly ideas of him. Like an Afro Superman or Wonder woman", "What?! Incredible!": "Unlike the garbage that was released before this one, the Snyder cut actually gives you some context. I absolutely was blown away by this! 4 hours long and it felt like 2 hours. For anyone who thought differently might want to open their minds a little bit.", "Obviously better, but it's still bad": "Infinitely better cut but nothing can fix the actual problems here; and that's just that the DC is dumb. The characters powers and motivations don't make sense, the story is comically grand and the dialogue is contrite. Plus the overall feel is always blurry and dull with staged scenes that end up corny.\nIt's just never going to be Marvel because they just don't hve the patience or the talent or material to make a 'universe'", "Zack Snyder has made an incredible film, but he's an idiot.": "Absolutely outstanding, so much better than the originally released cut. Well done Zack Snyder.However, you're an idiot.Why release in an aspect ratio that isn't compatible with the overwhelming majority of viewing screens.Let's pretend for a minute that cinemas are open. Does every cinema have an IMAX? No, you idiot.Back to the real world. Does the film look awkward and misplaced on EVERY screen it has been watched on? Apart from the guy who has it streaming through a late 20th century CRT somehow, Yes!The film is outstanding and I hope you do sequel. However don't be such a moron and consider your audiences viewing platform.", "ZSJL has everything a cbm should have!": "First things first, the pacing is great. I know that will be the biggest complaint about ZSJL. Four hours flew by and not one minute dragged by. Could there have been fewer slow-mo shots? Maybe, but that's Snyder's style!The characters are fleshed out really well in my opinion. Wonder Woman and Aquaman do not get as much time or exploration into their arcs as the others and that is because Aquaman had a solo movie followed up by Justice League (2017) and WW had hers prior, so it's only right for Zack to focus on the other characters in flash, Batman, Superman, and of course cyborg! Not only are the protagonists explored appropriately, but the protagonists, especially steppenwolf, are finally portrayed as menacing as the New God should be. Because of that and his loyalty to Darkseid and Apokolips, this film has stakes, something Josstice League severely lacked.The action is top notch, the score by Junkie XL is phenomenal. The humor is appropriate and does not distract from the story and make you think twice. And the best part is that there is an emotional foothold, especially in our character Cyborg.My only complaints are some scenes' visual effects are a bit underwhelming and poorly done, but it did not bother me.As a comic book fan, this movie has everything I wanted. I truly hope this makes enough noise to warrant a sequel, because it was that good.", "It's fine": "First of all... I haven't seen the original Justice League movie, the Snyder Cut is my first experience.\nI liked it.\nThe story is nice, I didn't mind the length of the movie at all\nNow, the things I didn't like :\n1)Darkseid... So sad that he didn't get more screen time\n2) That damn song that plays every time Wonder Women is on screen, it was cool once or twice but they use it in 90% of the time she has a fight scene\n3)Flash...the actor that plays him doesn't resemble the comic book counterpart at all\n4) Maybe this is a misunderstanding from my part but.... How Darkseid forgot about the fact that the anti-life equation is on earth.... The masive symbol he carved into the earth when he was first introduced... He didn't realize that was the equation or what?", "Utter garbage": "4 hours of my life I won't get back. Felt to me like a load of cutscenes thrown together. Took too long to develop any characters. The only thing that made it bearable was ezra Miller as the flash.

How the Justice League should have been.\nConnected alot of things together that were missing.", "This is Legend": "The Best of all the DC VS Marvel Comics is here. The real War they fought and I've tuned for what's coming in 2023. I am Legend. This is Legend. Love It so much... Thanks Zack Snyder for your Release of the real Footage.", "A vast improvement! A unique experience of bonkers fan service!": "I hated the mishmash that was the 2017 Theatrical version of Justice League.The pacing, lame jokes, horrible color correction, bad villain and chopped up editing ruined the whole movie for me. An Avengers equivalent this was not!This new, re-edited, longer version?I loved almost every minute of it.While the basic structure of this film remains fairly unchanged, everything is fleshed out. All of the characters have motivations and reasons for their actions, even the bad guys. The editing is better. So are the effects. Snyder is also a much more artistic action director than Whedon, resulting in better action scenes. Steppenwolf looks way more metal (pun intended). The gore, swearing and R rating make every scene feel more realistic and earned. Even super heroes get pissed off at times and hearing \"gosh darn it\" wouldn't cut it here.The only thing I didn't find that great were some of the final parts of the Epilogue. That said, I do respect Snyder for putting those parts in for those who do find them rewarding.All in all, I am really happy we finally got a version of the live action Justice League worth watching. This is a good piece of pop culture entertainment, even though it's long. Thanks WB, Zack Snyder and the rest of the cast and crew. Thumbs up!", "Sloooooow, pathetic cringefest (with product placement!)": "Disclaimer: I watched the movie for about two hours (up until part four) and then gave up because this nonsense is simply not worth it. If I ever watch it to the end (doubt it) and it turns out that the final two hours are great and can somehow save this movie (highly doubt it) I'll change my rating.The most obvious thing first - this is too long; but it is not the duration of the movie itself that is bad. It is the fact that there is so much meaningless padding while at the same time the important parts are rushed, usually by exposition dumps that don't work at all. Somehow Snyder managed to get the worst of both worlds - the movie is at the same time too long and not fleshed out enough.Next - sloooooooow motion. It gets annoooooying reeeeeeeealy faaaaaaast. There is too much of it and it adds absolutely nothing in terms of quality.Writing - oh my God. If you ever want to show someone what \"cringe\" means, just let them watch any dialogue in this movie. The script looks like it was written by exceptionally annoying and untalented teenager who thinks themselves the coolest person in the world. While Marvel movies go for \"funny\" and end up being stupid, this one goes for \"dramatic\" but ends up being laughable.Acting - none of that here. You have Jason \"steroids commercial\" Momoa whose idea of acting is taking off his shirt. Then there is Gal Gadot. It's a complete mystery to me how she got the role. While I can understand that some people find Momoa attractive, Gadot is neither good looking, nor a good actor. Even the way she stands is unattractive and she only has two facial expressions: none, and constipated. Speaking of constipated, Ben Affleck also looks like he hasn't had a good trip to the bathroom in years. In general, all of the actors are trying too hard to look super cool. And trying to hard to act gives you the same result as trying too hard to fart.Characters - uninspiring and unattractive. The good guys are all geniuses who can do whatever the script calls for, and the bad guys, who are touted as extremely powerful and menacing, are completely underwhelming. No tension here, the result is never in question.CGI - inconsistent. Sometimes great, sometimes cartoonish and terrible. For instance, when you compare the Flash's slow motion sequence to the Quicksilver's one you can only feel sad for the Flash.Add to this an assortment of stupid small things (like Aquaman's trident - whose the name literally means THREE teeth, or prongs - which has FIVE spikes; Wonder Woman's civilian high heels which are completely impervious to jumping form great heights; the fact that Themyscira island seems to have higher population density than Singapore), in your face product placement and sprinkled fashionable nonsensical ideas (men stupid, women great) and there was really nothing enjoyable here.", "Much Better than the 'Abridged' Version": "Imagine seeing an abridged version of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy first (2 hours, with jokes), and a few years later seeing the entire series in full. Or a short 'Gone with the Wind' or 'Citizen Cane'. Completely different experience. Ok, this is obviously not in the same category of those classics. But, point being, if you liked (or even thought it was ok but could be better) the first Justice League, you'll love this version (and if you hated it, you probably won't like this version). Much more character development, much more plot, better effects, and significantly less fluff and comedy (its darker). Yes it's long - watch half, make an intermission, then watch the other half.", "Directors Cuts are Essential": "So much better!! I will continue this review.

Almost like watch video game. Just want to combine all hero's in previous movies all together. Not much logic. Poorly made.", "Longest mistake of my life": "Wayyyy too long. Some movies like lord of the rings, The godfather and heat make really long\nmovies work but this was awful. The story was generally terrible and most of it was just remaking the old one but if you ever want to torture someone, make them watch this movie. It will kill them.It was quite possibly the longest mistake of my life I will ever experience.", "This is such an improvement.": "This edition, compared to the theatrical edition is such a vast improvement, it makes me sad that this isn't canon in the DC universe. Warners seems to have deaf ears towards this project and what the fans want.Watch this over the theatrical cut!", "Finally some Justice !!": "Zack Snyder's JL is a visual spectacle that granted justice to all the characters, respected the fans and the comic book enthusiasts, but also delivered a well-constructed story to all the viewers who may or may not have a comic-book background. Considering that the director had a limited budget to complete the VFX in his unfinished scenes, the result was excellent (comparing it for example to the awful cgi of WW84 or the joke 2017 mustache version).Considering how much money WB executors decided to spent for the reshots and the butchering of the story back in 2017 just to provide us with a lame attempt to rip-off marvel tone, makes you think how these people keep their positions after that backfire. If there is one thing all movie makers and directors should have already learned after all these remakes and the forgettable sci-fi movies, is that no matter how much money you spend on cgi and special effects, if there is no good story, there is no solid movie.And Snyder invested in building a solid story and developing the new characters that were introduced so that people could understand their motives and backgrounds. I understand that many viewers are complaining about the 4hour length, but have in mind that this would not meant to be released on theaters. If that was the case, I'm sure the movie would have been trimmed of some redundant scenes (like the village song or Barry's second visit to his father in prison).\nHowever I can't imagine this working as a 2hour movie as the executors intended in the the first place - I would say a 3hour version of the movie would be ideal. Have in mind that Snyder did not have the luxury of having his new characters introduced in other movies (besides a small cameo in BvS).The only things I didn't like is that I had already seen the 2017 version so I was familiar with some scenes and this diminished the first time excitement (I really envied my wife who had no clue and enjoyed it so much) and the slightly altered tone of Batman from BvS. I preferred the fully rational and violent Batman of BvS but I have to admit that fighting aliens without any actual super-powers justifies his lighter and instinctive approach.Overall I think WB have a second chance of re-instantiating the DCEU, continue this wonderful story a bring more beloved characters to the big screen (like Darkseid, Martian Manhunter and the rest of Apokolips). It's a shame for their heroes to be wasted in silly plotless movies like WW84.\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Might be the best DCEU film": "I am not a big fan of the DCEU movies and Zack Snyder in general but this movie really gripped me from start to finish. The film being four hours long doesn't seem to lag much (expect for a few scenes) I don't want to compare it to the Justice League (2017) as that is an incredible low bar to clear. But DCEU as a whole was too boring to invest for me. They really tried to make it more fun and colourful with movies like Aquaman and Shazam which are really forgettable flicks. Zack Snyder's vision was of a Dark and gritty universe and I'm glad that he got the opportunity to present it to his fans. I prefer this version over whatever they tried to create in 2017. Was this a perfect film? Not at all. Some of the music score felt so irritating and overused. The CGI was not perfect and there are certain characters that look awful. I'm also not a fan of the aspect ratio. But Overall the film entertained me and got me invested in the mythology that Snyder crafted.", "This was the right format for this story": "Just let Zack Snyder tell his story the way he wants to and it will be amazing. I loved this format too. It gave the story the extra time it needed to breath properly. Love the slow build. It is long, but I watched it in 3 sittings like a tv show. It was perfect. True justice. Thank you for doing this!", "A story that's worth it's namesake: Justice League.": "A true sequel to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and with awesome brutal action scenes , the sense of intense stakes and threat that require these heroes , and the emotional turmoil within them, make this an incredibly well made, astounding and heart-touching movie. Extremely worth it. Very satisfied. Thank you and congratulations Zack Snyder.", "Justice for the justice league": "I was waiting for this movie for so long and all that wait was worth it. This movie felt that was made with heart and love to our favorite characters. Visually it looks beautiful, also the music is amazing, this is the movie that we deserved in 2017.", "Definetly impressive": "It turned more than my expectetions, honestly when I heard about this movie released I was thinking it will be second diseaster of Justice League, because first one was funny but not impressive, matters were pasting fastly without explain the details, hovewer details make a production good or bad.DC made mistakes with pointless Superman and Batman fights, just for more money, it decreased power of the chracters nature. I liked to see Superman with his own nature, as the most powerful fictional chracter, I hope the effect of this movie can be a good lesson to DC, so they don't show us garbages again, they should show superman's true power as more as they can, not only someone jumping around and fly in the colorful suit.", "A lot better than the previous one.": "I actually cared about Cyborg in this movie. I would love to see a solo movie with him in the future.", "I am not a Snyder fan but...": "First let me just say if you want to dislike this film then that's fine, the world would be boring if everyone had the same opinion. This is mine:Art is different for everyone. Some people do camera angles, others do slow motion. Zack Snyder does the latter and it is not for everyone. But is for some. This is a different movie to the 2017. Same story, same actors, bigger film. And it was beautiful. I highly loved this movie. It was full of story, the heroes were all amazing and every single one played a big part. I found the film was done well with it's 6 parts too. It was like reading a book, very well done. The 2017 movie was ok. Honestly it wasnt atrocious. Yet i can honestly say will never see it ever again now. This movie is a masterpiece. There i said it. I was not a Snyder fan, but i am now. Thank you sir! I enjoyed your art", "Epic, fantastic and well done excitement.": "#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague was a massive improvement over the 2017 version and in my opinion, the better version of this movie. Even though I don't hate the Whedon Cut of the film and that is a guilty pleasure, this version is more superior and is more in line of what Snyder set up in Man of Steel and BVS and it respects what came after those (minus Suicide Squad).Steppenwolf is a lot better here as a villain that he was in the Whedon cut and he has more development and motivation for his plan. Cyborg and Superman are the heart and soul in the entire movie, played amazingly well by Ray Fisher and Henry Cavill. Superman's arc of him transitioning into the Superman we know and love is much more emotional and felt more natural than it does in the theatrical edition. The other characters such as Ben Affleck's Batman/Bruce Wayne, while badass, does have an arc in terms of feeling guilt for what happened in theend of BvS. Ezra Miller is still great as The Flash, but he isn't as obnoxious as he was in the Whedon cut. I actually loved his development in this movie. Gal Gadot is still a badass as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman and her character development is even more better. The fact that WB removed extra footage from the original theatrical version and deemed this \"unwatchable\" is beyond me.It does have a few issues in terms of the epilogue going for a bit too long, the Atlantis stuff wasn't as interesting, the aspect ratio didn't grab me instantly but it grew on me (i know it's IMAX aspect ratio but it took some time to get used to) and there is some iffy CGI but this is a much better version that allows us time to care about these heroes, the story, the situation and the villain. Hopefully, we get to see what Snyder had in mind next if he gets to do them.Also, the surprises and cameos we're so much fun to see and the score by Junkie XL is freaking awesome as well as the action sequences.Definitely watch this on HBO Max and can't wait for the Blu-Ray/DVD release. Also, if the Snyderverse is restored, please make sure to still do solo films in this DCEU, WB and DC.#ForAutumn.", "REMOVE 2017's edition! Zack Snyder's details WOW'!": "Masterpiece!! Nothing more\nZack Snyder's edition is the real JUSTICE LEAGUE thank u for this", "Made a bad film into a great one": "So disappointed in the 2017 version. This one was how it was supposed to be. So much more added so much more character development. Didn't feel like 4 hours. By the end I wanted to keep watching more. I hope Snyder keeps making more. Left us hanging and would be a shame if the story didn't continue. Wasn't perfect but was overall satisfied.", "Does Lipstick on the Pig work?": "Positives:\nWell - it's so much better than the original 2017 version of \"Justice League\", but then that's not saying much! (I realise that I never did a review for that movie, which I saw on a transatlantic flight - - I put the whole incoherent mess down to my jetlag. But no.... it really was an incoherent mess!).In the Snyder cut, we gain a much broader introduction to all of the main characters, especially to Barry Allen (the Flash) - in a very entertaining pet shop interview scene - and Victor Stone (Cyborg). And Steppenwolf gets more air time to flesh out his character.The story I find very similar to the Marvel equivalent: with Darkseid = Thanos; boxes = stones; Avengers = Justice League! But the story is at least now coherent and flows well. Its action set pieces, especially the ultimate defeat of Steppenwolf (nice decap!), are exciting.Some of the distracting scenes (the trapped family in the Russian ruins is a key example) have been excised from this version, making for a significant improvement.Negatives:\nI'm with Mark Kermode in being a little bit mystified by all of the rave 5* reviews for this one. By anyone's imagination, a run time of 242 minutes is over-indulgent.Although the epilogue scene, featuring Jared Leto's Joker and a Batman f-bomb, is entertaining, it actually adds nothing to the exposition and could have been dropped to reduce the bladder-testing run time.That 4:3 screen ratio! JUST WHY SNYDER, WHY? There's one scene in particular, where all six members of the Justice League line up in the sunset to dramatic swelling music. The screen ratio forces Snyder to film it at a 60 degree angle to get them all in! \"Galaxy Quest\" intelligently used three different screen ratios, to great visual effect. So I could perhaps understand it if the 'flashback' scenes had been 4:3 and the rest in 16:9. But as it is, the usage is gimmicky, making (imho) no sense for a big fantasy spectacle like this.The Junkie XL (as Thomas Holkenborg) soundtrack I'm afraid did nothing for me.Summary thoughts:\nIt's a film, for sure. Is it a watchable film now... hmm, yes just about. And it has scenes which indeed are highly entertaining. But if you follow my One Mann's Movies blog you should know by now my view on movies that extend beyond 90 minutes... they need to justify that delta running time. And by outstaying this target by another 90 minutes... and then by ANOTHER 62 minutes borders on taking the **proverbial**. It's not Shakespeare!(For the full graphical review, check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks).", "The best movie of 2021 by far": "This is one of the most greatest if not best superhero movie ever and we can now thank warner and Zack for this masterpiece. This movie was so good I cannot wait to see the next one. This makes modern MCU look weaker I think we now have competition. No overdose of \"the message\" and Wonder Woman shines in this film and any other character even the bad ones.Tiny inconsistently stuff but it doesn't effect the plot.Better than no way home.", "The real Justice League": "It's really incredible. Creepy, exciting and even inspiring. Characters with their well-polished and fluid developments that let the narrative go on without getting a single boring or monotonous time. Everything is interesting. It manages to be grand and epic indeed. I really liked it", "It's a very very good movie but....": "That's it really. It is infinitely better than the original abomination that was spat out which in fairness wasn't very hard as that was one of the worst movies I have ever saw.The aspect ratio it was shot in did not both bother me in the slightest and I thought the soundtrack was fantastic. The action sequences especially, at the end, were absolutely amazing but you still have to marry that to the earlier Wonder Woman scene in the bank which looked clunky and odd. A few other scenes which I won't get into also needed seriously brushed up on as well.The story line and pacing even at 4 hours long was very good and the arcs for each character were much improved. That being said the fact aquaman seems reduced to saying \"alrrright\" or \"wooooo\" half of the time and his power seems to be the ability to get his ass handed to him repeatedly was a little disappointing.This may be controversial but I'm sorry even in this movie Ezra Miller is awful as the flash and his \"comedy\" seems forced and most of the time completely out of touch with the tone of the movie. I still find him to be an extremely unlikeable character.I also found it odd that Batman made a promise to superman to protect the world but he didn't take the time to make sure Clark's mum had a house to live in. Yes this is rectified at the end but it's still a strange occurrence.It is definitely worth a watch and I would recommend it but as I am neither a fanboy of either marvel or DC I can honestly say it was not the masterpiece many are claiming. As someone who is a huge fan of Sin City, 300 and the older Michael Bay movies I love the slow mo they use but it is wayyyyyyy overused here to the point where it's in almost every single scene.The scene with joker and Batman is fantastic and I would love to see more of that chemistry. I've always said I think Leto should have got a better run as joker and those who constantly slated his appearance must have been unaware that this was the arc where he had killed Robin to finally have Batman kill him and break his golden rule. Batman beats him so bad he knocks his teeth out hence the grills we see.Would love to see a sequel but maybe people will reconsider their ridiculously over the top reviews after the excitement has passed a little.", "Despite its shortcomings, it's still Epic": "Yes, the colossal feature film so many love to hate on, even me - before I watched it. Yes, the wife and I took 4 or 5 nights to plow through the nearly 4 hrs run time so we treated it more like the mini-series it was going to be. Z-Snyder resurfaces some of his special sauce from 2007's \"300\" in this epic tale that features Amazonians that are oh so similar to his \"300\", even with associated ancient Greek choir. So, many of us have enjoyed that. Superman looks more like a gay-icon in this treatment, too, so a little \"love\" thrown their way. Amy Adams has chunked out, so no more celebrity-crush for her. Jesse Eisenberg turns in the best performance as villainous Lex Luthor. And Ben Affleck was a decent, brooding Batman whose Bat-weaponry makes up for his lack of super-abilities. Yes, there are plot holes and events that get short shrift but overall, it's still an epic tale. But no, it's just not as good as the Marvel films, it's just not, but here's hoping...", "Lost for words": "The original justice league is a completely different movie. Whedon completely trashed it.

I'm glad to see this universe come to an end. Hopefully in a few years, some capable filmmakers and actors will be able to bring it the justice it deserves. Fans like this universe because it brings their favourite heroes to the big screen rather than the films being competent.For those of you who disliked Justice League's mediocrity and are wondering whether this film is an improvement, it isn't. It's just more of the same.

The actors amazing!", "Just as unwatchable as the original...but longer.": "You have to really be a diehard (insert your favorite DC character here) fan to even fathom rating this above a 3. It literally drains the life of you. So much wasted time waiting for characters to act, so many drawn out scenes yanking and pulling at any heartstring it can latch on to in an effort for you to give any regards to any of these characters. The writing is awful, dialogue is stiff and the humor is forced and not funny. The bad guys are bad because we are told they are bad, not because of any actions they take or goal they aspire too. Why does everyone have father issues (except Wonder Woman who by not having a father is it's own issue) Cyborg is played so serious and stiff and without any personality and you don't care about him and his dead parents at all.But then you have to blame the poor source material this movie draws from. DC heroes never evolve or change, each character is unrelatable, even the Flash, who is supposed to be the most relatable of them all. This is why they have to reboot these characters every 2-3 movies, and they always promise a new spin and that spin is grounded in the anchor of the original backstory's you all of them. Free these characters from there 30's, 40's and 50's origins and rebuild the character from the ground up and you may; have something close to watchable.Snyder didn't bring anything new to the cut except extra length and unwatchable backstory building which does nothing but slow any momentum to a crawl. Over rated and overhyped. 8.1 on IMDB? Sounds like the fanboys took over and are trying to save the characters they have to keep defending with every one of these movies that come out.", "Could be better": "I can say that it has only made the previous version more popular.

Honestly I was hesitant to sit through a 4 hour film but this is exactly what this movie should have been the first time around.The story is deeper and gives the characters the justice they deserve from the terrible movie we were forced to endure in 2017.Snyder's vision is truly incredible and after so much that has happened I'm so happy he has this win and that we all get to enjoy it! I highly recommend watching this. It's long so even if you only make it through once you'll have at least had the opportunity to see how absolutely stunning it is.", "One word......

Synder Cut is much more coherent and deeper than the 2017 version. We get to see a lot of backstory which gives a lot of meanin to the faceoff between the JL and steppenwolf.The core of the movie remains the same. But the additional scenes gives a lot of meaning to the main characters.Subtle humour, improved CGI and well choreographed action sequences were fun to watch. Steppenwolfs nd Cyborgs story arcs were the highlight. 4hrs was not much big of an issue. But editing all these contents to a 2 nd half format for a theatrical release seems like an unthinkable job.But i found the movie way too ambitious. it is brimmed to the top with various storylines. Being a DC fan from my childhood, i was able to understand most of the references thrown to us all across the movie. It has almost two or three movie's content which is being wasted without building the proper foundation for it. The final 10 mins shows us the Injustice world. i find it way too premature to be giving away such strong DC plotlines,.All the characters need more screen time to make all the audience feel connected with them. Injustice is DC one of the most interesting plots of all time. Without giving a solid base for all the characters and bruce and clarks camaraderie , the whole highlights of the intersting and complex comic might fall bland just like death of superman arc. After all, Slow and steady wins the race.", "Cannot believe...": "I cannot believe how he made the 2017 version look soo good now! We were least thrilled to watch for this release, but then it took us by surprise when we saw what we saw. Important thing is, in this version, Zack snyder has made sure all those bad portions from the previous are taken out. That really made the movie look a lot lot lot better. I rated the 2017 version 5 and this one 9. That explains how much better this one is.", "Great experience!": "Amazing Zach, I loved it, first 4 hour movie I've ever seen. Love what you made of the Flash and Cyborg. Darkseid looks awesome.Overall great movie but one small thing, I hate those cheesy lines, I mean for example wonder woman saying to that girl, you can be anything you want, ughhh, funnily enough that scene was actually brilliant, Gal Gadot really owns wander woman. Just give her stronger lines. I mean she could have said you are wonderful the way you are. That would have been much better.", "What a mess.": "A lot happens in four hours.

So much of it is so contrived. And just plain silly...despite good actors trying their best. The square format does however do wonders for the look and feel of the movie...said no one ever. WTF? This movie was really bad the first time and this one just adds two more hours of bad. If you have to tell a story in four hours I think that's a sure sign that maybe the story isn't a good one.", "Best superheroes ever": "Man I can't imagine how good this movie is, i mean the action was masterpiece and all the aspects of the movie is masterpiece", "The greatest superhero movie yet": "I've watched nearly all of the Marvel movies and they are ok. Dumb, simple fun with plenty of action scenes. This one however was more a true spectacle. Action scenes were not too long and too repetitive to become boring and annoying. The style and the pathos Snyder was trying to achieve perhaps went too far at times, for example when people started singing for the Aquaman. Altogether those slow moments however worked and the movie didn't feel like a hasted cartoon. This movie did many things right not to make you lose your concentration despite the 4 hour length. Could it have been shorter though? Absolutely. 30 minutes could have been cut.", "4 hr of epic tale looks very short": "Omg.. Its is masterpiece.. Snyder cut took justice league to next level.

Yet it was still not the best. Most of the film (all 4 hours) where quite boring. The editing in this film is very distracting, and the film often cuts at random points.

Remember that this is uncut version.": "I read many reviews before starting to write this one.Some are confused about the epilogue. Some think that there is an overuse of CGI. Some wish that the entire film could have been shorter.But I don't get why these people don't understand that it is a director's cut which means there will obviously be a lot of unwanted scenes and if the film had been released in theatre, most of them would have been cut out.To me honestly, I love the way that the film has been made. I love the action CGI sequences, I love the in-depth story lines of these characters, I love how the film tries to stick so hard with the logistics.With DC's sucked up film prequels and their messy story lines, the film doesn't make much sense in general. There is nothing at stake for our heroes other that the world, which doesn't seem to care about anything. All the major characters, except superman, had nothing to lose and this film should have been made after flash/cyborg films (if they could be accommodated).The storyline was a mess. I only admire the effort that's been put into this film and the collective spirit of fans who wanted this cut haven't been disappointed. That's all it matters, I think. It might be 4 hours long, but didn't feel like it. The cinematography and the shots were really immersive and 4:3 ratio was not that annoying.To conclude, I loved the filmmaking more rather than the film.", "AT&T Make them give us more": "All of this happened because of fan demand and AT&T pushing WB to make it happen.

If there are superheroes in it, I watch it. I'm always super excited for the next Marvel movie, but I've never been excited for the next DC movie. Until now.I was, to put it mildly, really skeptical about this movie. I didn't like the original at all - I was so disappointed when it ended. I felt like there was so much potential and like there was something missing. Actually, all previous DC movies made me feel like there was something missing. I couldn't feel the characters or be invested in the universe. They were great as entertainment. But that was it. I would forget them again. I don't think I've ever watched a DC movie more than once (besides The Dark Knight trilogy and JOKER).But this? When the movie ended I FINALLY had the feeling of being excited! Thank you! The last part really drew me in and now I can't wait to see the next one!

This version was sooo full of filler we couldn't get past the first two hours. I don't understand these 10/10 reviews unless they were paid for, are from people who pushed for the Snyder cut and felt vindicated, or simply have no taste. Felt similar with Endgame which was bloated garbage.

It had so much potential but just missed all the beats. And when I kept hearing about the Synder cut, I made sure to have no expectations. Man Of Steel was awesome. Batman V Superman was very average in that overall it was entertaining to me, but should have been awesome featuring Batman and Superman in the same movie instead of being a less exciting version of Captain America Civil War which came out the same year and followed a similar conflict. So I decided it won't hurt to give this Synder cut a try, and boy was I glad I did.This movie gives a full origin story to Cyborg. It introduces and builds Aqua Man and Flash in this movie way more than the theatrical cut even did. The pacing just felt more relaxed here and deserving instead of the rush back to back scenes from the original.My only complaint would be the epilogue. I don't like how it was building up for a sequel. I wish it just wrapped itself up as a standalone movie. If we do get a sequel which delves into the dream sequences, then it will have paid off from the build up since Batman V Superman. If we don't get a sequel, then the dream sequences are just teasing that doesn't deliver.All in all, solid movie.", "Us United": "This movie was a blast filled of excitement and emotion. Amazing introductions to the new members and a lot of highlight moments for each one. Best action sequences I ever seen in a movie alongside an incredible score. Also well crafted orgin stories for this universe and a menacing villain with clear motivation and goals.At the beginning of the movie we see a tormented Bruce trying to atone for failing Superman by gathering the league to save the world. Bruce seeing Superman as the hope to win the fight shows how far he came from the beginning of BvS. This also brings Superman's story full cyrcle \"But in time, they will join you in sun\".Cyborg the heart of the movie as Zack said but also was the mind of the Justice League because of his new powers and their connections. The movie visuals for the superpowers are done incredibly well and Cyborg gets a brilliant scene explaining his powers. Ray Fisher delivers a great performance while we explore his struggles and relationship with his father.The other new member that had alot more foucs in this cut is The Flash, In addition to having a full mini arc his fun personality is nice inclusion. The chemistry with Cyborg is great and I wanted more of it. Just like Cyborg he gets his own great scene toward the end of the movie. Arthur learning to trust in others and also taking his first Atlantian responsibility is good set up for his movie.I can't stress how much of a badass Wonder Woman is in this movie. Zack introduced his female superhero in the second movie and she got her own movie after it. The Amazons scenes rock. This shows how much of woman power is represented in this movie and cinematic universe in general without the need to force anything in.There's alot of fan service in this movie but it's good since this movie especially is for the fans and Zack even went on to shoot an extra scene because this supposed to be his last DCEU movie but I have hope that we will see more and Justice League part two.My only complaint is that some the songs don't always fit the scene they are in.Finally \"Us United\" is not just a marketing phrase or the theme its how this movie came to be, how the fan banded together for 4 long years until their efforts became reality and Zack got his vision finally realised after the tragedy that befallen his family. Even after the movie came out, I'm genuinely surprised by how many people are enjoying and praising this movie not only Zack's fans but even skeptis.#ThankYouZackSnyder", "Magic Carpet Ride": "In my review of the theatrical cut of \"Justice League\", before the Snyder cut was announced, I said \"I appreciate that people would like to see what Snyder's true vision for the film was, however, I can't believe that there's some magic way to reedit this film and make it passable. The \"bones\" of a good film just aren't there for that to happen.\" I was wrong. With some more reshoots and reutilising the footage that was cut it was possible to make film that's good. Good, but not great.The death of Superman (Henry Cavill) activates three ancient motherboxes stored on Earth. Now the planet is unprotected, Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), desperate to ingratiate himself back into the good graces of Darkseid (Ray Porter) comes to the planet to unite the boxes and cleanse the planet in his master's name. But Earth is not unprotected. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) puts together a team including, Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher).It is a lot better than the theatrical cut. Four hours will allow you to go much deeper on the characters that two hours do and The Flash and Cyborg are the ones who benefit most from this. The Flash has a new action scene, which introduces us to Iris West, played by Kiersey Clemons. Cyborg though is recut to essentially being the centre of the movie. His relationship with his father, and with the Motherboxes becoming even more central to the narrative throughflow of the film. Rejigs in the dialogue make Steppenwolf's goals clearer and we see both Darkseid and DeSaad in a wormhole to (presumably) Apokolips.But, four hours also comes without the need to be judicious in the editing as you might want to be. There a lots of slow-motion shots, repetition of scenes and new scenes that, though sometimes lovely moments, often pose more questions than they answer. Hey Jon Jonze, any reason you didn't want to help in this epic battle for the planet? The scene from the \"Knightfall/Injustice\" future is all very cool, but as it stands we're never getting that film. Similarly, the Lex Luthor/Deathstroke additions aren't going anywhere either. I could have done without the washed out look and the score and musical choices aren't great (which is unusual for Zack Snyder).Like I say though, it's much better than the Theatrical version and it's a solid experience, but I think, with a bit of perspective, some of the gloss is going to come off.", "Complete different movie from the original.": "I was worried about 4 hours long movie would include too much details and adding unnecessary emotional scenes to make the movie boring. Turn out that it was necessary to include those parts or the movie just does not make sense. The action scenes of this version is a lot more intense and the ending is so much better than the original. Including DarkSeid scenes and explaining the history of the defenders make the movie so much more attractive. The best scene in the original movie is probably the part with Superman being incoherent but in this version, that part is actually the worst but it is still not bad to watch. That is how much better this version is. I probably still would not recommend to watch four hours in one sitting. I would not mind to pay twice the money to watch this movie in two parts (well the movie is told in several different parts anyway). I give 9 stars for the details stories for Flash, Cyborg and DarkSeid. It is interesting to see Steppenwolf and final fights changes as well.", "Justice for the DC fans": "The best DCEU movie to date even surpasses man of steel.", "Finally, a fitting response to Marvel's Avengers": "Firstly, we've got to acknowledge that this version is really long, & given how trendy Limited series are these days, no complains whatsoever! Secondly, every glaring pothole from the 2017 version is fixed, the character arcs are treated so very well especially that of Cyborg, the Flash and even Superman. Its a real shame, that Warner Bros. Want yo shelve out Hemry Cavills version of Superman ( Bad decision alert). The movies pushes in tje right direction, really great action, call backs to Zack's 300 action sequences, especially the Amazonian fight sequence. A bit too many Slo-mo sequences than what you' like, but overall, a great, great iteration of what Justice League should be.

I loved that the cheesiness was toned down and that the Flash had to complete a marvel feat to save the day (instead of just moving a truck load of kids in the original.\nThis movie was much more meaningful - I'd binge it in Gold Class theatre if it were there.\nFour hours was insanely long - worth it.", "Refreshing, exciting, and satisfying.": "Although not perfect, Zack Snyder's Justice League reaches epic proportions and delivers what it promised (and some.) It was wonderful to finally experience a worthy next entry in the SnyderVerse. I didn't think it was perfect and I wish some things were done differently, specifically some of the CGI and soundtrack. However, it won me over in the end with some top-notch action sequences and a great fan-servicing script. Anyone who considers themselves to be a DC fan or a superhero fan in general should make this one a must-watch.", "So much better than the original": "I know a lot has been written about this immense film already so I will be brief.Yes, it was so much better than the original due to one reason; it filled in all the plot holes left from the original movie. For example, CYBORG, we got to see his basic origin story which was great.Absolutely, loved Superman in the black suit and cape with the neon blue emblem of \"hope\" on his chest.Snyder just fleshed out everything that could be said about this Justice League and I can't wait for the DVD or Blu-Ray release.It's the longest running superhero movie ever made at over four hours long and lapped up every screen image of these stunning characters. I think Snyder has given DC fans something that won't be soon forgotten.If you haven't seen it - SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Interesting to see but....": "Yes, it is interesting to see how Snyder saw the Film, and there is more/better character development, and a massive amount of new stuff, but I can't believe it's getting such good o/a reviews and some 10/10 - really? Overall think Snyder has overindulged, desperately slow and poor fx, and washed out look - there is a reason that truly good Film-makers understand less is more and understand pacing. Certainly no worse than the Theatrical version, but is it that much better? Marginally maybe. A pared down Snyder version with (much) better pacing would have been better. I'll stick to Marvel! And no I'm not pro Marvel/anti DC - I collect both in Graphic novels with equal fervour....", "A solid DCEU entry that warrants its 4-hour run-time! [+69%]": "A vast improvement over the 2017 theatrical version, the Snyder Cut (something I really didn't believe could be put together after all these years of speculation) is actually a solid 4-hour long film. The tone is definitely darker, the colour palette harmonious with Snyderverse, and every frame (be it digitally enhanced or otherwise) oozes that Snyder spark. This is a film that Snyder completely owns, and he does a pretty neat job at it. Firstly, the protagonists are fleshed out better. When Snyder remarked that Cyborg was supposed to be the heart of the film, he really meant it. The Snyder Cut gives Victor Stone (Ray Fisher) all the time and screenspace he deserves and turns him into a character whose emotional payoffs matter. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) isn't the scaredy-cat who constantly needs mentoring from Bruce Wayne - he's a smarter, more natural presence within the group - getting more than just a few moments to shine. I loved Miller and Fisher in the film and I'm glad I got to see these versions of their characters. Darkseid's scenes prove to be futuristic teasers, while Steppenwolf makes for a more well-rounded antagonist this time.Affleck, Gadot, Momoa, and Cavill too get scenes of their own to shine. The soundtrack by Junkie XL is kickass once again; I feel like the score elevated almost every set-piece (that ancient Amazonian warcry + Wonder Woman theme combo is pure eargasm!). Yeah, it might feel like a long film (because it is!) and it's structured in the chapter format (which works better for a mini web-series) though the run-time, for once, feels fully warranted. The epilogue, which features some surprises, nicely sets up a sequel. Justice League was never Joss Whedon's film. Snyder, for all the hate he received for BvS, redeems himself to a fair extent and finally gets his due (personally and professionally!).", "This movie is for the fanboys ...": "For normal movie goers ... like myself ... this film is a 4-hour long melodramatic, meandering, syrupy, arduous slog of a film... that could've been an hour shorter if Snyder would just ease up on the slow motion effects... YIKES.Snyder tries to make up for the fact that he's missing 3 films to fill in backstories for his primary heroes. So he tried to cram 4 movies into one AND set up a sequel. It's no wonder the primary plot of the film gets completely lost amidst all of the flashbacks to the point where an hour in ... I couldn't tell what was going on and was bored out of my mind.Was it tonally more consistent than the previous JL? Yes... but I don't know that it was a good thing. Everything in this film is SO HEAVY. The music has to punch EVERY dramatic scene up to an 11 which makes everything feel schlocky and syrupy instead of carrying actual weight.And the end result of the film is the same: you don't need a Justice League if you have a Superman. It was REALLY obvious in the previous film and it's still obvious in this one too ... which means that this movie is essentially pointless ... twice.Plus Steppanwolf still looks like crap and isn't scary at all... so why'd Snyder bother changing him?In short: don't believe the hype if you're a normal person ... it's 4 hours of your life you won't get back.", "eh...": "The movie was long and boring and the soundtrack sucked.", "Its a shame that this did not made it to theaters": "What a MOVIE!\nFrom the scale, to the character building, to being connected with BVS and to Zack's vision everything is mesmerizing.\nFeeling so satisfied after watching this, but also tempted to see where we will go from here. #restorethesnyderverse", "This is SO much better than the 2017 rubbish they released": "This is WAYYY better than the Whedon theatrical cut. Obviously, it's a much longer film... But that is actually not a bad thing. Way more character development. The original 2017 version I have not purchased.. and not sure I ever will. The Snyder version, I will. \ud83d\udc4d This makes me wonder what other director's cut are out there sitting in a box somewhere. Well done Zack.", "Lamentation ancient music...lol!": "These reviews, both users as well as \"critics\" are honestly proving me there's a lot of buying in this industry... I mean the fact that he added 2.5 hours filled with just back stories does not mean necessarily the movie all of a sudden is better... ask yourself, should Zack finished the first one was that going to be 4hours long? Now I like Zack Snyder, but there's nothing here that justifies this 8.4 review - this is exactly the same movie with the same flaws as the original, only longer. The story is weak, the action scenes are weak, actually nothing really new here, and the score so out of sync - all the time the amazon's team came in just broke the rhythm of the whole sequence - bad editing... When I look at this movie, the only good add is the higher presence of darkseid...\nI don't think DC has what it takes to become DCU... my opinion.", "One for the ages": "I love this version so much that this should be at the very top of greatest superhero movies of all time. DC superheroes have redeemed themselves on this one, with this singular vision from Snyder, here's hoping that more films to follow continuing his vision for the DC universe.", "Great direction. New perspective of superhero movies": "I never expected this lengthy cut to be so good. I realized superhero movies can be directed as good as drama movies if they are not rushing with two second edits. Snyder did a great job. Great writing. The movie is not the best but close to Nolan's DC movies. This is what we need. I don't mind seeing a 4 hour movie if it is made this way. Sad that the theatrical version was damaged so very much because of wrong guidance. I wonder how big names just overlooked such a good product being thwarted earlier. The power of one man's vision, if left to his decision, makes huge difference. This is DC's time!", "Henry C....i luv \u2764": "A thrilling action film starring not only my favorite DCU characters but also Henry Caville as Superman . James Cameron, Aliens taught me that a great film needs to have multiple scenes depicting challenges which need solving while getting to the climax. JL 2021 achieved this action. Heres hoping that this film can become cannon and we get a part 2. Oh...dead the Lois Lane actress. \ud83d\udc4e a good fit.", "Snyder gives the fans justice!": "Amazing! When I heard that this was going to one big film instead of parts, I wasn't sure if it could keep my attention. But as I started watching it just seem like no time before it was over and leaving me wanting more.", "RIP Josstice League!": "This is the best Superhero Team up movie I have ever seen! The Fun, The, Emotion, The Story, The Characters and the Action is everything you can hope for! Why Warner Bros sidelined and butchered this original version in 2017, baffles me to this day! I can't wait for the sequel!", "Same main plot but this are amazing": "Even wit the same main plot, this Snyder's cut telling you a whole new perspective and bunch of details you cannot seen in 2017 Justice League. The fighting scene are are much better, the ending also makes me wanting more of Snyder's version Justice League Sequel...\nCome to papa Darkseid.... we waiting for you here on earth...", "Justice served": "I'll keep it short, yes it's a long long movie but well worth it and yes JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED.", "This is a movie for the fans.": "This is a movie for the fans of the DC universe, not the casual viewer. If you're a DC nerd you're going to sit there for the full four hours and enjoy every second. If you're casualy invested in the superhero genre you might find this too long and boring. I am so glad we got to see the version Snyder visioned when he started making this movie because it sure is great.", "Restore the Snyderverse": "Restore the Snyderverse.ASAP.\nThat's it.\nThat's my review.", "Didn't expect it to be this good.": "After watching the theatrical release at the cinema, the first thing I said to my friend as the credits rolled was \"Gee, is that it!?\"\nI honestly couldn't believe how short it was, super hero team-ups are supposed to be epic, and it was just so vague and unfulfilled.Enter the Snyder Cut. The first hour and seven minutes covers the first two 'parts' of this release, and it's at this point you realise just how good Snyder is, it's well paced, it draws you in, the protagonists are getting character development, and most importantly the bad guys are actually written into the script - that's right, there is actual meaning and a reveal of the baddies!I won't say much more but Darkseid has a scene and it's awesome.Do yourself a favour, forget you ever watched the first release, and sit back and enjoy the film the way it was intended.Best DC movie ever. Thank you Mr Snyder.", "BORING!!": "It was the same boring stuff that we got in the original release but for 4 hours instead of 2. Even *that* was painful to watch! The only decent DC movie that I've seen is #WonderWomanThe CGI is bad, the picture quality is bad, the story is extremely slow-paced, the villains suck and all of the characters are boring af except for Diana and Barry.While having this on the tv, it felt no different as to having it off...I didn't like the original Justice League but thought I'd give this version a go. The trailers were good, but 2.5 hours in I've had ENOUGH! Even that was painful enough to watch. It was a CHORE!", "Snyder's \"Justice League\" is an improvement, not a perfection": "What was once an internet pipedream has become a reality. \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is finally here in all its bombastic glory.This specific version of \"Justice League\" was never meant to happen, and neither was the 2017 theatrically released version. Snyder's original vision was for this movie to be the third part in his DCEU series, directly following \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". Snyder left the film in post-production after a devastating family tragedy. Distributor Warner Brothers - not wholly satisfied with the path Snyder was taking - brought in \"The Avengers\" director, Joss Whedon, to retool the film into a more light-hearted affair.What was released in theatres contained very little of Snyder's material, and was widely disregarded as a disjointed and forgettable mess. The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement was born immediately, with hundreds of thousands of irate fans demanding that Snyder's original version be restored. After years of campaigning, Snyder and his fans have been treated with a golden opportunity that looks to right the wrongs of the past.The general plot found within Snyder's version is nearly identical to the one in the Whedon cut. The evil Steppenwolf, a loyal follower of Darkseid, has come to Earth to claim three mother boxes that wield unlimited power to conquer worlds. Honoring his promise after Superman's death, Batman assembles a team of superheroes to stop Steppenwolf and unite the planet to defend itself from threats beyond the stars.Snyder adopts the \"Seven Samurai\" approach to his story as the first half takes an individual look at the members of the team. They each get backstories in varying degrees of quality, with some being more embarrassing than others. The Flash's introduction will act as a litmus test of your acceptance of Snyder's excessiveness.Above all else, this version of \"Justice League'' is an infinitely more cohesive and enjoyable experience compared to its predecessor. It's also fun to ponder and discuss with others, unlike the migraines I get every time I think of the Whedon cut.The film looks and feels like a single production, and not a Frankenstein-like mashup of competing ideologies. Gone are all Whedon-directed scenes and the color saturation levels have been reset to Snyder's usual palette. The intricacies of the story have been completely retooled, giving characters such as Cyborg and The Flash more characterization and things to do. Superman no longer has his infamous CGI baby mouth. Steppenwolf is less embarrassing as he is visually reworked and supplied with a proper backstory and motivation. Tom Holkenborg's score and Fabian Wagner's cinematography are also allowed to flourish on an unparalleled epic scale.Now, these improvements are not to say this a perfect movie. Stripping away the benefit of comparison, Snyder's film carries many of the foundational problems that have plagued both of his previous DC films. The newly revised script provides the 5 Ws (and one H) for each story thread, filling in the gaping plot holes present in the Whedon cut. The problem is that a few of these storylines aren't necessary or that interesting, to begin with. And the writing is still filled with cringe-worthy exposition with attempts at humor that don't mesh well with the self-serious tone.Snyder's insistence on using a 4:3 aspect ratio - more commonly seen in arthouse films - seems to be a decision based more on him being seen as a bonafide auteur rather than just improving the picture quality.At 242 minutes long (yes, that's four hours), the film requires a gigantic investment from the viewer that isn't fully warranted. Scenes are stretched to the nth degree by incessant slo-mo and a few deleted scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor have found their way back here.The nearly thirty-minute epilogue is entirely spent on setting up sequels that are unlikely to ever be made. Its inclusion feels like an attempt by Snyder to rally his troops once again to demand the story be told his way. No matter how much it drags the story down and erases a lot of the goodwill built up to that point, Snyder's ideas are much better than anything else being offered at the moment.Even though a much tighter and free-flowing three-hour cut could have been released, there is a complete singular vision here, one that Snyder has carried throughout his DC films. His vision may not always succeed, but it is something to be championed.With many blockbuster films leaning ultra-safe to guarantee box office returns, Snyder's no-holds-barred style is the answer to Martin Scorsese's comment on comic book films lacking an authorial voice. For better and for worse, a filmmaker was the driving force for a major franchise, which is more than one can say about the corporate machine attitude over at Marvel.An experience that may never be replicated again, \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is a mythologically epic film that delivers more than anyone could have imagined. It may not always work, but it sure does pack the punch that fans deserve. If you have the mental and physical ability to invest four hours into this monumental project, I recommend you do so.", "My point of view as an 20 years old from Nepal": "After following up varieties of movies from DC, i started viewing the positive aspects of live and how one should never let any negativity damage our positivity. Keep fighting the negativity and winning over them. I promise even in my old days, i will enjoy this movie and help people spread positivity. Life is good and great. It reaards for ua goodness in this world. Keep smiling, keep loving. Hate js useless.", "THIS IS THE JUSTICE LEAGUE": "THAT! That was a Flipping Justice League film \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f it didn't even feel like 4 hours.

Make the Synder Cannon please someone get this trending on twitter (I don't have it) #TheSnyderCut #makethesnydercutcannon FANTASTIC ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC", "It makes so much sense.": "This is thw appropriate length of the movie, the story pacing is right, the scenes makes sense. Masterpiece", "Much better than the theatrical version": "First of all, the reason why this movie is so much better than the theatrical version is because the theatrical version omitted wayyyyyyy too many important elements and subplots that could have saved that movie. However, the plot is basically the same as the theatrical release, and the villains are still not great, even darkseid. Cyborg's subplot was criminally omitted in whedon's version, and it's thankfully restored here, which I thought was the biggest difference between this version and the whedon's one, even more than darkseid's appearance. Cyborg felt like the most unimportant character in the previous version, but here he's a very important character. The 4-hour runtime is a bit excessive though, at least to me. Maybe if I hadn't watched the theatrical release, I would think differently. Overall, this is a much better version of Justice League, but it's still far from an excellent superhero movie. I dont really like the casting of ben afleck, jared leto, ezra miller, joe manganiello, and especially jesse eisenberg. I really hope the future DCEU films will be much better.", "Never thought we'd be here": "After many-a-struggles, we finally have the only version of Justice League even worth spending a second thinking about as far as I'm concerned. Can't believe that I just experienced 4 hours of pure joy. Although to be fair, considering how much I love Man of Steel and BvS UE, Zack Snyder could have released anything and I would have appreciated it. Thankfully though, this also happens to be really good. I love that now I have a trilogy of epic superhero-ness within the DC Universe that I can watch and enjoy anytime. My only wish is that Zack gets another movie to conclude all the little plot points that he set up here by the end. Either way I am happy now. Thank you to everyone who made this possible.", "The superhero movie that saved the DCU": "When I first watched the first justice league I could not have been more disappointed, but Snyder and Nolan made it happen. While this movie falls short to thelikes of the DKT it still proves the DCU has more to offer then just batman, and I think it is the best movie since the DNK in the DCU.", "Best superhero movie to date": "There have been two superhero movies that have been far and above any others before of after them. Those two movies were \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\". That was before we got the Zach Snyder Directors Cur of Justice League. This second chance movie gave us a movie that lived up to its hype. Every moment is beautifully scripted to show us the greatest team of heroes ever grouped together. The black and white version brings even more class to this beautiful film. It will live in infamy for years to come.", "DC fans can be proud of this.": "Redemption done right.I was skeptical at first. I think most of us were. Snyder showed up big time.The aspect ratio, the slow cuts, the different parts, you can complain all you want, but they added to the film. Snyder's directorial vision was achieved through them creating a much more cinematic film. This film had so much more meaning, so much more depth.The changes, sorry, CORRECTIONS to the original film have turned it to a film DC fans can finally use to compare to the likes of the Avengers.The alterations and rearranging to the story and pacing are unbelievably important. The story actually makes sense now there is a flow that had been lacking in the original garbage.With such great and unexpected hints to the rest of the DC universe this is the mighty birth of the DCU, let's hope they don't mess it up.", "Best": "It' s a great movie for DC. Love it. The best DC movie till now", "Being overhated and overrated at the same time": "Obviously ZSJL isn't gonna be some all time masterpiece but it's an entertaining movie and debatably the best in DCEU. There are 3 sides of opinion for this film.\n1 Snyder cult that think this is peak fiction\n2 Snyder haters who hated it after 1 hour watching\n3 General watcher with diverse opinion on the theme and atmosphere.I think we all can agree it's too long, right?", "A lifeline": "It shows the importance of writing, and its endeavors have banked a movie that sets itself apart from the original.It feels like a different movie, and that's the best part. You can't help but argue it's runtime, a lot of it feels as though it could of got away and shaved at least 30-40 minutes at the expense of removing drawn out scenes.Yet all this time feels fleeting, it's an entertaining justifiable romp that should appeal to many fans alike.", "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING": "This movie is exactly what I expected to see the time I watched a screening of the theatrical version. This movie is definitely competitive with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Could this movie may have been broken down into two parts had this been the original release? Perhaps yes, perhaps no, unfortunately we never will know how the success of this version would have impacted the DCU. I just hope this inspires vigor to reprise the vision of creating a Cinematic Universe that will rival the MCU, with comic book characters that are more classic and enjoyed by many.", "Loved it!": "It's so much better than the first movie! (Probably the best DCEU movie and one of the best Comic Book Movies) The Cyborg scenes made me almost cry. The Knightmare scenes in the movie were fantastic and gave us a look to the future of the DCEU. The CGI was perfect, especially Darkseid and Martian Manhunter. The Speedforce scene was one of the best scenes in CBM history, Barry's lines were amazing, Chris Terrio did an amazing job.", "Don't even compare it to the 2017 release": "It's breathtaking to see the redemption of this franchise by an epic, 4 hour long masterpiece, which so easily could never have happened. This movie is an absolute blockbuster, despite the runtime it's a fantastic watch.", "A Hot, Confusing Mess...but I can't look away": "Wow. Please don't read reviews before watching this. It will either annoy or confuse you how so many people treat this as the greatest thing ever. It is not. The additional 2 hours to Justice League do not make it a *much* better movie. It now resembles BvS as an overblown, convoluted, strange mess. Snyder seems to conflate time with development. Just because you give characters more screen time doesn't always mean they're better developed. The plot simply does not warrant this length.Yet...if you watched the trainwreck that is Whedon's JL, this is miles better. It's actually cohesive. It sounds time on character. It tones the humour down but has a bit more of it, so it feels for tonally consistent with the other Snyder films. I have to say I enjoyed picking through what was Snyder's and what was Whedon's. I don't think this movie, as is, would have EVER made it to the cinema. I do like that this feels like a totally different film, even if the second half is clearly where the two films share the most DNA.And so, I'd say if you're a curious need, like me, grab a buddy, grab some beers and snacks and watch along.", "It's really awesome movie": "Great movie worth watching.Story is awesome.Visual effects too good.", "From Someone Who Hated MoS and BVS": "When this Snyder Cut of Justice League was first announced I was incredibly cynical about it. I mean we already had seen the \"Snyder Cut\" of two previous DC entries \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v Superman\" and they were both quite bad. Man of Steel had some good moments but both films were incredibly dour and sucked all the fun out of watching a comic book film which to me is meant for escapism.Nolan's Batman series was more grounded in reality and worked out great with a darker tone for that reason as did \"Joker.\" But when it comes to Superman I would expect there to be some hope and optimism given that he can essentially do anything. And to date we had just been presented with miserable dreck.I was a fan of Snyder prior to the DC films but he had sullied the image I once had of him and I was not looking forward to another Justice League. But I was way off on this one. Not only is this one of Snyder's best films but it might actually be one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. All the characters are given their moments to develop where there is something in each of them to get invested in. And when it does get to the action scenes each of their strengths is played to perfection and none of them feel useless as was in the theatrical cut. And most importantly the heroes actually act heroically and the optimism and hope I wanted is built up spectacularly to the final action scene.It really is mind blowing how Warner Brothers tossed this aside in favor of the final product that they got which in hindsight was a complete gong show of a production. And while them panicking is understandable after the failure of the prior two Snyder films, this one actually leaves you wanting for more of the Snyderverse.If you're of the opinion like I was that this is a vanity project willed into existence by toxic fans, set all those preconceptions aside and just give it a chance. Because it really is completely different than what we had been given before.", "ABSOLUT": "Warner Please Continue this Journey into the heroes dimension!\nThis film breaks any barrier", "Classic DC, Snyder, a craftsman with bad script.": "I want to rate this film with a 7.5. I admire the dedication Snyder put in this film, but I have to be honest. DC has always been the guy who arrives late at the party, asks for the aux cord to put his music and starts playling old songs no one wants to hear.The movie is great and entertaining. If you are looking for a good FX CGI movie, this is the one.", "Wow...": "I know very little of the DC Universe except for the common players like Batman and Superman but it didn't really hinder the understanding of the film. This is just an absolute masterpiece and at 4 hours long I still wanted more.The pure artistry in this film is consistent from start to finish, the color pallet really set the mood, breaking it up into 6 chapters plus an epilogue was brilliant and despite my initial concern about it being produced in a non standard cinema screen size was found to be more engaging.", "Too long, too much slow motion, poor aspect ratio": "If you just reduced all of the annoying slow motion scenes with terrible music, you would end up with a movie with a reasonable length. The aspect ratio is annoying too. I get it's formatted for IMAX, but given how this release was fully intended for home streaming, why subject viewers to a distracting boxed picture?Don't waste your time.", "I didn't know what to expect, but I was blown away": "I was so confused to see justice league pop up in a trailer, I didn't know if this was just a simple directors cut with a couple changes here and there ... but no! ... it was basically a completely different movie and in my opinion was a spectacle from start to finish. I love that it built the story more and it seemed more consistent in mood, the 2017 version seemed a bit shallow, yet this had so much more emotional depth and connection to the characters and plot. Zack Snyder should be given full direction in future films if this is what he is capable of. Safe to say ill be watching the next one Snyder directs and my faith in DC films are starting to be restored.", "We got what we deserve": "Best DC movie till the date . We finally got what we deserve. I was eagerly waiting for this movie . Till now my brother has seen this movie around 10-15 times.", "First Review": "Just wanted to review this film as I enjoyed it so much after watching 10 minutes of the original, this even surpasses endgame and Infinity wars.", "Snyder falls short on character interaction": "Every. Single. Film.This Justice League is so much better than the original, by a mile. But it's clear what Whedon was trying to accomplish with what he was given. Snyder doesn't know how to make characters properly interact. I don't give two cents about the characters that were written in this script. I love all of the heroes that are being portrayed, but there's little to no depth in the ones in this movie. Batman, Cyborg, Superman... All of these characters are just actors reading lines only to push a story plot along. There's very little reaction to the other character's lines, none of the conversations seem organic. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Flash don't suffer from this quite as much but they're still very poorly written into the script. Zack Snyder simply doesn't know how to direct characters. After seeing Ray Fisher's dialogue, it's no wonder he was cut out of the original as much as he was. Snyder did are terrible job having him in the movie. Great backstory and amazing CGI but his only lines are to say words to people, not react or show any assemblance of other people talking. Ben Affleck, same exact thing. It makes for very single dimensional characters that don't make you feel like they're someone you should care about. When you rely on fans of a series to prop up your characters at the expense of actually writing compelling figures to look up to, you'll always alienate non fans from a series. This is the major difference between the Nolan Batman trilogy and this current DC Universe. It's not Affleck's fault that Batman sucks, he's directed and scripted to be awful.This was a huge issue for Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman, and now Justice League. We can joke about how dark the Snyder films are but that isn't the issue. Keep the fanboys happy by pumping out films and it'll sell, but this is honestly just another flop; especially to people who aren't already fans of the heroes.Overall I wasn't impressed but I loved the action scenes and there are some amazing dramatic moments. I'm also glad Cyborg and Flash were expanded on. I just can't get over how poorly Snyder's characters interact.", "Decent-ish I guess": "Decent, not amazing.It was okay, I thought. Like it was better than the sh\u00a1tstorm that was Batman V Superman and Justice League, but it wasn't like, that good.Cgi was still horrible in most cases, Steppenwolf looked like he was made out of paper clips and his face was goofy as hell, most of the green screen was terribly done. There was a scene early on with Lex Luthor in some water or something, oh my god was it genuinely awful.The acting was bad for the most part also, the worst of it being from Fatfleck and \"Kal El no!!!!\". Gal Gadot is a model, not a damn actress and she's always pulling this angry-looking model face, I was just cringing throughout the entire runtime. Speaking of runtime, it's too long. That scene at the end, with the \"joker\" (if that's what you wanna call whatever the hell Jared Leto's portrayal is), in the nightmare world or whatever, it's not necessary and it adds nothing to the story.The music was good (except for the terrible Wonder Woman theme, I hate it so much, it doesn't fit the character). Other than that it was actually okay.The editing was awful. Each scene jumped from one to another with no actual flow.The direction wasn't the best. Most emotional scenes didn't hit for me. The acting was boring and so was the action. I was bored to death watching superheroes punch and blow up aliens for the millionth time, they need to move on from that already. It was cool in Avengers and it was dull by Age of Ultron. Maybe it would've been better if it was made by a guy that knew how to make movies.The script was mostly bad too. Every line was trying to have some deep religious connotation, which came off as pretentious and annoying. Also none of the jokes landed. The flash's especially made me want to suck on the barrel of a sawn-off.In conclusion, it wasn't that bad, but I still wanted to die when it was hinted at that batman banged the joker, and when the flash referred to himself as a \"snack-hole\"???#dontrestorethesnyderverse", "Better than the original": "I can't believe Joss cut out the flash reversing time and victors story arc. But by far the best part is the end credit scene with the joker and Martian Manhunter. It is great that we get to see Zack Snyder's original vision at its full length.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League review (2021, Zack Snyder) While it still has flaws this is far superior to the theatrical version.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021, Zack Snyder)\nWhat is the Snyder Cut? If you are in the know then this qustion has an obvious answer, but I think the passive film fan isn't quite as in the know. In 2017 Warner Bros. Released the theatrical version of 'Justice League'. During production Snyder's daughter died and he excused himself and the show went on with Joss Whedon finishing directorial work. Apparently he incorporated a lighter tone and trimmed the running time down drastically. This led to a bomb at the box office for what was supposed to be DC's counterpoint to Marvel's Avengers films. I think the DCEU (DC Extended Universe) has been wildly erratic. Most of the films were complete trash. 'Wonder Woman' and 'Aquaman' started to right that ship to some degree but there is still no sense of cohesiveness across the brand, and 'Justice League'? I originally gave the film a C+. In a recent rewatch that was kind of generous and I feel a C- was a more deserving grade. Bland special effects combined with a derivative story and a super hero team that didn't really seem very team-like all combined to make a muddled mess of a film.It had long been rumored in the industry that there was a version of the film truer to Snyder's original vision sitting on the shelf somewhere. It seemed unlikely though that this version would ever see the light of day. Then came 2020. There was a pandemic and theaters shutdown and Hollywood is still reeling from the fallout. That situation superheated the streaming wars and a newly christened HBOmax needed content to generate excitement and subscribership, and one of the nuggets they decided to use was the Snyder Cut version of 'Justice League'.This version doubles the running time and going beyond what you might think of as a typical director's cut this plays like an entirely different film. I honestly hope someday it gets a theatrical release because it would be amazing to see on the big screen. Warner supposedly spent an additional $70 million to finish special effects, get additional footage and finish post production. That $70 million shows. The effects are far and away better than the original and it is predominantly apparent in the villain Steppenwolf who is a CGI character and has armor that moves and titters and a mouth that actually looks like it is accurately verbalizing his dialogue which is always a plus.I am not going to delve too far into the story as the fundamental overarching story of 'Justice League' remains the same. Affleck's Batman is gather DC's heroes who include Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg to fight a supernatural threat to Earth's existence from another dimension. That threat takes the form of a big nasty known as Steppenwolf and his army of parademons. There are three artifacts known as Mother boxes that form the Unity which functions as a Change Machine which is going to turn the world to an uninhabitable hellscape paving the way for an even bigger bad in the form of Darkseid to take possession of yet another world as a universal conqueror. Our band of heroes are able to use a Mother box in order to resurrect a recently deceased Superman (who died, spoiler alert, in 'Batman v. Superman') and he turns out to be the game changer. The heroes are outgunned until he shows up. Superman is, in this incarnation, inordinately powerful allowing the heroes to eventually have the day.Many of my criticisms about the film itself become null with the Snyder Cut. This version makes sense and looks amazing throughout. The action is very well presented and there are some sequences that are downright spectacular visually. Snyder took out most of the ridiculous humor and a few scenes that bordered on sexist/misogynistic. In the original version I am not even sure they mentioned Darkseid although he was alluded to. Here he is actually a character and the plot is laid out with much more thought so an audience not well versed in DC lore can actually understand it. Superman dons the black suit which is pretty cool to behold as well even though the black suit gets no explanation. One thing I did not understand with regards to the plot is at some point in history Darkseid threatened the Earth with annihilation before and an alliance of Gods and Amazons and Atlantians foiled him and that is how we got the Mother boxes, but somehow they didn't know where this world was or that we had the Mother boxes? Because you just forget or misplace the one world that defied you and the artifacts you need to secure your victory? And I still do not know what his anti-life thing is they stress in the movie as sort of an addendum to everything else. And in addendum to that the post apocalyptic bizarro team up scene at the end really had me scratching my head. Just laying fanboy groundwork I suppose, but lost on this noob. Despite that I believe this film in this finished form is clearly much better. The issues stem with what it is attempting to do with the DCEU as a whole which are the same issues I had with the DCEU before in that it is too clearly wanting what Marvel and the MCU has and they want it now, but they don't want to do any of the work to get there. This film's plot seems very much like an 'Infinity War' light. They threw basically three films out and said let's do our 'Infinity War' whereas Marvel put out 21 film before it got to 'Infinity War' and all that additional time, effort, data and groundwork shows. What is sad is that there is groundwork laid in the Snyder Cut for some interesting DCEU things but because Warner Bros. Continues to mess up the model none of it will ever see the light of day. Thus while the Snyder Cut is pretty cool it still feels like it missed its window and it is a day late and a dollar short. This is a good film to watch though to get an inkling of what the DCEU could have been in the right hands.Eric's Grade: B.", "a great movie": "The critics who are not a fan of thia type of movie are saying that is bad..Consider that are doing a great mistake..it's perfect", "Zack is absolutely a genius": "This version is unbelievable. Background music is just fine with every scene. All cut characters previous are shown. The plot is more fluent as well. It's just a different movie!", "I wish I didn't watch the first one": "It's better than the first movie and they should hire Zack Snyder to be responsible for all DC movies.", "The true Justice League": "This is what we should've gotten back in 2017 not that horrible studio madated atrocity.", "A Masterpiece": "The Snyder Cut of Justice League it's a masterpiece when we talk about Comic Books adaptation to Cinema.\nThe Soundtrack, Photography, character development it's just perfect.\nWarner should be lost its mind if they didn't do a sequel of this movie.\nThe presentation of the characters it's a must. Cyborg, it's the wire that connects everything, and the heart of this movie.\nAlso the return of Jared as the Joker it's also an outstanding and grateful surprise.\nThe Exterminator, Martial Manhunter, Superman with Black Suit.\nEverybody made this film with such care, affection and dedication.\nThe idea's not to compare with Marvel. Both studios make great movies and the SnyderCut it's already a classic.\nWarner, HBOMax, AT&T: #RestoreTheSnyderVerse before it's too late. And forget the 2017 version, please.", "\"WHY SO SERIOUS\"": "This movie is overhyped by the fans.since they have waited so long they are giving 10/10 to this.nothing new in this just visual effects,slow motion action scenes some emotional since etc.i will say don't waste your time on this.", "Essential viewing": "Forget the 2017 version, this is the version you need to see. 4 hours whizzed by, all characters have a back story and great action. WB need to let Snyder do part 2!", "Vast improvement on the original": "Vast improvement on the original in every way. Arguably the best DCEU film.", "The true version of Zack Snyder's vision.": "The additional two and a half hours of removed footage sheds light on so many characters. There is added backstory to Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman. Also extended scenes with the Amazonians. The buildup between chapters is great and the IMAX 4:3 aspect ratio is really impactful on the screen. The reshot scenes towards the epilogue hints at potentially more to come. I hope Zack can continue with his vision and come back for JL II and III. I'm happy for him that he got to complete this project. Ultimately it's an astounding epic akin to Lord of the Rings, but for comic book movies. I would highly recommend it.", "More CGI than a Pixar movie": "The CGI is incredibly distracting- so much so that the bad story becomes irrelevant and I could have gone to watch a Pixar movie instead.It is of my opinion, that superhero movies are in no way ready for live action cinema releases. The reluctance of directors to change atmospheric tones to suit actors and locations only makes such movies feel rushed and unenjoyable.There has been a handful of movies that have got superhero storylines right, with Christopher Nolan being one of those directors. Wesley Snipes' Blade came close, but there is a long way to go before I can end up believing anything I see from the genre. And escapism should be just that.Though, I can at least buy into a superhero movie when the storyline is of a particular standard, but when it is this bad (Justice League) it is a waste of time to put yourself through.", "What a waste of 4 hours": "Seriously,I don't understand why so many positive reviews. This is way worse than theatrical Justice League & to make the matter worse, the background score is awful. Cheesy dialogues. Worst CGI. With this kind of movie it may take more than a decade to compete with Marvel. Sad but true.", "I wish I had not watched it.": "It was incredible. I can't believe the studio decided to release the piece of garbage that went to theaters over this. The reason I wish that I hadn't watched it is because they set up what would have been an epic series of movies to follow this and I know that I will never get to see them come to fruition.", "Better than the original.": "A few problems with the flow of the movie but the most jarring problem was Amber Heards accents...yes Accents. Most of the cast actually have a likeability issue. That didn't transition well except for the Flash and Batman: they still had charm.", "Epic!": "That is my favourite superhero movie now!\nEVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.\nTHANKS A LOT ZACK.", "Blahh": "It took four hours to make a two hour movie. The four hours went by fast enough but Not once did I get an emotional response. That on top of exposition after exposition. I don't care about all the silly reviews this movie sucked. It had great effects and it wasn't awful but for all the money and screen time it was a failure.", "It's decent.": "So, I'll say this. I rate things with 5 being about the average movie.6 is decent or okay to me.I am not too much of a fan of the way Zach Snyder films. For me, there wasn't enough meaningful dialogue and there was too much slow motion. The action was really good, but some character's didn't feel right. The Flash felt off and Cyborg too.The movie could've cut some stuff out. I think they resolved everything well, then they had Batman have a long dream that felt like forever. I think Jarred Leto is a horrible joker, I was hoping they would not have him, but they did.Overall, it is better than the original.", "What I wanted from Zack.": "The version I wish I originally got to see, made so much more sense, it's the same story, at some points you could be forgiven for thinking this is going somewhere else, but that's purely because you (me) has seen the first version.\nCharacters are fleshed out more. The superman section in this is most probably the biggest and best change for me.\nOne of my biggest gripes from the first one was when superman is flying around at the end and saying 'is this guy still bothering you?' talking about the main protagonist.......?! Also the whole superman is going to hate superman when he comes back to life section is gone..... I remember sitting there thinking why will/does superman hate batman?! Made no sense to me. Anyway, does it change the wheel? No.\nIs it a better film? Hell yes.", "A marvelous redemption of a mediocre movie.": "Characters from the theatrical cut, such as cyborg and the flash were quite bland. But in the snyder cut, they are thoroughly developed and much more interesting. We are given a deeper look into the dc lore and are properly introduced to Darkseid and the retcon of Steppenwolf is a delight. His New and more menacing design serves the character more justice and makes it possible for the viewers to take him seriously. Overall the previous plot holes are properly filled in and the characters, for the most part, are served the justice they desvere. I hope the studio sees the potential in the extended cuts of snyder and sticks with them during his other realeases.", "Better than expected but definitely one for the fans": "I am not generally a fan of superhero films, I don't know the lore or have any particular investment in characters. So I watched this from a point of neutrality, although I had seen batman vs superman. Overall I was quite pleasantly surprised. It is absolutely too long and massively indulgent and I honestly cannot understand how this version of the film couldn't stand to lose 30 - 60 minutes at least from the 4 hour runtime. No film should be this long but when you put that to one side there is a lot to appreciate. It was visually stunning with a very distinct, dark, gritty aesthetic that I really liked looking at. The action was constant and convincing. It had more CGI than than I've ever seen in a film but it was also some of the best I've seen. There were some really cool locations that grabbed my interest but you were knee deep in action and devastation before you had a chance to appreciate it fully and I guess that could be said about the story too. The narrative is rapid, sparce and a little confusing; this was not a masterclass in storytelling but you get enough to keep you watching and I can easily see how this could be everything a hardcore fan would want.", "Now I want a sequel..": "I really wanna see the apocalypse/ injustice (?) storyline now. This was sooo much better. God bless you Zach.", "Beautiful, Visually Stunning, Hopeful": "After several years of campaigning and fighting for this film's release, I was so excited to see it when it launched on HBO Max! I knew a lot of what would happen in the film as I've been following the movement for years. But I was shocked by the lighter tone, and the humor. It's a bit different than Batman v Superman, and I was expecting that same tone. Upon my second viewing (I usually watch a film twice to figure out how I feel about it), I realized how emotional this film really is. So many beautiful scenes too. The message of overcoming doubts, of hope, was so prevalent in the film, and sometimes almost made me tear up. The battle scenes were epic, the soundtrack was fantastic, and this film just stuck in my mind for the whole day. It's going to be really hard for me to enjoy another comic book film after this now, because this has set the bar so high. It is definitely the film I needed in my life right now, and so glad that Zack's vision was released for everyone to see. Definitely a must watch for any DC fan.", "Worth the Wait": "A beautiful gift to all the fans.\nMust watch for a comic book fan.", "Most epic superhero movie ever made.": "It doesn't feel like 4 hours at all. Honestly it should be longer it was that good. We need a sequel asap. The music is on another level. The CGI is in point. The characters are so fleshed out and the scenes in this movie are the most epic and emotional and fun scenes to ever be filmed for a comic book movie. The ending is an absolute thrill ride. Each character is done complete justice and I am so glad Zack was able to finish his vision. Even if there are no more sequels, this trilogy of movies he has made so far is some of the best comic book to picture adaptions ever. Always watch the director's cut if you have the option is the lesson we learn here.", "Too Long": "The movie did answer some questions from the theatrical version, but it also lost almost all of the humor and it was way too long. 4 hours is too long for any movie.It was even darker. It was much more suited for a miniseries on TV. That is how it should have been produced. The theatrical version had its problems, but at least it some fun.", "Brilliant": "Beat superhero movie ever made. This is how you bring comic books to live.\nEverything in this movie was well thought, especially the last scenes.\nThe main cast was brilliant, Ezra Miller was surprisingly delightful as the flash and Ray Fisher was fantastic as cyborg. But the star of this movie was the Batman, Ben Affleck, he really tied the whole movie together and his dynamic with Alfred was pure gold.Everybody should see this movie, really a piece of art that's going to be studied in art schools for years.", "Still just ok": "This was a marked improvement as a remake but still was comprised of vapid characters that if they died, the viewer wouldn't really care. The special effects are good but overall the writing is just bad. 4 hours of a movie and we still don't actually know any of the characters. And fact is, the plot sucked, it was just a movie about reviving Superman so after three and half hours he could save the day rather than the justice league.", "I need to see more of this Justice League": "Although movie has some flaws but man the way it differentiates itself from rest of the colorful superhero movies is just incredible. The flow of the story was a little slow but each scene wanted me to see more. I am giving this rating not just to appreciate the work of the director but to let him and the studio know that the director and this story has the potential to go beyond a superhero film series. Just give another chance to this Universe and release more in coming years.", "Absolutely outstanding!!": "What an epic masterpiece of a superhero movie and testament to Mr Snyder and his ability to finish his version of the film exactly how he wanted it. Much more coherent than the previous version and done on such an epic scale that I am left wanting more. This is how WB should make DC films and I beg that they please allow him to finish his story arc. This film should make Marvel sit up and take notice that they don't have the sole rights to grand comic book movies. Utterly brilliant!!", "Hardest part is knowing it might not continue": "The negative critic reviews are simply because it doesn't associate with any of today's norms. But the truth is, the film is exceptional. It is four hours for a reason: Story development and character driven.Snyder does for women what he did for men in 300 with the Amazonians. Darkseid is a towering villain along with Dasaad (I really wished there was more of them). Now you understand why Steppenwolf was such a confusing character in 2017's Justice League. He was just a minor piece in a much larger puzzle.The Flash and Cyborg are both fleshed out, and play far bigger roles than in the previous version. It's just a completely better movie. No bubblegum lines. No humor added to make it like Marvel films (Marvel films are great because the humor works for those awesome characters). Humor doesn't work for this universe. Like Thanos, as his threat became darker near the end of phase three, you can understand why this DC universe is a serious one, and why it's dark in tone. The threat is dark, and it's a terrible future Darkseid promises.I absolutely loved it. The action is crisper than before, scenes make more sense, and the addition of a few characters sucks because... well... there no guarantee we'll ever see them again. And I really, REALLY, want to see them again.This makes me want to go and watch the previous films in this universe because Snyder's version makes everything make more sense... Even the Flash dream sequence in BvS makes sense now.Great film", "Beautiful movie": "Take your time and do things right!\nThats the moral of the story.", "Justice done for the league!": "DC has always been my go to for comics and films I've always felt more of a emotional connection to the characters over the marvel equivalent so while most people seemed to be in love with the mcu I always just thought they were ok movies well done but never loved, my love was for the dark knight trilogy donners superman burtons Batman and when they announced the new dc universe I was excited I loved man of steel it wasn't perfect but having that emotional connection to superman probably helped me to see past some of the imperfections then Batman v superman again I really enjoyed but because it was so different to the mcu I felt it didn't get a fair chance with the majority, the lazy comments like too dark and no joy really bothered me not all movies have to follow the same 123 steps like the mcu movies do. So that criticism brought us the poor justice league movie which seemed to bring the end of the dc universe. But thankfully we now have synders cut and it is a masterpiece the best comic book movie since the dark knight trilogy ended i watched the film in 3 parts and it worked we'll do it in one go at some point but just wanted to say I really hope they restart the universe surely we need to see where this story goes. A great film you can keep your mcu thank you I'll take superman, Batman and the justice league every time!", "Better version of JL original's cut": "The way of directing was awesome everything was perfect aligned and 4hours I enjoyed straight. Every character even villain or hero did perfect role, I don't care it is R rated but I really like the way Zack extended version of original movie. I enjoyed and feel this should be the original movie, the dark, but It would be better if it wasn't filmed in 70mm 4:3 I like to watch movie in 16:10 ratio widescreen. I think Warner Bros. Should let him (Zack) to continue the storyline.", "ZACK SNYDER JUSTICE LEAGUE": "Zack you are great. What a fantastic movie . Soundtrack,editing was on point. Just Wow!!! We want justice league 2 because ending of this movie tells that darkseid is planning something again and lex luthor also ran from the jail. #restorethesnyderverse.", "Terrible": "I watched this because I love all the comic book heroes coming alive on the screen. Frankly I gave up after a while. The CGI was a massive help with this decision with it's constant interruption of the live action. I have seen better CGI in the introductory sequences of computer games from the 90s", "Thank you Zak Snyder and the people who made this happen": "I was probably one of the few who thought Justice League was ok, I'm probably bias though as I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved Man of Steel, Dawn of Justice, Watchman, 300 even the film about Owls as you can guess I'm a big Zak Snyder fan so for me to get up at 7am this morning to watch Zak's Justice League was a dream come true. All week I've avoided spoilers but have heard that it's good. I knew the previous one was not what we wanted and it wasn't Zak's work but this coming to screen now after all this time. The dedication of fans to get this released and for all involved in the production to get it finished is something short of a miracle but here we are. I'm not gonna spoil this for anybody so I'm just going to say one word to describe this WOW. As a 45 year old man who has grown up with comic books as it's all we had back in the day. These characters have been a big part of my life through good times and bad. The thing I love about DC is that they don't make movies with kids in mind there for adults. I love both marvel and DC but the adult edge to DC is what I appreciate as an older fan. Zak hit this out of the park it is everything you could of wished for and then some. It's the gift that keeps on giving for the full 4 hours. Yes it's long but so was the Irishman and everybody loved that. I don't mind the run time as it takes each character deeper and the whole story is flushed out. I actually watched the 2017 version last night so I could compare the two and there is literally no comparison. They are two different movies in tone, story, even colour. Yes there are still elements of the theatrical cut but they are very few and far between and blended in much better so it's seem less. This is like a complete remake with the same cast. The only thing I didn't like was it's filmed in imax and the black bars are on either side of the screen instead of the normal top and bottom like in widescreen. After a few minutes though you kind of became engrossed in the movie and you forget that they are there. I'd give this a 10/10 as a comic book fan it's everything you could want in a superhero movie for adults. What more can I say without spoilers so go enjoy with plenty of drinks and snacks. Thank you Zak and everybody involved in bring this back to life it is an absolute epic masterpiece to rival anything Marvel have produced and believe me I love them all even Green Lantern. Enjoy", "A Masterclass of Filmmaking": "How could someone watch this amazing cut of a film and decided to go with the Josstice League? Whoever is in charge at WB and DC Films need to get their head off their a**es. This movie is epic and a classic gamechanger.It only took me 90 seconds from the beginning of the film to feel that this is gonna be the best DCEU movie. It amazes me how a few seconds of scenes and dialogues cut from the previous film completely changes the whole story. From cut action sequences to cringey jokes and dialogues courtesy of the 2017 disaster created by Joss Whedon and Geoff Johns, this movie is a complete 180\u00b0 difference. It is day and night difference.All of the characters in this movie shows how powerful they are and clearly knows how to use their abilities. Even the Amazons and the Atlanteans, they were given proper time and moment to shine in this movie. Everyone is just as strong as everyone. This is a real Justice League movie, a league of heroes with great teamwork.I would never thought that there would come a time where I would be completely torn to choose between The Dark Knight and Zack Snyder's Justice League as the best superhero movie of all time.", "Why ?": "Why? The 2017 release was not good, and recieved well, it can partly be blamed on Joss Weadon, but he only added ekstra sceens and changed the story slightly.. so why, make a 4 hour version of a movie that wasnt good to begin with ?Of course i understand that ZS want to show his vision.. it just dosnt make it a good movie.", "Actually worse than the original": "As others have said there appears to be some fanboy-ism in the ratings. Perhaps people think they need to \"vote\" or somehow counteract a wrong. Well, that is your right I suppose, but don't pretend this is an amazing film because it just isn't. From the original release, the pendulum has swung in the other direction and we get a clearly bloated result. It really needed about an hour of dead weight trimmed out and saved for the deleted scenes or some kind of \"ZS's JL Extended Cut\". As-is it took me days to watch this because my brain was just screaming out due to the punishment. I'm sorry ZS fans, but this is a classic case of quantity over quality.Modern film seems to be in decline. Viewers have been demanding a continual high throughout and they have been getting it. The consequence is that the basics of filmmaking have been lost. Somehow I can sit through 3 hours of the extended cut of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" glued to my screen, but ZS's JL almost drove me to madness after 30 minutes. Hopefully there will be a fan edit at some point. No, not that kind of fan...yes, that kind...Also, I must say the aspect ratio is a mistake.

Numerous moments where the characters motivations felt poorly written, and the acting is often so full and emotionless it feels like they are just reading the script. This movie is entertaining, and an embodiment of blockbuster franchise films. They cram in as much fan service and unnecessary action that rarely pushes the plot forward as possible, just to go for 'shock' and 'wow' factor. If you like The Avengers then you'll like this as well, they are almost carbon copies with the exception being this film is rated R (for no justifiable reason other than to add more shock). A few moments I literally gasped with how rediculous our heroes choices are.It could be much worse, there are some pretty shots but that's about the highest complement I can give it.At least 1 hour of the 4 hours are just slow motion shots of action scenes or people walking. I actually recommend turning the film into a drinking game, where you drink any time there is a slow motion scene.Take it for what it is. Big budget fan service. Don't expect much logic, don't expect fully developed characters. Do expect about 1 hour of slow motion.", "Epic Part 1 to a Lost Trilogy": "The story surrounding the production of this film was tragic. I'm very glad to have seen Zack's original vision restored. Controversial or not, I'm happy fans pushed for it.The film is far superior to the cut we saw in 2017. The story makes more sense, the characters are fully fleshed out, the action is more intense and despite the long runtime I was thoroughly entertained all the way through. Cyborg's character especially gets redemption here as we see the beginning of a nuanced, emotional story of a complex character.I would have very much liked to see Zack's original arc play out (it sounds like there were going to be 3 Justice League films). I'm a huge Marvel fan and don't see the morose, darker tone of the DCEU as a bad thing. I would've looked forward to two different universes, one with a lighter tone and one with a darker tone as I think there's room for both. Unfortunately, the response to BvS (although I loved the ultimate edition) led to a cascade of reactionary responses. I hope the DCEU learns to embrace its darker tone and develops its own identity instead of being overly-fueled by Marvel, money, and competition. I think there's still an audience for it.Overall, regardless of what happens in the future, I'm glad I got to see this film.", "I want to give this 10/10 but because of language I gave 9/10.": "Watch this movie not 2017's Justice league.

I want to thank everyone involved that finally made the Snyder Cut Possible. I also watched the B&W one Justice is Gray. Another Awesome creation.", "Four Hours of Pure awesomeness!!!": "Oh man part 2 is still years from now and I'll definitely rewatch this again before watching the second part!", "This makes the theatrical version obsolete": "How did this happen? I am a fan of many things Joss Whedon has made and I'm sitting here thinking how did he mess up this bad? How did anyone see this and his version and say let's go with yours Joss? Immediately you feel this movie is going to be a much different movie and a much better movie. I'm perplexed because I'm so happy this was put out, but I'm sad because this story will probably never finish being told. Everything from the effects and the action are way better. This could've rivaled The Avengers franchise which I felt was a bit cheesy and not dark enough. I like The Avengers and I'm not judging anyone that loves it. We're all different. I like gritty and dark. There's people out there that have my taste and for those I think this had the potential to be perfect for us. I even want more of that Jared Leto Joker and I can't believe I'm saying this.", "Great interpretation of the 6": "Understanding the original release was forced due to Zacks family issue, and whedons vision being one of \"JFDI\", this vision was coherent, justified and well paced.I wasn't a fan of 4:3 in the home but after a while you don't notice it (but widescreen would have been better)Overall a much better vision finally bough to life by the original director. Oh, Aflek as Batman is a great interpretation and it's a shame he didn't get more time to deliver his version of the character.Some obvious observations, why does Arthur get dressed just to rip off shirt. Why doesn't the boom box hole in the tunnel flood it?Petty observations but all the same it was a good movie.", "In a Loop.": "It's sad that DCEU and Warner Bros have hidden this gem and there won't be Justice League Dark or sequel.This is the master piece.No doubt, Warner Bros have hidden so many things from us.Still want to know why Warner Bros and DCEU didn't allow or shown Green Lantern.Hats off the Zack Snyder. Nailed it.", "Glad it happened": "I first want to say my condolences to Snyder's family. Through everything, he managed to pull this off. It felt complete and gave 'justice' to the true movie.", "A long movie not that long": "First time watching a movie over 4 hours, and I need to watch it in 3 separate days! Although it's long, but it's not that boring ( although some slow motion scene can be faster). The background of all 6 heroes are written, and especially like the sound effect of Wonder Woman. The big boss is huge at first, but why so suddenly weaken in front of Superman. And would more now big boss come to earth? I would recommend this one over the 2 hours version.", "A hands down new benchmark on the Superhero genre": "Snyder you beautiful beast you out did yourself. Couldn't take my eyes of the screen for 4 hours straight.\nNot gonna spoil it but here are some positives and negatives -\n1. It's basically Justice League 2017 but on steroids.\n2. Everyone got a well justified on screen time.\n3. Whatever that dickhead Joss Whedon did wrong, got resolved, especially Ray Fishers on screen time.\n4. Amazons and WW were obvious badasse's as they should be.\n5. Satisfying ending / a new beginning.\n6. Marshan Manhunter came out, not a spoiler everyone predicted who he was hiding as, since Man of Steel.\n7. Every single unsatisfying scene from 2017 got a good finishing.\nNegatives:\n1. Absolutely hated that aspect ratio, wtf man!\n2. Nothing else", "EXCEPTIONAL!": "... what an exceptional piece of art! Visually inspiring. \ud83d\udd25", "!! 4 hour Epic !!": "This is how the movie should have been. WB need to understand that how DC comics works. The comics are dark, story oriented and emotional that's what sets it apart from Marvel. They don't need to copy Marvel, DC comics have epic storyline's and they just need to trust on it. Marvel have their own formula for their success story and they are winning with it, Let's not make DCEU movies like that. Fans of DCEU expect the best and they deserve it, you have gods as Superheroes and let's give them that respect with great movies for DC.I had goosebumps all the time throughout the movie, being a superman fan and the way he was shown in comeback is just a icing on the cake especially flying in black suit and taking power from Sun.There was no dull moments in this movie, everything was there for a purpose. Cyborg and Flash are true winners in this movie. Batman being back as he is a treat to eyes, and seeing Wonder Woman in the action form is a delight after Wonder Woman 84, aquaman shines in his moments as well as all the supporting casts.Don't miss it, don't go with bad critics reviews. This movie is epic and it needs to be seen by all. For me it was an experience of watching 4 hour epic", "For me, the Joss Whedon's version doesn't exist": "This is the straight away sequel of BvS for me and the Joss Whedon's version doesn't exist. Those who are saying there aren't much difference between both the versions please watch it again. Zack Snyder gave us so many new dimensions through this movie. Easily one of the best comic book movies ever made. Loved every minute of this 4-hour extravaganza", "Marvel is going down time to re up Zack": "After watching the Marvel stuff after End Game I can see that they are going to go down in flames. People will be begging for the Snyderverse. Oh wait they already are. The good thing about Justice League is that they are embracing the fantasy instead of trying to teach you a lesson. Or in the case of Loki just trying to fill empty space with more empty space. Disney is ruining Marvel and Star Wars, come on Warner Brothers now is the time!", "This was excellent": "I'm not typically a big Batman fan... or Superman for that matter. I just find the Batman world too dark and humorless. Within 10 seconds of turning Justice League on, I realized I was going to have to watch Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman if I wanted to watch this one. I had seen and enjoyed all the other relevant movies. I can not say I loved either of them, but they were good enough for me to get through them. I was really hoping I liked this better. Well, I am so glad I watched it. It was incredibly well done and so great to watch. It was very long so I'm not sure how I would have done with it in a theater, but since I was at home I basically watched it as a four part streaming show and took breaks every hour or so. There isn't any of it I would have cut out so I'm pretty sure I'm happy I never saw the original release. It's obviously set up for another one so I really hope they do it.\nI'd highly recommend it. Great film.", "The Assembly Cut": "After the death of Superman, the Motherboxes awaken, attracting the attention of Steppenwolf. He has terrible things in store for Earth. Can our heroes possibly stop him?With several years of hindsight, a 70 million budget, and near complete creative control... this is it? It's very widely agreed upon that the version of this that hit theatres was average or even quite bad. I'm not here to argue against that. It is 100-percent accurate. But now that we can compare... most of the bad parts of the script were apparently part of Snyder's vision(undoubtedly it will thrill his biggest fans to see his Ayn Rand-inspired views on the supposed superior individuals put back in), and Joss Whedon(while I make no excuses for his abusive behaviour, I do think it is quite clear that he is the superior writer) did the best he could to fix the broken narrative that was handed to him. In most ways, this is only better than the 2017 version in the technical aspects.A 4 hour running time doesn't have to be a problem. You know what does? Bloat. Honestly, it feels like execs at HBO Max, desperate for a fighting chance in the streaming wars, specifically asked that Zack make this as long as at all possible. Trimming 30-60 minutes, at a bare minimum(maybe closer to twice that), from this, would be a massive upgrade. I will grant that some of the added material does improve the final product. Certainly, given how excellent Ray Fisher's performance is, it's no wonder the frustration he's expressed. I am glad that we are now able to see it. Although obviously it wasn't necessary to re-release the same bland, average story to accomplish that. Those scenes should have just been included on Blu-Ray, either integrated, or separately.This features some strong language and violent, bloody gore(considerably less than I had expected. Has he learnt restraint? I'm impressed). I recommend this only to the fiercest DCEU tribalists. 5/10.", "This is what the age of heroes look like!": "This is it, This is what the age of heroes look like! This is just how the Justice League should be! Intense! Darker! Absurd! By telling the story in different parts, Snyder has allowed it and the characters to develop properly. A lot of backstory is given to certain characters, and it only makes things better in hindsight. Normally, films this long tend to be just slower and dramatic, but while there is indeed a bit of slowness and drama, Snyder has packaged it with so much action that there is technically no point you can think of pausing. I am really curious for the story to continue in future movies.", "True Justice arrived...": "Really we deserved our superheroes to be dark serious and all drama we expected 3 years ago. Being a DC fan it was the most epic film ever made by dc cinematic universe.", "MUCH better version": "Don't even waste your time on the Whedon version and just watch this one. It's much better, darker, and tells the full story as it's supposed to be told. It fills the gaps that the first version has. Yes, it's 4 hours long, but that 4 hours goes by very quickly. And....best part........there is no CGI Superman face!!!! It's the real actors face. Thank goodness!!!", "Very good but,": "Thanks to Zack Snyder for one of the good-made superheroes movies, the dialogue between heroes was interesting and preparing for future of DC world, superheroes had better image than before, but the movie is long, the fight scene would be better if it had more time, Superman should have more scenes as he is an effecting hero along the happenings of the movie, the image size is old-fashioned. In general, the movie is very good.", "Thank you Zack.": "I can't express how good i felt while watching it. JUST LOVE IT.", "Snyder did it justice": "As long as the movie is, everything has its purpose. And you may need to watch it a couple of times to pick up on fine details that makes everything so much better.The only downfall for me was Batman's involvement in the grand scheme of it all.The theatrical cut was like a crappy trailer, this is the real deal.", "All around better film": "I do not care about runtime!! The longer it is the more time you have to setup complex characters. There wasn't a single thing I disliked about this movie. I'm forgetting the other one happened. Please bring on a sequel and allow Snyder to have full creative control.", "Justice Served": "Finally, we got to see how the Leagues' relationship/bond developed with proper story telling and interactions like the comics rather than just thrown together in Whedon's Cut. The background of the Mother Boxes story is so much more evolved and allows you to become heavily engrossed that you don't even realise the time that passes while watching this cut. All the other details of the film i.e. backing soundtrack (characters theme tunes), visual effects, extended and more brutal fight scenes just add to how great this film should have been done the first time round.Well done Zack, stay true to the genre.", "Magnificent epic story, in every way better than the JW botch job": "If Avengers Age of Ultron, 2017s Justice League and Angel tell us anything it's that Mr Whedon has the ability to suddenly run out of talent after taking one good idea (those being The Avengers and Buffy respectively) and trying to re-do it.I'll admit I've always found Snyder's films a little hit and miss. 300, for example was enjoyable for one viewing only, and being a fan of the Watchmen graphic novel I found that film's pacing a little off.However, with this particular 4 hour gem, I think Mr Snyder has completely absolved himself of any past cinematic sins he may have committed. Thanks to his vision, his fans' determination to allow him to fulfill that vision, and also the assistance of the Warner Brothers / Whedon tag team basically managing to make a joke of the theatrical release of his poor mutilated baby in 2017, Snyder has pulled it out of the bag.This film from start to finish is exactly as long as it needs to be to tell the story it wants to tell. The redone ending I won't spoil for anyone, but it is a 300% improvement on the original and even breaks the laws of mathmatics in being so.I know Snyder has not expressed an interest in creating the follow up which this film is absolutely screaming out for, but I'd hope with carte blanche and NO STUDIO INTERFERENCE - you hear that WB? - he has the potential to make a film which brings even the MCU to it's knees for a while.", "4:3 format is the big disappointment for me": "I liked the extra details in this version but the 4:3 presentation really diminished it. I was so glad when I was able to buy widescreen laser discs in the 80's the pan & scan never looked right for any epic film. Big mistake.", "Yes well deserving": "Thank you Zak this was the version we DC fans needed Darkside amazing yes beat that marvel", "Marvel fan for life but ZSJL is amazing": "MoS and BvS were good movies but not great. But ZSJL was amazing. I am a Marvel fan since the 80s but I was blown away how good this movie is. It not at the level of the first Avengers movie but that's okay. ZSJL can be great all on its own.", "so much better!": "This movie is SO much better that the version that was bungled by Joss Whedon and the misled executives who brought him in! The first one was fun, but bland, and made me shrug my shoulders a bit. THIS one was the lengthy, epic extravaganza it beeded to be, and left me salivating for a sequel.", "BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE": "Justice league with zack snyder best combination\nFantastic movie. I am speechless..", "Reduced due to casting": "It was a sort-of watchable, although I only made it half way through as it's about 10 hours long.The rating was reduced from 6 stars, which is sort of OK but not very good down to 1 star because of Amber Turd the violent criminal who committed domestic abuse against her girlfriend and got arrested for it, then committed domestic violence against her spouse and continued to abuse her ex-spouse for 6 more years as well as her sister, friends.It also contains Ezra Miller the violent criminal who has committed multiple and habitual acts of violence against women, strangers, breaks into the homes of strangers and threatens to murder the people who live there, attacked a woman singing karaoke at a karaoke place because she was singing karaoke, hitting her in the head with a chair that could have killed or permanently injured her, and is just generally a dangerously unstable violent criminal.So, due to those 2 the score is 1 star because those 2 can suck it.", "The Justice League we all deserve!": "After 4 years WE (all the fans around the world) have got what we want. You see and feel every single drop of sweat that was put into this movie. The scene of the apocalypse is just beautiful and when you're watching you feel goosebumps all over the body.

Please, WB let Zack do his thing and help us bring a sequel!", "How can you NOT like this...": "This is how the story should have been told. Apart from some questionable 'Flash' scene's and the 4/3 ratio it was a Great movie. Love the end epilogue scene's especially the one with the Joker. Shame we won't get Part 2.", "Redemption for DC": "This version is a big improvement on the original and a much needed victory for DC fans out there. Marvel has been crushing it for years now, and DC fans deserved better than the first cut of this film. Well Snyder delivers!Sure, the movie is probably too long (run time of over 4 hours!), but it gives more time and attention to the characters which will delight fans. There are also some strong (typical Snyder) effects complimented by the film score which create more memorable moments than the 2017 version.There are still some cracks in the foundation here as this is by no means an all-time great. However, it feels much more aligned with the epic adventure we've come to expect from superhero movies.", "Zack needs to be back!!": "First thing first! Joss Whedon! What did you do!!!???\nUnless he deliberately sabotaged the DC Comics over his Marvel Avengers, it does not explain.Zack's DC Comics interpretation is accurate. I can see his dedication and putting this slow development for each characters. 4 hr was not enough to bring all the heroes to the audience.\nDC needs to produce movies for each characters, baddies and goodies.I applause all the fans who brought this Zack's work to HBO Maxx.I cannot wait to see more of Zack's DC Comics movies...", "Omg": "Please jus put Zack Snyder/Christopher Nolan in charge of the DCU already.

Outstanding!!!MORE OF THIS PLEASE! MORE ZACK SNYDER JUSTICE LEAGUE", "The Way it Should Be Seen": "Details but few, if any, spoilers.\nFirst off; I am one of the few who enjoyed the original release but I always felt it was...lacking. It seemed \"pieced together\". It was \"entertaining\" but I always felt there were too many cutesy, Marvel wanna be scenes that it detracted from the depth that was available in these rich characters.\nNot so, with the Snyder Cut.\nThere was so much in it that was, obviously, cut from the first version as a consequence of bad editing. I am not going to go into explicit detail. It would take too long. Suffice it to say; this is an entirely different movie from the theatrical release. There was a depth of background detail, character building and motivation that is unmatched in \"comic-book\" movies. The story development felt organic and well thought out. (Zack nailed it.)\nPlus; the ending was completely, and wonderfully, modified, (ergo; different).\n{I absolutely adored the Black Super suit!}\nI was happy to see that Ray Fisher's Victor Stone/Cyborg was incredibly (beautifully) fleshed out as a person and character.\nThe minor changes and myriad additions only added to the wonder that is the Snyder Cut. All of the actors are perfectly suited to their roles. A stand out, as in the theatrical release, was Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash. He brings just enough humor to the team without being the \"class clown\" they turned him into in the original version. Gal Gadot is so great as Wonder Woman, I love Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Henry Cavill does make me \"believe a man can fly\" and Ben Affleck...what can I say? He IS the Batman. I could watch his Bruce Wayne in a dozen films. (Jeremy Irons is a wonderful addition to the Pennyworth legacy as well.)\nThe cameos/revelations were great and well placed in the story.\nMy final word is; this is the way it should have been released the first time around. At 4 hours/2 minutes it is long but worth every minute. Not a piecemeal film trying to emulate a cartoon from the 70's but a film that stands on its own merits as a drama first, a character study second and an action movie/superhero movie third.", "This is it": "It's on another level! The first Justice League was disapointing for, but this one is exactly what i wanted.", "Is Any Movie Worth 4 Hours of Your Time? Yes. But Why Rated R?": "Is this movie worth all the hype and 4 hours of your time? Is any movie? Well... Yes... If it is on TV. It was brilliant for WB to put this on HBO MAX. Nobody would sit in a theatre through a 4-hour movie, and being rated R would cut out a massive percentage of your core audience from getting in the theatre. Put it on TV, and you can take breaks at your own pace. You can even come back to it another day. And adults would watch it with kids in their living room rather than being forced to sit in a theatre for that long. Great plan - I hope it pays off.Justice League is well worth your time. Very epic and well-done. Definitely the best DC Comics movie since The Dark Knight trilogy. DC has not held a candle to Marvel until now.I only have 2 real complaints about Justice League - and the rest was great.First -- It just needed a little bit of editing, which would not have hurt the story at all, and it could have been PG-13. Why add some blood and vulgar language and go for the R? It was BARELY an R. I have seen rougher, scarier, bloodier PG-13 movies. To purposely throw in some blood spatter and a few F bombs to get an R makes no sense. Cursing superheroes? Really? Is that necessary? Why add that and risk cutting out the core, young audience? If you are wondering if you can let younger ones see it... I say yes. You will never be able to skip the few, fast parts that make it an R, but they really are not THAT bad. They hear worse at school and see worse on Netflix.Second -- I wish there was more Superman. Superman is by far the best superhero of the JL bunch and has not had a decent movie in decades. I understand that this is how the story is written, but I was just looking forward to finally seeing him back and was disappointed he really was not in it much.Zack Snyder saves the DC day. Impressive, considering it started as such a mess in production. Hats off to that director. I'll probably watch it again and can't wait for the sequel.", "What a great redeem for DCEU": "No spoilersBut if you watched the first one, forget everything and come with fresh eyes, because its so different.Very well made.\nWell done.", "Well rebuilt.": "Of course, this work is well made. I mean, the director did a good job on the previous part of this episode. It could have worked better to some extent, but it was good. Everyone must have liked the first moment and the last 40 minutes of the film. All the characters were done as they deserved. I loved flash and the part going back to the past. In general, I did not care what Meta says, zack Snyder, you made this movie great.And the last word DC wants is a beautiful planning for its works. We know very well that it has a lot of characters and unfinished stories.", "Much better than the previous version.": "People have been waiting a long time for Snyder Cut. Finally it came out. And we are totally satisfied. But they left some cliffhanger though Zack told us that, this movie won't be a part of DCEU. But as a fan we really want this movie to be a part of DCEU future. We want to see Zack Snyder's Justice League trilogy. What he had planned. It'd be a honour to be a part of this.", "THIS IS WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT A DOUBT": "Really explored the characters a lot better and set the movie up for a great sequel.", "Breathtaking Journey": "I could write about this for a long while but I'll try and keep this short. The 2017 film was abysmal and felt so different than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and even Wonder Woman. I followed what happened closely and was saddened how not only Snyder was treated but how the film turned out. So much of the film was blamed on Snyder and his \"vision\" by WB and people that I never thought a day would come when we could see what Snyder wanted to share. At last we can now see it and while things probably were added that wouldn't have been in 2017, it is an amazing film.Action, great visuals, character motivations, heart, emotional depth, and proper treatment of characters are given which was needed in the 2017 \"WB\" version. I could go on about how much this film improves everything mentioned but it would take some time and I'd rather people watch this instead. Obviously Justice League was tainted by those who saw the WB cut in theater but I'm hopeful more people will realize this is much more than just a \"different cut\".WB has done their best to stop this from gaining traction whether it be to minimizing its impact on HBO max, not releasing a North American physical release (as of June 21, 2021), forcing Snyder to do all press for it's release (other than some trailers), constantly dismissing calls for a continuation, and calling the \"snyderverse\" dead. No, WB is trying to bury the popular characters of Superman and Batman in the snyder films by refusing Affleck his batman film and refusing to do a MOS sequel. Instead they are using new actors for both characters. Some chatter indicates we may see a continuation of The Snyder Cut in some form but officially it's Dead.With all of the studio interference and their efforts to stop the Synder version from becoming a reality, we can now see how much better Justice League could have been but probably better since there was no way a 4 hour film would have been released. While the film isn't perfect, it offers so many great things that I hope more and more people watch it. Hopefully WB and Discovery will get enough pressure from people that we can see a continuation with the same actors.", "Fantastic Immersive Movie...": "Just a completely different film with much better pacing with flowing story arcs for everyone that fits extremely well. I would have given it 10 stars but i still feel the Amazonian scenes are a bit awkward because their civilization is a bit dated as if they are stuck in time and never evolved. Otherwise.. i think it's a great film. The fact that the only extra scenes shot for this edit were probably not needed makes me wonder why they needed Joss in the first place. If they had all this footage already, the editors could have put together a very good film.", "I recommended all of you to watch this movie": "What a great movie i have ever seen I'm the one who waiting for it's finally here", "A superhero movie like no other": "Amazing! This movie makes you feel things that no other superhero movie will. This is how you make a movie when \"the whole world is at risk\"... You go BIG.", "A Solid Story with an Epic Scale": "Every year there are films that are altered by studios for theatrical release. It's nothing new, but when something happens to a movie like what happened to Justice League, it becomes a no-win scenario once they decide to change course. Upon Zack Snyder departing the original project for personal reasons, Joss Whedon was brought in to rework the film to the studio's liking. The original cut was roughly four hours in length and after reshoots and rewrites to work out a mere two-hour run time, basically, nothing, other than a couple of scenes remained from the original version. Shockingly, after four years, Zack Snyder was given the freedom and money to finish his project. This is the film that should've hit theatres back in 2017. I'm not someone who defends a project just to defend in either. This is a definitively better film overall.Even the premise is nearly 75% different this time around. Yes, a team needs to form in order to defeat the looming threat, but it's the reasoning that was missing the first time around. After the death of Superman in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, the echoes of his death spanned many cities, being felt by all of these heroes. Once that settled, a villain with an apocalyptic plan arrives, sending his pawn Steppenwolf to attempt his plan first. This in turn brings the Justice League together, but five of them may not be enough. Superman was the beacon of hope for this franchise and his absence makes a huge impact on the overall story.Unlike many other Zack Snyder films that focus more on visuals over the story, Zack Snyder's Justice League puts these characters and their backstories in the forefront. I'm pretty confident when I say that each core character gets about 20-30 minutes of screen-time to themselves in order to flesh them out and give them purpose. The reason all of them are even interested in trying to save the world is pretty meaningful. There are individual arcs for each of them and a few tears even came to my eyes in the final act. I've never said that characters and story were the focus of a Zack Snyder film before, so I have to give him all the credit in the world for that.I would be remiss though if I didn't mention the very solid work by writer Chris Terrio. His screenplay for Argo was fantastic but I also thought that his work on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was less than triumphant, to say the least. For me, he has been very hit-or-miss. After seeing his work redone by Joss Whedon and changed to his liking, I'm now seeing how much his original work was torn apart. Terrio's screenplay for this film, although imperfect, was just a breath of fresh air. Giving every scene room to breathe, I just felt like I was watching an old-fashioned epic.Overall, more than anything, I'm just happy that Warner Bros. realized what they did and allowed Snyder to finish his original vision. This project has been through hell and back. I can't even imagine what everyone said who worked on this film when they watched that theatrical version from 2017. Again, aside from a few scenes sprinkled throughout the movie, this film is completely different. The same scenes from the previous film are extended and more flesh out, the villain actually has a purpose this time around, and every single character is finally fleshed out. Other than characters like Batman, Superman, or Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg are the two characters that surprised me. From start to finish, they were the biggest hearts in the story for me. In the end, whether or not you've seen the original version is irrelevant. This is a very, very good film on an epic scale. Yes, it has issues, but I think this release because it's very good, deserves to be celebrated.", "Interesting longer takes": "Its quite a bit longer than original and has lots of slow motion action and special effects, still not sure if the movie has anything really going for it, however something to watch right now is a bonus.", "Faith, Alfred. Faith.": "First things first - it's superior to the 2017 version in every way imaginable. That's a no-contest. Whedon stripped this movie off its adventure-fantasy vibe, its comic-book lore, mythology, epic scale, grandeur, and, most importantly, its heart. Snyder restores all of it in his definitive cut of Justice League and it was mind blowing to see it.Cyborg, who is at the core of this movie, is incredibly well written and Ray Fisher gave such a heartfelt performance. Wonder Woman is a fierce warrior and a symbol for young girls - not some hyper-sexualized object like in 2017. Batfleck's arc was well rounded, going from a dark character to a man with incredible faith. Aquaman and Superman had the same screen time as that of 2017, but they're their own characters and not just some quippy line deliverers. Oh, and what pleasure it was to see Superman in action without his mustache!As a long time fan of the Flash, I can't even begin to describe how well Snyder realizes his powers - it's something I'll be eternally grateful for. The way his speed is visualized (and used) in the 3rd act is fantastic. Oh, god, that 3rd act and the action sequences that Snyder has produced - one for the ages. There's an actual team and they work so well together to defeat the enemy. It was so much fun watching the team come together. There's a surprising amount of humour in the film, too. Jeremy Irons (Alfred) and Ezra Miller delivered on the comedy front!Speaking of the enemy, Steppenwolf, too, has a motivation and his character, strangely, evokes some sympathy in a couple of scenes. And, he's incredible in the action scenes - fierce, frightening. If that's not a villain, I don't know what is. The tease for Darkseid has me hyped, too.Tom Holkenborg's music may be the most important factor after Zack Snyder. The man's score makes so much difference to (some of) the same scenes we saw in 2017. This movie should be taught at film school - how music and editing choices can make or break a film!Go watch it, NOW! It's everything a DC fan can hope for. It's a must watch for all superhero movie fans. It's got heart, humour, splendid (and at-times trippy) visuals, and amazing action choreography. GO GO GO!!", "Now this is more like it!!": "Review: This is the TRUE version of the Justice League movie because Zach Snyder directed all of it and it stays true to his original Multiple Movie storyline. It is a far superior film than Joss Whedon's Cut.Takeaways:\n-It has dialogue that is Less cringey than Joss Whedon's Film.-Yes, The Movie is about 4 hours long, and depending on how busy your life is, you may end up spending at least two and 1/2 days to finish watching it.-The Special effects and cinematography are far superior than the Whedon cut. Snyder's awesome and serious Blue and grey overtones, were replaced by Whedon's cheesy red and Orange cartoonish mediocre feel.-Superman's Black Costume was GREAT! Whedon changed it to his red and blue costume in his movie, but he shouldn't have.-Batman's Techno Gear Costume is great!-Cyborg was the main character, as Snyder intended. I agree that Joss Whedon did him dirty.-DARKSEID WAS GREAT!! HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CUT OUT!!-It seems that Warner Bros are complete Cowards when it comes to Darkseid, and the DC Comics fans are sick of them continually avoiding to use him.-I mean WB even made it a stipulation to CW that the cannot use Darkseid in their shows because they want to use him for the movies...So to cut him out here and then announce that then cancel the New Gods movie which was also supposed to introduce him is just stupid and cowardice. And they won't even restore Snyder's vision after their success?! COME ON WB!!!! COME ON WALTER HAMADA AND ANN SARNOFF!!The DC Movie leaders are committed to sticking with their Anti-Snyder Plans, but so far, they are all bogus (with the Exception of Suicide Squad II)We are fed up with this and apparently, so is the newly formed WB Discovery Leadership. (They have relieved Sarnoff of her duties, and Hamada is probably next.)But this was a good movie and for many Fans, this is the TRUE End to the DC Movie Universe.Without the Fan following of #RestoreTheSnyderCut, then this actual movie would have never happened. So thank the fans.", "The greatest DCEU Superhero movie": "I don't understand why this incredible movie still have bad review. I mean this movie was great, much better than 2017 version. It has good action, good storytelling, great character development and the only problem with this movie is that it has some bad CGI. That's it. I hope the sequels will happen because it was amazing and it's same as good as avengers movie\ud83d\udc4d", "Magnificent movie": "The Snyderverse needs to return.

Like. Just wow!!\nThis movie is beyond good. And I am beyond happy that the fans (like me) finally had the chance to see the true vision of Zack Snyder's JL. This is how you do a superhero movie, and everything that the movie has is just pure awesomeness! I can't fathom why they just didn't release this from the very start, and I'm talking to you WB. Like this movie is 10 times...hold on. Let me rephrase that, 100 times better than that horrendous 2017, JL. But I digress. Cant hold any grudges because WE finally got the movie we wanted. The movie has everything from character development, story, action, and especially heart. I'm definitely going to keep watching it, and surely will get this movie when it hits in DVD by June. I really hope to see more of this story, but who knows what will happen. So to whomever is interested in watching it or hasn't made up their mind, just give it a go, you'll enjoy it.\nLeaving it off with one of my favorite quotes from the movie.\n\"Make your own future. Make your own past. It's all right now.\" -- Flash", "Stop if you hated the original.": "Snyder didn't save anything. Imagine a world where a 2 hour burning pile of tires gets rekindled for 4 hours instead and is filmed in slow motion with some yodeling Enya as the soundtrack.Ok, so the story makes more sense? Thanks?Y'all need to let it go quietly.", "ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE! The Film to turn this series into the TRILOGY GOAT.": "There must be sequels of this coming. They'd be stupid to not continue this series.The film answered so many of the idiotic questions and pandering all of the haters of the previous films have made.The sheer detail of each character, and their own stories is immaculate and incredibly interesting, and spark imagination. Zack's film proves the death of conventional film length's as inadequate for characters belonging to a universe much bigger than the tiny pathetic stories of DC's small catalog of films before the Snyderverse. We all may have grown up with them, but the potential of what they could be was all put to use and fulfilled with this masterpiece.Unlike CW's Flash and Arrowverse, which keep the DCU grounded in 'corny' as much as the MCU, this is the most comic book accurate film to date that actually pulls it off.The cg in this film was not an issue. My only minor issue is the film not filling up my wide screen tv.PLEASE MAKE MORE WITH ZACK SNYDER, BEN AFFLECK, RAY FISCHER, HENRY CAVILL and the rest of the JUSTICE LEAGUE!!", "The best super hero movie": "Snyder definitely did a great job creating this movie, it's simply the best superhero movie for sure.", "The Fans Were Right, This Is The Justice League That Was Meant To Be": "Okay, a quick review because I think everything that could be said has already been said. Simply stated, this is the Justice League that we were meant to see, this is Zack Snyder's vision and it freaking works. It is epic and goes heavily into the mythos. I enjoyed the earlier Justice League, but this blows it out of the water. Forget the naysayers who are saying it's dull and boring, this is the best comic book movie I gave been for a long time. Darker, grittier and absolutely perfect.", "Not better, just longer.": "4 hours, more context/development to each character, and extended scenes.

Especially Cyborg who a LOT more development than in the previous cut. The action sequences are spectacular. Zack Snyder does a great job drecting the film. The pacing of the film is very solid. And the character interactions between the Justice League are very entertaining to watch. The most pleasant suprise I had with the film was the character of Steppenwolf, who in the theatrical cut was the most generic, uninspired villain I have seen in a long time. But in this version he gets a surprising amount of character depth. Not to mention the fact, that he's a lot more intimidating too. Oh, and the fan-service. The sweet sweet fan-service in this film was glorious. And it made my inner DC fanboy heart very happy.So in conclusion, after watching Zack Snyder's Justice League, only one sentence came in my mind. And that sentence was: #RestoreTheSnyderVerse. Now that would be true justice.", "Loved this": "So good! If your a fan of Justice League you will not be disappointed i assure you. A must watch.", "Nothing compared to this masterpiece": "Zack you are a legend ....

I'd say it's about 15 minutes too long but it's 4 hours so that's still an achievement. I admire that it's not edgy like BvS, but it does take itself seriously. There are jokes but they're not overdone and kinda funny. This movie is a major achievement. One of the best comic book movies ever made.", "Dc's Epic Saga": "This movie has everything fans ever wanted and more. Classic zack snyder style action sequences and slow motion shots. To be honest it's worth the wait.", "Very impressive": "The Snyder Cut.This is about 3 times better than the original Joss Wheedon Cut.\nThe Characters are actually relatable and great, especially, Cyborg, Flash, Aquaman, And even SteppenWolf\nIt's more than just a superhero movie, it's and adventure...Fully recomend it", "No no no no no. Just no.": "...no way can it end here!!This is everything that I hoped it would be and more. Warner Bros are fools if they don't watch this and recognise the fact that they should have stuck with Synder all along.Dark, brooding, slow burning with a superb payoff. Perfectly setup for what could have been - and still should be - so much more to come.Just Epic and I loved every second.Oh and Leto as the Joker is something I now really want to see more of.Bravo Synder. Take a bow.", "LONG But Better Than I Expected": "My cable company is giving me a year of free HBO Max. Warner just released the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League. I never saw the theatrical version so I can't compare, but it wasn't half bad. I would, in fact, give it 4 of five (or perhaps 7.5 out of 10).I have to warn you that it's FOUR HOURS long, so it took me several days to get through it, and that might actually be the best way to watch it. It contains many slower, character-development scenes, many of which surely got cut for time from the theatrical release, and which I suspect that ardent teenage and 20-something Snyder fans wouldn't like. Watched over three days they don't drag as I image they would watched four hours straight.Coming in the same universe where Snyder initially weakened Kryptonians to almost human levels, Justice League really pays homage to the traditional superpowers of Superman. He can take on the entire rest of the league without breaking a sweat, and easily beat the stuffing out of an adversary who beat them repeatedly. For perhaps the first time in the DCEU, Superman really IS Superman!", "The version we all should have seen": "This is definitely the movie that should have been released in 2017. Some people might be put off by the 4 hour long runtime but it kept me entertained and at the edge of my seat throughout. I am baffled by the changes that were made by Joss whedon. This movie tells a complete and coherent story throughout unlike the version that was released in 2017. The movie makes use of each of its primary characters screen time and fleshes them and their motivations out to a satisfying degree including the main villain steppenwolf who seemed to have no motive whatsoever in the 2017 version. The movie also sets up multiple dceu sequels that may never see the light of day unless fans speak out about it as they have done to ensure that this movie got released. Here's hoping we haven't seen the last of snyders dc universe.", "Minor Spoilers For Justice League.": "I like Justice League, although I was disappointed that multiple scenes in the trailers and television spots were either reshot or excised. Although the musical nods to Superman (1978) and Batman (1989) are appreciated, they do not fit this iteration of the characters; however, Elfman's score managed to sound epic when Steppenwolf invaded Themyscira, and when Diana was telling Bruce about the first time Steppenwolf invaded Earth. However, Tom Holkenborg's score is MUCH BETTER. I do not mind The Flash falling on Wonder Woman's soft bosom, since he was saving her from falling debris in the tunnel and because he saw her as the mother he lost. I also did not mind Cyborg's story arc being deep-sixed, since I am not a comic booke reader. The shots of Miss Prince's backside were also not an issue for me. Superman's computer generated lip was AWFUL. Zack Snyder's Justice League is MUCH BETTER. I also highly recommend Zack Snyder's Justice League: Justice Is Gray Edition, and it must be released on home video. I have a few minor cavillations with the photo play, but I LOVE Zack Snyder's Justice League. Watch Justice League first, and then Zack Snyder's Justice League so you can compare the differences betwixt both photo plays.#RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "What fans wanted and received": "After re-watching Wonder Woman, Man of Steel, and Batman v Superman Ultimate prior to watching this movie I came in with a good understanding of the events that led to this movie. I refused to watch JL from 2017 because it was not Zack Snyder's vision and it would be like having the JL without Superman. The real S for this movie was Snyder he directed this masterpiece and brought all this great acting talent together.I do not think a live action JL could be made any better than this. I thank all the fans that pushed to make this happen. We must continue to fight for this level of quality.Thank you Zack Snyder, thank you DC fans, and thanks to all the great actors that made this possible. We are all stronger united!", "The men in the WB hate themselves for the 2017 version": "Yes, finally. If only I can't unsee the 2017 cut. This is mindblowing!", "Hope for DC": "While by no means perfect, i really enjoyed the version of the movie. It is a massive improvement, in visual effects as well as storyline.The regenerated Steppenwolfe CGI was considerably less cartoonish, and the added characters from the JLA comics, really made the wait worthwhile.Hopefully they have learnt their lesson for future movies.", "Snoooze.": "I was really anticipating this to be much better than Joss Whedon's Justice League cut considering Watchmen is a fantastic DC film but man was I wrong. I love Zacks work and his style is timeless but this film is too much even for Zack. This is a film that is almost desperate to beat the first product and it's bad taste. Even with the fantastic visuals it still manages to lack in every other area, dramatically dark and dull cinematography, scattered and messy plot, forced character development, corny dialogue, and it is just wayyyy to long, It is really just boring. After finally finishing watching it I came to the conclusion this whole re shoot was a mistake and kinda failed in comparison to Joss Whedon's work which was actually really enjoyable. Even with all of the backlash from Snydercult the fact is both Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon are both great directors and film makers, but for this film Joss Whedon's style is a much better choice with lighter tone and comedic moments more relatable too real life as well as fits the DCEU and films similar such as Suicide Squad, Jonah Hex, Green Lantern etc. It's really a shame such a great director like Zack has such a toxic fanbase making it hard for DC fans to enjoy all the awesome films we are being blessed with because we just end up with this. A four hour snooze fest with weird accents and no Booyah.", "The best dc movie in years": "This is an amazing movie, this movie has one of the best soundtrack and photography from the entire sub genre of superheroes, the characters are very well written, cyborg has an amazing journey of self discovery, the rest are pretty well characterized except for flash, he was good but Barry deserved more from beeing the c\u00f3mic relief, then steppenwolf is a great villain with a good and most than understandable motivation, instead of darkseid that we only got to knew he was a conquerer without heart, which had an amazing characterization, making me terrified at the scene he appears. The costumes are very well done, the cgi is beautiful to the eye as well as the photography. It's duration may be painful, something I didn't got to experiment cause I've watch it by chapters. In conclusion an amazing movie for the great superhero team the JL is.", "4 hours of boredom!": "Don't believe any of the 10/9 scores on here, most of these people must be on the pay roll! This movie is just more of the same as the original Justice League, nothing new here, just more boredom! and the other new characters Zack has added have small bit parts and have no relevance in the movie.", "I have a second chance, Lo. I am not going to waste it.": "Full transparency from the start. I'm a big MoS, BvS & overall DC fan. Loved WW up until the final act, enjoyed AM, Squad and found Shazam! Average. I want to say I liked the original Justice League but in truth what I actually liked about WB's attempt was the characters. I remember wanting to see more of them together. I remember thinking it reminded me of the JLU cartoons. I also remember Batman cowering on the floor and cringing. And apart from that, I don't really remember a lot else. Up until a few nights ago, I couldn't even remember the ending.I'm also in awe of what the MCU did with IW and EG. The stakes, the spectacle, the sheer surprise ending of IW. The bold beginning of EG plus the incorporation of so many fan moments, beautifully crafted scenes, the culmination of so many character arcs in tragic albeit heroic scenes - and obviously the scale and confidence of EGs \"portals\" ending that I didn't think would be matched for many a year.The reason for the transparency is because I believe reviews are such a subjective matter. It doesn't really matter what anybody else thinks. It matters what YOU think. I've always believed the DCEU under Zach was in good hands - and I'm acutely aware others didn't. I'll argue till the end of time if you place the box office of Phase 1 MCU against Phase 1 DC then money wise, it was on par or doing well. But the changing of tone in JL (and to a lesser extent AM and Shazam) alienated those that had bought into it. For those of us that realised JL wasn't a ZS film, or even consistent of what came before, the rumours of this cut were something to believe in and justify JL could be something more.So yes I'm a fanboy and these ZS DCEU films I have a connection with. So please bare that in mind with what follows. Although I will add, unlike BvS and MoS, I do believe ZSJL will appeal to more people. It's not essential that you enjoyed those films to enjoy this - with the caveat that due to the unforgiving continuity you may not have a clue what's going on if you haven't at least seen BvS. But more on that later.From the very first scene it's apparent this is a different movie. And I make no apologies for this, but anybody who says different instantly loses all credibility. It can't be twice as long and have about 30-45mins of original footage and be the same movie. It just can't. That's literally impossible.It starts where BvS ended, Superman's scream awakening the motherboxes and even incorporating Lex's post credit scene in that film.There's a deeper plot in this movie that involves DC's big bad Darkseid searching for the Anti-Life equation whose power - in true Snyder fashion - is not really properly explained. DC fans will know what it is and there's a short speech by Darkseid where he says how it will render everybody his slave and that's it.In his search for this power he has conquered 100,000s of worlds and the only one he ever lost was Earth - where obviously the Anti-Life equation resides. This is explained in a quite wonderful history lesson told by Wonder Woman to Bruce that is expanded from the original. I say \"expanded\", but let's be true here, it's fundamentally different as in the original cut Darkseid didn't even appear - which is quite a feat in a film that is essentially about the impending doom of Darkseid. This history lesson is wonderfully shot, is full of glorious Easter eggs including Wonder Woman's estranged brother showing Darkseid it probably wasn't a good idea to start a war when the literal God of War is standing on the other side. Its small touches like this that I believe resonate with Snyder fans. In his world, these superhero's are gods. If somebody is going to take out an opposing God, it's going to make sense when looking at their power levels. It's actually going to enhance other films. If you've ever wondered how Ares could have taken out the older Gods as claimed in the Wonder Woman movie, here's exhibit A. It's during this sequence we're also introduced to the motherboxes and there's more explanation here of what happened to them through the ages.Whilst Supes cry awakens the motherboxes to call out to one of Darkseid's henchmen in Steppenwolfe as Earth is no longer protected, the films main villain is afforded a new look and depth. In one of the most remarkable transformations of the entire film, Steppenwolfe now appears as a somewhat sympathetic character trying to win back his masters trust for a previous betrayal, Where previously he was little more than a joke, now he's a formidable and motivated adversary with a singular, relentless mission; his expanded entrances to Atlantis and Themyscira is emboldened with increased violence and taunting. But this time there's a reason for his desperation - he just wants to go home.The film provides a platform to sidelined characters in the previous cut. Flash's arc almost rivals Steppinwolfe's in redemption. From one of the most divisive characters to now an instant legend as Snyder cleverly and carefully restores amazingly beautiful scenes that showcase the trepidation that Barry has with his gifts and his paranoia that he doesn't really belong within the team.Aquaman, whilst possibly the least expanded in this cut is more of the voice of reason. The reluctant hero that has yet to accept his own destiny but finds purpose and connection to his mother during his journey.Cyborg's arc is a completely different experience - to such an extent it's a tragedy that any of it was originally cut. All of his scenes elevate the film, in particular a wonderful montage where he is learning his powers by following a single mother's struggle through cyberspace. There's probably more heart and emotion in that single section then in most other superhero films.Whilst Cyborg's overhaul is rightly the heart of the story and the biggest beneficiary of this cut, Zach's Wonder Woman is truly a sight to behold. Her opening scene plays out with an increased intensity which showcases her stature and throughout the film there is an undeniable presence whenever she is called to action. She has a number of standout moments and if Batman is the father of this team, she is surely the caring mother.And then there's Batman. There's a moment at near the end of the film in the epilogue where he is visited by someone. He's told his parents would be proud. The acting by Affleck in that scene conveys everything that is wonderful about this character. It's a touching moment to complete a complete turnaround from what he was in BvS to what he ends up as. Whilst his action is not as emphatic as it was in BvS, there's a gravitas to his presence, a humanity and hope that has been missed before.I won't mention much about Superman other than in this version, we see what was intended and the true power of the man of steel. Caville IS Clarke. It's a travesty that we may not see him again suit up. There's a vulnerability to him as Clarke, an arrogance to him as Superman - and whilst I appreciate not all will like that part of his character, to me his appearance in this version is the very personification of what Man of Steel was all about - hope.Then there's the ending. I mentioned earlier how I couldn't even remember how the original finished. There will be no such problem with this film. One of the most outstanding pieces of film I have ever had the enjoyment of witnessing bringing everything we love about these films to the table. Massive stakes, proper threats, heroic moments, redemption, tragedy and sacrifice, all brought together with a rousing soundtrack that lifted this film from \"Great\" to \"Exceptional\". It's almost an impossible task to give EVERY character their moment in a finale...but some how Snyder does it...and does it without missing a beat. It's truly exceptional filmmaking.So again, I offer my bias but I do urge you to see for yourself. The runtime is cut into manageable \"episodes\" that are no longer than your average Netflix series. If nothing else, see what the fuss is about. At long last DC,s potential has been truly realised. And if it's a one off, so be it. It's one of the greatest comic book films of all time and whilst there will be obvious comparison to Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, it's true success is not whether the majority of people think it better than those masterpieces or not.The real success is that it's in that conversation at all.", "Snyder Cut Review!": "9/10. This movie is one of the greatest DC movies of them all. It heavily improves the 2017 theatrical cut and while the structure remains the same, the development of the story is so much more here. The character stories are more richer with Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman but especially Flash and Cyborg. There's action, story, humour and love places in this movie and all who worked upon this movie as well as those who fought for its rise should be proud!The reason I give 9/10 is purely that some of the scenes could have been worked on a little more is all, but every fan should see this movie. I never took breaks at all because I purely could not stop!I do hope that Snyder is able to continue his trilogy, I realise that the movies have taken a different direction but maybe in a nightmare elseworld universe or a slightly different story to involve the changes I.e: Shazam, Aquaman, Birds of Prey etc.", "Just the same really": "The 1 star score is just a reflection of Hype + time \u00f7 expectations = the same really. Absolutely an improvement over the original release but I was so very 'whelmed' all of the way through. Just didn't feel like it was worth sitting through.", "The Original plus 2 hours of filler.": "It's the same movie plus 2 hours of panoramic shots while music (often sad) plays. Also it's in 4/3 ratio so you can enjoy the black bars on any device you watch this on.", "Not the best superhero movie but he managed to make it better.": "Admittedly this is not the best superhero movie. The scope of the film, which has been significantly improved by the actors, has also expanded. I'm not a Dc fan or a Marvel fan but I liked this movie.\nReal fans rate it like this ''11/10'' \u270a\u270a\u270a", "What we should've gotten.": "Dude I loved it. I really did. Only reason it didnt get a 10/10 from me is because of minor things. But overall I loved it. It's what we should've gotten before but to be honest I'm glad it worked out the way it did. Besides hardcore fans nobody would've sat in the theater for 4 hours. Probably not even 3.5 hours. The scene where Silas Stone explains cyborgs abilities to him over the tape recorder was one of my favorite scenes. It was more violent than I thought it was going to be. I'll also say Jared Leto redeemed himself. He did to me at least. Proves that dumbass writing and rushed production ruined the first Suicide Squad. Maybe an Ayer cut we will get?? Who knows at this point. But this opened a lot of doors and it was brilliant.", "The Justice League we deserved initially": "After 3+ years it finally happened and it is as epic as it could get.", "Amazing.": "Much needed to bring to light the best movie in the franchise.

This was so awesome!!! kinda left speechless, its like avengers end game level spectacle and epicness!", "Restore the SnyderVerse !!": "\"WE HAVE NO FEAR!!\"\nChills to the core of my soul.Finally, an epic artistic tale by a visionary director of our times.I've been reading DC comics since I was 8-years old, 42+ years on, and I never thought I'd live to see the comics depicted in motion films until I saw 'Watchmen\", but then came 'Man of Steel', and for me the best comic superhero movie of all times, 'Batman Vs Superman', when many complained that they (heros) don't meet in battle until third quarter of the movie. But we forget that they have been around for over 80 years in comics. A masterpiece of film making.Now to even top that comes the ZS, Justice League, an utter brilliance in piece of artistic vision that is beyond anything ever made before in motion picture history. The darkness of DC world allows for the appreciation of the struggles our hero's overcome to enlighten our hopes & dreams, in redemption.Thanks to all those that persevered to bring this to reality for the fans, by the will of the fandom. No we hope the Warner studios have the courage & sense to #restorethesnyderverse.", "This movie is epic and masterpiece": "Its gives the details about the super heroes specially cyborg and flash and nice character development and give justice to batman and other league members\nNow it is essential to #restorethesnyderverse please #restorethesnyderverse please.", "I've never frowned so hard in my life.": "I'm pretty sure I just aged more in 4 hours than I have in the last 10 years. Am I supposed to care about any of these characters? They establish no emotional connection with the viewer with any of them. Every time I thought the movie was about to end, it kept going.

May your daughter rest in heaven and i hope you found your peace.", "Better? Yes. Good? Not quite.": "I am writing this spoiler-free review not as a comparison to the abject failure that was Joss Whedon's Justice League, but as a film standing on its own. Credit where it is due: I commend Warner Bros for having the courage to remake and re-release this movie in Zack Snyder's original image.However, even with the marked improvements to the animation, narrative and character arcs, The Justice League is still far from watertight; fundamental issues with story balancing and plot armour, exacerbated by an over-reliance on CGI and some strange design choices means this movie may fade into the annuls of film history without many people thinking twice.Zack Snyder has been let loose, and it is on show from the first minute. The 4:3 screen ratio is immediately apparent (but unnecessary), and the story already feels slightly more composed and fleshed out. From an artistic standpoint, this is a step up for DC too: good shot selection and some of Snyder's classic slo-mo scenes help fights and expositional moments hold more weight.Unfortunately, this free rein has its drawbacks. So much could have been trimmed at no real loss (or expanded into a miniseries), meaning the pacing is a little bit wonky if you want to watch this in one sitting.Furthermore, the issue of visual effects is still a problem. Yes, Superman's moustache massacre has been rectified, but having enemies rendered in post-production makes their fights look routine and without peril. Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) in particular suffer from the ambition of their designs, having too many moving parts to make them look a semblance of believable.Comedy relief is a real bug bear of mine, and The Flash (Ezra Miller) is the main culprit. Miller's character plays the film's funnyman, making bad jokes at totally inappropriate moments, and for what? Batman (Ben Affleck) and Alfred (Jeremy Irons) are also guilty, making several deadpan quips (such is their uselessness when battling otherworldly enemies). Given the film's more serious tone (a smart decision by Snyder), this oversight is costly in breaking tension and boring audiences.Moving away from The Flash, issues surrounding the cast's performances are still obvious. Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa (Wonder Woman and Aquaman) still can't really act, plus Affleck and Fisher don't particularly inspire. Amy Adams is doing what she can, but she doesn't have the screen time to have much impact. There are so many cameos it's pretty pointless to list them all, but Amber Heard still features, so that's a bit embarrassing.Snyder normally makes music selections I agree with, but his aim was a little off: some tracks work, whilst others feel excess to requirement. For example, every time Wonder Woman has a fight scene, her anthem plays: fine once or twice, but by the fifth time, the wow factor is lost.Fight scenes feel a bit snappier (elements of Snyder's talent), and better represent the gulf between humans and these superheroes, but this gets muddled when you reach the real power struggle. Yet again, it has proven impossible to balance Superman and the antagonists, a fatal flaw when building a story that could go either way.By the epilogue (a bit of a mishmash of events and scenes to set up ambitious sequels), I was completely drained from this four-hour undertaking, but I didn't feel fulfilled. Ultimately, this film is still an unrefined, unfinished product, lacking cohesion at the essential junctures.An improvement no doubt, but sometimes, you have to tear down the foundations to build something truly better.", "Snyder & Affleck.. brilliant combo!": "The movie is 4h long, might sound exaggerated but it's absolutely worth it! First of all because it shows the story of everyone, without ignoring the background of any character (like it happened in the previous JL - Whedon's version). Snyder is absolutely amazing, he manages to create the right dark atmosphere that belongs to the dc world. I would have preferred to have this as main JL movie rather than the previous. We absolutely need him to continue with his Snyderverse!What to say about Ben Affleck... best casting ever. I've never seen a better actor for this role: he looks absolutely the same as Bruce, it's like watching the comics coming to life! Not to mention his incredible acting and action scenes.. it's just a sight! I was heartbroken when he left DC years ago, seeing him again in action is all many many many fans and I wanted.Snyder and Affleck is the best combo for DC, if they keep this amazing duo they'll never fail!", "We need more, we need more....": "This is an absolute superhero movie master piece, exiting, not childish, in other words not disney.\nYou might not have the sentimental attachment that iron man or Capitan america gave you, but this is far superior.\nAll the actors were perfect on their roles, Cyborg shined, I never understood how bad the theatrical version was until I watched the Snyder cut.\nWB please continue this series with the same cast and director.", "4hrs film": "It is as bad as the first film.

The decision to continue with another director so different from Zack Snyder was the wrong move by Warner/DC. But with the sheer weight of fan reaction and campaigning, we now get Zack Snyder's original \"vision.But ZSJL has major issues:\nThere are too many major characters to introduce - including origin story, backstory, and motivation; so although building the team is part of the film, the reasons WHY they all come together is still murky.There are too many story threads to wrap up from previous installations that sap the movie of momentum.There are too many start/stop moments in Steppenwolf's narrative arc. So a ticking clock is set up but the movie has no sense or urgency.And; Zack Snyder's overreliance on stunning visuals and slow motion pull down the pace of the movie in favour of wowing your eyes.I hoped this would be a calling card for Zack's ability to tell a character based story, but just proves that he actually can't. Scene order seems to make little sense, and there is no real sense of the timescale of the movie.At one point I thought \"Man, I've been watching this for at least a couple of hours.\" to find only 75 minutes elapsed.This is easily 4 movies crammed into the runtime of a two part epic, and felt very much like Zack watched Infinity War and Endgame and said \"I can do that!\"Only he can't.I do understand the 8-10 score reviews from the Snyder-fans out there. But I don't agree.It's turgid, overfull, overtly dudebro, a little bloodthirsty, pretentious, oft confused, meandering, with little sense of character, pace, order, or grace. And the 4:3 ratio was a very weird choice.Justice League was a bad movie. Zack Snyder's Justice League is better.

Cut half the slow motion super hero scenes moving fast and this moving is now 3 hours and doesn't have pacing issues. Finally, it's not 2000 the fact this film is shot in 4:3 aspect ratio is unsettling. It almost made me turn it off in the first hour because I was so annoyed.

The WB money machine initially put out a sorry product. Thank you Zack Snyder for coming back and taking the time to give people a good movie - especially after everything you had to deal with personally in the midst of making it.This film showed what DC/WB is capable of, and now (maybe except for the new Suicide Squad) they are descending into the chasm of woke/agenda-driven movies created by Marvel/Disney, and all is lost.", "Much better than the theatrical release": "Driven by public clamour, Zack Snyder's original cut of the Justice League just premiered on HBO Max. It is certainly a vast improvement over the Whedon cut released in 2017. Although I'm not a big fan of DC comics roster of superheroes (other than Batman), I did grow up reading Superman, Wonder woman and flash. Things I liked about this version is that it feels very much like a comic book miniseries , with chapter and titles forming the whole 4 hour run time, each a self contained \"issue\" in a 7 issue miniseries. Also good is the extended characterizations given to the new heroes Flash and Cyborg, and the added depth to the character building gives an extra dimension to the myth making. The villains (Steppenwolf and Darkseid) are given more run time and thus they have become more menacing on screen, unlike in the Whedon cut where they just seemed to be generic CGI villains. Also great that Superman , last seen in Batman v Superman being killed in the battle with Doomsday, is resurrected only late into this version - as it should be - because we all know Superman is the \"ultimate weapon\" for the Justice League, and dramatically , it makes sense to unveil the big guns only late in a story like this. The action sequences also have a better dramatic effect and the individual superhero's powers are clearly and effectively brought out.So all in, kudos to DC fans who made this happen. I like the intro by Snyder as well, and this version clearly shows the love and care he has put in to these characters.Some things I still dislike - the overall gloomy feeling, the portentous slow motion, the overly pointed mythologising of the characters - but generally I would say this is one of the best DC movies made, a vast improvement over the theatrical version, which was, frankly, quite lacklustre and forgettable.", "Far better but too much music, a bit muddled, could have lost 20 mins": "This is a far more interesting film that the original release, most of the humor is gone, but scenes go on way too long, this could have been cut by 20 mins. The annoying use of songs is overbearing in some sequences. One scene that could have been fun is The Flash saving the girl, but instead we get this super slow motion thing with flying hotdogs and we never see the girl again. BTW she would never be driving a mint 1964 Olds convertible worth $50k. And the actor who plays Barry Allen makes him the most annoying superhero ever. Showing Superman in some future vision before he awakens is a mistake. The appearance of Martian Manhunter will confuse everyone. Breaking the movie into parts with title cards is pointless. The black uniform makes no sense.", "Simply incredible": "I always defended the 'original'. Not any more. This movie is beyond brilliant. Why it was butchered so much by JW is beyond me.\nTo cut a king story short, I watched the original version countless times. It was my go to film when nothing else was on. I'll never watch that version again.", "A slow start but a great finish": "Totally different movie to the 2017 Theatrical release. This was satisfying and like overindulging on your favorite dessert.This Cut is the legitimate and rightful sequel to Batman Vs Superman (ultimate version) and Man Of Steel.Yes, It's long. It's a slower pace start but it gives much needed background and depth to Cyborg, Aquaman and also Flash.The story feels well told, unlike before.A great finish leaving me wanting more.I really want more.", "What a difference": "Amazing how a Director's Cut can so much be better.", "I told you this story couldn't be told in 2 hours": "Well, that's an improvement. The original release of Justice League in 2017 was a conflict of visions, mostly made by Zack Snyder but completed with heavy reshoots by Joss Whedon. It was also cut down from what would have been, best case scenario, almost three hours at the time to a svelte two hours flat. Considering the amount of storytelling that needed to happen in that shortened timeframe, it was no surprise to me that it felt rushed and incomplete. Well, several years pass, the \"Snyder Cut\" becomes a pop culture myth, and the COVID shutdown of theaters leads HBO Max in a desperate search for content, so they enlist Zack Snyder to make his original vision a reality. How does it stack up?One of the main problems of the original cut was that there wasn't enough time to develop the three new main characters in any significant way before they got thrown into the plot. This movie fixes that, but there's a catch.You see, ensemble pieces are hard. They're even harder when you have to introduce several of your main characters from scratch. The thing about a story is that stories tend to work best when all of the pieces work together to create one cohesive whole. When you introduce three new characters, along with a large plot about the end of the world, these three characters need to be fleshed out right there, but they're all dealing with different things. Cyborg is dealing with his fractured relationship with his father and the fact that he's part machine from an alien box that was buried under the ground for thousands of years. Flash is an incredibly awkward young man who runs super fast, can't make personal connections, and wants to pay for his college education to help his father beat the false charges that he's in prison for. Aquaman wants nothing to do with his Atlantean people because of something to do with his mother's mistreatment, even though he should be their king. This is all stuff that would have been fleshed out more naturally in stand alone movies that introduced these characters to audiences. However, as one quarter of the movie's first half, they all end up clashing. Add in the fact that Snyder was able to make his film four hours long because of the streaming platform release so that he included pretty much everything he had shot of these stories, and you get a first half that functions but drags. The individual pieces feel overlong, never bad, but also like we're cutting between four different movies instead of four different parts of a single story.The plot is that same as the original release, of course. An alien named Steppenwolf has come to Earth looking for three Mother Boxes that were lost on Earth millennia ago that, when united, will destroy the planet through fire. However, Steppenwolf is much improved here. In an effort to create a streamlined character, the theatrical cut reduced him to obsessing over \"Mother\", and it felt off at best. Here he's trying to get back in the good graces of the ultimate bad guy of the DCEU, Darkseid, communicating back to the planet Apocalypse about his progress, hoping to get an audience with his master, and only beginning to gain the right attention when he discovers that Earth carries Anti-Life (unclear what that is, honestly, I think it's an equation) that Darkseid left on the planet millennia ago when his invasion was knocked back by the combined forces of Earth's Age of Heroes.So, Steppenwolf has to get the three Mother Boxes first. The first is held at Themyscira and that action scene where Steppenwolf steals it from them is decent. The Amazons keeps getting owned in this franchise, but here they at least put up a good fight. The second is in Atlantis, and this comes off like a leaden balloon. There's too much to establish in Atlantis at once with Aquaman, Mera, and Nuidis talking high and mighty about the history of a place we barely know exists followed swiftly by another quick attack that's harder to see and includes a last second arrival of Aquaman that feels off. Well, at least Aquaman doesn't prevent Steppenwolf from getting the Box, so it's less annoying than it could be.At this point, I was honestly feeling kind of a bit bored. We were just shy of two hours in, and I was getting four separate movies in one, and none of them were great though they were all functional. Then the pieces finally began to come together with the team actually forming. First was Flash, who happily joined because he needs friends. Then is Aquaman who joins because of his failure in Atlantis. Then is Cyborg who joins after his father is kidnapped by Steppenwolf's parademons. Together, they bear down on Steppenwolf's location outside of Gotham where he was looking for the final Mother Box. This is where it suddenly feels like we're in a single movie, and despite my inability to fully appreciate the first two hours because of its inelegant construction, the character work in the first two hours begins to pay dividends here.Action scenes have more emotional punch as the team learns to work together against a mighty foe. We get demonstrations of their individual power, but none of them are strong enough individually to take on Steppenwolf and even as a team they're too fractured. The fight scenes have Snyder's visual panache with each hero getting their moment to shine, even if they don't fully succeed. Beaten back, they consider their only potential alternative to fighting such a powerful being: raising Superman from the dead with the power of the Mother Box they have.Superman arises, and he's disorientated, surrounded by people he doesn't know, and he sees the man who had been trying to kill him, Batman, just before his death at the hands of Doomsday. Only saved by Lois Lane, who was nearby to say goodbye to Superman one more time before trying to move on with her life from her sorrow, the team watches Superman fly away right before Steppenwolf shows up and takes the final Mother Box from them, knowing where it was because they turned it on to revive Superman.From this point, all the pieces are set for the finale. Steppenwolf has the three Mother Boxes and begins the Unity that will end the world. Cyborg has watched his father die marking the Box to be tracked, so his motivation is complete. The heroes have doubts because of their failures against Steppenwolf and their inability to bring Superman to their cause, but they have no other choice but to fight. Superman, though, is wonderful here. He doesn't have some grand moment of realization. Instead we just watch him slowly remember with the help of Lois and his mother Martha his final days and come to the realization of how much the League risked to get him alive. He has to help, it's just who he is.The pieces all come together in a large scale fight in and around an abandoned nuclear reactor in Russia (not Chernobyl, though) where everyone has to use their powers and abilities to their utmost to fight off the army and leader trying to destroy the world. It's a hugely satisfying bout of superhero antics that caps with a look at the bigger threat to come as Darkseid ends up watching the final moments through a portal in preparation for his victory, coming face to face with the heroes who would defy him if this adventure were to continue.There's no way Warner Brothers was ever going to release this movie at 4 hours in theaters. There might have been a possibility of a three hour release if they had bent some more, but for whatever reason they wanted no more than a two hour and twenty minute version of this film. For all of my problems about the jagged nature of this movie's first half, that first half becomes necessary in order to create the emotional investment for the final two hours. This is a marked improvement over the original, though it's far from perfect. There's extra stuff added in here and there that I have trouble understanding at all, like why is Secretary of Defense Swanwick, who was in both Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, suddenly Martian Manhunter? I have no idea, and he contributes nothing. The film feels both self-contained and part of a larger whole at the same time, though, and that's a hard trick to pull off.It's good.", "Probably a must for comic book fans": "If you're a super hero fan, this review is not for you. For everyone else, skip this movie.The number of super hero movies i've enjoyed is few and far between. There needs to be something fresh to stand out. This movie is like most of the others.To the film's credit, I found myself rooting for the villains; this is unusual for me. However, the heroes were so unlikeable that the villains were much easier to favour. Most of the heroes are significantly over powered and at no stage did I feel they were at risk. If atomic bombs were detonated over their head, they'd not suffer a scratch. Ultimately, there is no risk for the characters and no investment for the audience as a result. Also, when every character is so op, there is nothing to differentiate them from each other.The acting is ok. The effects are ok. The story is consistent, however, not very interesting. I even nodded off during what's traditionally called the 3rd act.I could not have cared less if the entire Justice League was wiped out in this film. The only character I had any empathy for was Lois Lane and she was an accessory.", "Better but not great :(": "This is better than the Joss wheadon cut but by no means is it a much watch.The story is ostensibly the same (makes a lot more sense) but stretched out/fleshed out over a longer run time. This does help the story carry more weight and make more sense as well as fleshing out all of the characters. However in the end end it does devolve into what felt to me to be a characterless/emotionless CGI fest in the last hour.The special effects are also hit and miss with the worst offenders being early on with a lot of back projection looking effects and poorly rendered physics effects (floaty horses and people). These didn't bother me too much though and were much more tolerable than superman's lip in the original cut.When the film was focusing on character progression it was great, as is the current want though this was thrown away for CGI nonsense in the end. All modern DC films also seem incapable of creating a rounded, impactful character who is not a 'hero', Lois was better her but was still a bit part at best.This lack of human involvement/relation to me really does remove you from the film. The massive amounts of bombast and inability to portray these hero's as in any way human (I know their not) really hamstrings any relatability to the characters.The humour in this film was better than other films like for eg. The Last Jedi and Guardians of the Galaxy where the humour detracted from moments of gravity. I do however think this was more due to the jokes being 'awkward' and not that funny which seemed strangely natural in a human quip kind of way.Overall I found the film to be a massive improvement on the original up to the point that they are so different they are different films. It was an hour too long, the last half hour was awful (really bad) and seemed disconnected with the rest of the film and should have been in thrown in with some DVD extras.So overall original cut was a 4/10 this is a 6/10 with better editing it could have been an 8/10.", "This is the standards we need for the DC Universe.

More recently, after watching Snyder's true version of Batman Vs Superman, the vision is clear. Make sure to watch Man of Steel - Batman Vs Superman (Ultimate Edition) - Snuders Cut.Zack Snyder's Justice League does not fail. Every minute of the 4 hours and 2 minutes masterpiece is truly engaging, story telling at its best, unique and thought provoking. I just wanted more. 4 hours 2 mins wasn't enough.The movie is presented in 6 parts. This is such a refreshing take on a superhero movie and really grabs your attention for each chapter. Each character is given so much depth throughout the film, and just enough to leave you wanting to know more.For those who have experienced a significant grief, this movie really captures bereavement in a sensitive, respectful and beautiful way. Myself and mother watched this together, having recently lost my father to Covid, it can be hard when themes of grief come up in TV or Film. Zack Snyder, I can imagine from his own experience with grief, has really approached this sensitively. It may not stand out to many people, for those who are grieving it's clear as day.Thank You Zack. I hope this series can continue, nevertheless I appreciate this so much.

Each major character grows and develops and changes during the course of the film.With a couple of exceptions, like the Christopher Nolan \"Batman\" films, and the terrific 2019 \"Joker,\" films based on DC comics have struggled to find their footing, and struggled to find their fans.

Also, I feel like Batman is shown through more optimistic lenses, which is a nice evolution from BvS.\nMy only problem is that in both versions Superman is so overpowered that he makes the rest of the League to seem inessential and expendable.\nThe teasing prologue(s) is amazing and gotme very excited, but I now feel that my excitement will go in vain.\nAll in all, this movie made me smile and laugh, got me emotional and left me in awe.", "The beautiful redemption that fans have been waiting for so long": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely a great film, especially if we rewatched \"Man of a steel\" and \"Batman v Superman\" prior to ZSJL.\nIt not only gives all the characters their purposes but also address a lot of concepts deeply. The conversations and interactions between leading roles and supporting casts are full of wisdom and surprises. Wonder Woman and Batman, Cyborg with his father, Superman and Lois, Batman and Alfred, Aquaman and Flash about Cyborg, Steppenwolf and DeSaad, Steppenwolf and Darkseid, and of course, Batman with Joker.However, to me and many fans, this is the beautiful redemption of our beloved Man of Steel that we've been waiting for a long time. Superman may not occupy the most of time span in the film but this film is all about Superman. Been through the growing pain in Man of Steel and the struggles in BvS, nothing more satisfying than seeing Superman in black suit with the S symboling HOPE on his chest to save the day.Ignore those negative critics, go watch again MoS and BvS first, and go enjoy ZSJL. This film is for fans, for Zack's daughter, and is definitely for you. :)", "The 2017 version was bad; \"Zach Snyder's Justice League\" is so much better.": "4 hours and 2 minutes maybe a long run time, but, if you treat this film like an epic, The film is practically perfect. The music is so much better, and has better tones and themes. The graphics are polished. The antagonists are compelling and feel like real evil doers. You get to see more character backstories. You get to see new characters introduced. Everything is just 100% better than what Joss Whedon did. Zack Snyder created a masterpiece. And I honestly hope one her brothers reconsider is having him at the helm of more DC films in a variety of capacities.", "Can we talk about how good this movie is???": "Sooooo much better than its predecessor in pretty much every way. Much more depth and character development (granted, he had four hours to do it). This movie was very satisfying, and left me hungry for more! I hope we can get more DCU from Zack Snyder in the future, though I realize that's not their current plan... new hashtag #bringbackzack \ud83d\ude04", "Now this is the movie we needed back in 2017": "I have never seen Joss Whedon's Justice League as what I heard since his daughter's death was tragic to him. He had to stop what he was doing and take a break. However, instead of delaying the film, Warner Bros hired Joss Whedon, took out many stuff and changes, and made the garbage back in 2017. And with all the #releasethesnydercut on Twitter and everywhere, it finally happens. And I got to see it early. And my god, this film was the best of Zack Snyder's films. Everyone gets enough time to develop their own stories such as Cyborg, Flash, and a bit of Aquaman and Wonder Woman. And what Zack Snyder did with Cyborg was fantastic. And there was a reason why Ray Fisher hated Whedon and Warner Bros. since all the nasty stuff they did behind the scenes. And what Zack Snyder did to his character was the justice he deserved and was, in fact, the heart and soul of the Justice League. I still wasn't too fond of The Flash yet, and I sadly wanted to like him. But I didn't. I did, in fact, like Superman and Batman; however, I felt that Batman needed more screen time and more from him. And I wanted him to be as more menacing than ever. But whatever, it was okay for me anyway. Plus, seeing the Joker in the dream sequence was fantastic, and it was so much better than David Ayers Suicide Squad; however, this doesn't beat any other of the four live-action Jokers such as Heath Ledger, Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Nicholson, and Cesar Romero (To me anyway)and yet I do believe his performance was way better it still didn't convince me with it. However, that doesn't mean it was terrible; it was fantastic what Jared did this time and didn't end up selling condoms to any other cast member on set. And I especially love Darkseid in the film, and that surprise came from a superhero that I enjoyed a lot and jumped with joy when I saw him. Yes, the Martian Manhunter, and he looked fantastic. I am happy with the result that Zack Snyder could come back for and finish his vision. This was, in fact, a considerable improvement from the 2017 Joss Whedon Justice League. Thank You, Zack Snyder and Warner Bros, for letting him finish. It sucks that we won't be getting a sequel to this film anytime soon. Maybe we will, but I doubt it. 8/10", "Did I watch wrong movie?": "Is it a joke, same movie but it has 2 hour long slow motion scenes. I don't get it why some people loved it so much. It was boring and you need to wait 200 min to get some action if you called it as action. It is overrated by fans.", "Loved it.. even with Affleck as Batman": "Thank god they removed those stupid Batman in love with Superman jokes. The Flash had relevancy and the villains very engaging. The only issue I had with this movie was it was not released first. I would have loved to see this on the big screen.", "Short & to the point": "This is the movie that should've been released in the first place. Even though it was 4 hours long, it made so much more sense then the WB release & it was so much more fulfilling. This was a story that should'nt have been cut short but told as a whole. Zack got this one right. Great movie!!!", "It's amazing movie": "I love this movie it's amazing thank zack for this masterpiece", "Finally decent DC ride": "Very nice and layered cut. After that really bad movie that Joss Whedon brought us this was really enjoyable trip into the DC Universe (I am mostly Marvel fan if that counts). The soundtrack is one if the best ones in a while.Some people might mind the 4:3 format, tho. But it is stated that it is to preserve the director's vision.", "Best Superheroes movie I've seen": "This movie is excellent. From a neutral point of view, it's awesome. From a DC fan point of view, this is a masterpiece to me. It is just so good that you may not even want to stop. You might even fell like to watch a second time and it doesn't felt like four hours at all. It may get tiring for some but because it breaks up into parts for people who can't stand four hours movie. The choreography such as Steppenwolf vs Wonder Woman is great. The theme is amazing. Flash and Cyborg play a so important role. The introduction to Darkseid is great and how it link up with Aquaman (2018) pretty well. Steppenwolf not only have a motive but we can also fell for him. There's so much more to say. Some of the down side include some unnecessary slow Mo, some slow scenes and the overuse theme of Wonder Woman but these are just minor issues. There isn't massive issues except for some plot holes with Aquaman and if you are a comic book fan, I recommended it.", "great cast great cinematography great comic book movie": "The snyder cut of the justice league is a great comic book movie! The cinematography looked better than in the original one. The cast is stacked and i would say nearly perfect, henry cavill is born for the role as superman ben affleck is a great batman and i even liked gal gadot as wonder woman. But the story is still a bit clumbsy and the pacing is very slow. I can say this was the best what I saw from the DCEU so far and a well deserved 8/10.", "Magnum Opus": "The film how it should have been. Thank you for giving us this masterpiece. \ud83d\udc96", "The real movie": "This shows why marvel should never touch anything dc and in this version of justice league it shows compared to the 2017 film this is 300 times better with better character development action cgi story well just everything anyone who gives a1 2 or 3 aren't dc fans or hate snyder films go see it you will love it", "The Epic we all deserved": "This is a proper comic book movie, all 4hrs and 2mins of it. There is just so much of the movie to enjoy. The opening sequence is spectacular. Also how the movie is paced and placed. It is never boring. Something important is happening always. Snyder develops characters and builds them perfectly. The loop holes in the Whedon cut are fixed. Also The whedon cut seemed a cheap attempt at making a super hero movie but the Snyder cut is the real thing. It is a proper DC movie as we know . Big budget , big shots , complex plots and spectacular super hero action.Now the only thing that remains is to restore the Snyder Verse and the quintessential DCEU.", "Not much better than the first": "I hope producers learn from this and come to terms that they are usually dead wrong about what the public really wants.I'm still a bit unhappy that hollywood seems to be so lacking in new (good) content that they have to resort to comic books for a story line but hey, I guess that's the way the world turns lately.I always give kudos to directors for standing up and forcing out director cuts, because the studio will always go for the shortest cut and spend the least, just to make a buck.I could not stand the first cut, and this cut was just the same but with more eyeroll moments.The script seemed written by a high school dropout with underdeveloped imaginationBatman running around asking people to join his boy band seemed pretty pathetic.", "Thank you zack. A MASTERPIECE": "The Wonder Woman soundtrack reminded me of Vikings. that was so epic. along with the action scenes, story line, and characters it is indescribable how much better this movie is then joss whedons cut.

Boi!!!!!!Justice League Snyder Cut is amazing and lived up to the hype!\nI really hope WB use this movie as the real JL instead of the Whedon JL, the story better continue on in future DC movies", "Honestly pretty good": "This is a completely different movie than came out in 2017 and the 3 scenes that were the same made my eyes roll because they stood out with how different they were.It wasn't perfect and would have worked better as 2 movies, but is probably the best DC could have done consitering it introduced 2 main characters and multiple villans at the same time.There are things I would have changed, but overall a pretty solid movie. The first two hours are all character development and a little slow, but the second half is well done.The abilities and actions of each hero is also much better and they are all at their best when fighting.#restorethesnyderverse", "Worth sitting through (but thanks for the breaks!)": "This is an entertaining and more complete film than what hit the cinemas. It benefits from the additional length, giving time to allow characters to develop and evolve. The action is sharper, even if the sequences are longer, and Snyder can indulge in some of his cinematic prowess. There are some beautiful shots.It's split into \"parts\", perhaps echoing its miniseries origins. They're useful though if you need \"a break\".My only complaint is the epilogue. It drags a little and seems to set up a multiverse that we're unlikely to see given Afleck is hanging up his cape.", "BOOOOORING AND IN SLOW MOTION": "And in 4:3 to boot, I didn't know you could make a horrible movie any worse.", "A better version of Justice League": "Snyder's cut is definitely better than the original version but it's still far away from being a masterpiece or the greatest superhero movie as many people say. Some details has been changed however the main plot is the same and flawed like the previous version. The movie's Atmosphere, narrative logic and characterization has obviously developed. There are no more stupid jokes in addition to ridiculous and childish moments, so we can feel the seriousness of the events which I believe is the best advantage of the movie. Despite this progress, the movie is unnecessarily long. The amount of slow motion and heroic sence and dialogs are too much and gets annoying by the end, even Joker and Darkseid's appearance can't add anything to the prosseces of the events. This film has an okay directing and editing. Cinematography and CGI is good however the acting and music is medicore at its best.After all I think, Zack Snyder turned a terrible movie to an acceptable one. It's not great but it can keep our hope in DC cinematic universes.", "Wow! It's awesome": "Zack Snyder Justice league is the best movie of the whole DCEU, it's totally superior to Wheedon JL version and now I want to see Darkside invasion and conquest of the earth, Warner should be smart and restore the Snyderverse for the good of the DCEU", "As a film - really good": "I like Superhero films, thought the original was o but this version is so much more complete.\nI think it's better than the last Avengers movie by quite a bit.", "Restore The Snyderverse": "This movie was 10 times better than the original version that was released. WB needs to let this man take over the DCEU and give us phenomenal comic book movies. The story telling was superb and overall the cinematography was amazing.", "\"How many can die in your arms before you grow numb to death?\"": "This film has cemented Zach Snyder as one of my favourite directors of all time. The rallying of cast and viewers to get his version released and the way he presented the content made this film feel more like an experience than anything else. \"Zach Snyder's Justice League\" is hands-down one of the best films I've seen, and doubly so for all comic book movies.ZSJL continues the events that occurred in \"Batman v. Superman - Dawn of Justice\" and contains the same dark, gritty mood that Snyder brought to the DCEU. The film's enormous four-hour runtime gives all the Justice League characters introduced time to develop and for us viewers to forge that attachment to them, and it benefits the film in so many great ways. The Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman and even the Martian Manhunter get a spotlight on them with enough time to explore who these characters are and why they're here (though it's mostly just pulling clues from \"Man of Steel\" and \"Dawn of Justice\" for the Martian Manhunter). The flashbacks of Cyborg, for example, weave a horrific and cruel origin for the superhero, and that puts you through your paces. You feel a genuine attachment for the character and Ray Fisher brings that out every step of the way.But even though ZSJL is a fantastic film, there are tradeoffs that drew it away from the gold star. The biggest blow (to me) was definitely Hans Zimmer not returning to compose the soundtrack. Junkie XL (co-composer on \"Dawn of Justice\") takes the reigns for ZSJL and while he does a great job with the score, the beauty of Zimmer's music leaves a hole no one can fill. But, the lowered budget from the sound department went straight to the effects department - and man, did those people raise the bar. The visuals in ZSJL are absolutely stunning; I love explosions as much as any other guy, but taking the superheroes themselves to another level made the film feel ferocious and very fun. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is really the focus of that statement - Patty Jenkins' \"Wonder Woman\" felt like it compensated action with slow-motion, and that made Diana feel clunky and not as agile and powerful as she is. In ZSJL, she looks ultra-smooth and you can feel the wind on your face as she dashes in and out of combat. And honestly, the visuals aren't just for Diana - all the action looks spectacular, as is the usual with Snyder's blockbusters.I'll never forget the day I watched a 4:3 film about a bunch of guys in spandex fighting a minotaur for four hours, and that's a good thing. ZSJL is worth all four hours and is definitely the kind of superhero movie we need - enough with the feel-good Marvel movies and their kid-friendly undertones. Give us some bloodshed Batman!", "WOW!!!": "It is completely different movie! This is Justice League! Ok so nightmare scenes are insane!\nAnd at the beggining when Amazonians are fighting Stepenwolf and he said i will make you fear me something like that and then Amazonians say \"we have no fear!\" DAAAAAMMN!\nAnd the details in this movie are INSANE!!! Guys we need snyderverse! We need Batflack in his movie with Joker! We need this WB! Please make this", "Must watch": "Zack Snyder's justice league is very different that of 2017 justice league. And it's way way better than that theatrical crap which we all had to endure just because we love DC universe. The climax is different, story arcs are different, acting of all actors seems more appealing and background score is just epic. It's enhance the experience to next level. And the fighting scenes, man they were very well executed and they made my 4 hours long watching a blissful movement.\nThis will surely be the one of the best superhero movies ever made.", "Amazing! Just awesome! This is the justice league we all deserve.": "Four hours goes by like it's just 40 minutes. Everything about this movie is just solid, even got me emotional with some scenes. WB would be silly not to approve a sequel, this is a multi billion dollar franchise just kicking off.", "The era of #releasethesnydercut ends.. now is it time for #RestoreTheSnyderverse!!": "I want to thank everyone who green lighted this.\nnew CEO of WB (you are my new hero dear lady)\nHBO Max (thank you all for the faith)\nSnyder (i mean you know)\nand every other fan like me to get into #releasethesnydercut\nand rest of the other heroes.this movie and the new direction shows that the passion. it wasnt trying to be a bad copy of competitor movie, it wasnt trying to milk the project.\nthe difference was day and night.\nwe clearly saw that the previous version plot holes covered. we clearly see Zack's vision and probable upcoming continuity. it was more clear why actors like Ray Fisher or Jason Mamoa was so emotional when the project get green lighted. because of more fair time for each characters.\nNo need to talk about acting we already know them but we see their dedication better with this version.the only thing bothers me that the people who writes bad comments about DC just because they get paid from disney. well time will show that huge scandal too.\nafter 4 hours of movie fest i just wished to there were more to watch. because of the pandemic i can not go to cinemas since they are closed in my region, but after the pandemic please release this also in theaters so i can watch in big screen too.\nWe live in society, where we start to find honor not as just a distant memory.", "YES!!!": "Zack Snyder has outdone himself. The film definitely exceeded all my expectations. Very good vision. The characters are full, very well developed. So many new scenes, smooth unfolding of the script, great battles. Much better effects. The music too. There is no trace of the blue version from 2017, nothing sweet, sugary or blissful to the brim. 242 minutes and each one is worth it. I will not comment at all on the form of shooting and why this one was chosen. I will be happy to give money to add the film to my personal collection. This is a real movie about super groys and will definitely appeal to hardcore fans, the comments of unknown connoisseurs with constant heartburn will miss with ridicule.", "4 hours is 2 hours too much!": "4 hours is too long to tell a story that can be told in 2 hours.What do you get with an extra 2 hours of footage and editing?1) The story instead introduces darkseid versus steppenwolf as the main protagonist.2) Cyborg becomes the savior of the movie as well as a history of how he came about. This is great if you like a B-rated superhero.3) Snyder must have had flashbacks to the movie 300. This movie had so much unnecessary slo motion scenes, it added nothing to the story.I do believe most of the 9's and 10's are posted by die hard DC fans. If you look at the movie it's kind of a hodge podge of things.Was it really necessary to add the cyborg story to Justice League? Actually not really. It makes sense to remove it.. and instead put it in the stand alone movie that was intended. But still, is Ray Fisher a good cyborg? Not really. His overacting and seriousness for the part wasn't that good.There is a scene where Ray Fishers dad tries to heat up one of the mother boxes. That scene makes absolutely no sense. He has time to escape but doesn't. And even before this scene... the mother box crashes onto a car and Miraculously... Stone's Dad is outside and able to SECRETLY grab the box. It's abit laughable since there are cops in the area and they just ignore it and allow some guy grab the motherbox.Snyder attempts to introduce Darkseid after an hour to tell the history of how the mother boxes came about in earth. It's abit laughable as to why Darkseid would send a fallen warrior in Steppenwolf to get 3 of the most important boxes to him. In the flash back hundreds of years ago.. it doesn't make sense you would just leave with your big mother boxes in the battle for your enemy to take them.There are alot more questionable parts that just don't make sense.The movie relied on the revival of superman. They risk life and lim to revive superman. But in the snyder cut, there is little to be said if Superman goes crazy. They literally don't have a backup plan (unlike in the Whedon version).Again.. this is pretty laughable how justice league is saved from the crazed superman.Are we to believe... Louis Lane just decides to drink a latte.. and is in the neighborhood of where mass destruction is occuring where superman has just been revived. Oh forget the fact she would have to get passed all the cops... just to get to superman.The scene where she jumps in is just so laughable. You know why?There are a few cops in the scene. And Batman calls out \"CLARK!\"Then Louis magically jumps in and also calls out \"CLARK!\"As cops at the scene... wouldn't you be wondering, \"who's this clark guy.. The guy in front of me is Superman, HUH?\"This also confuses me as what happens next is superman flies off.. and Justice League is superman less. They decide.. okay.. time to fight stepanwolf and grab the mother boxes.There is no discussion or even attempt to get superman. They just spent 2 hours saving superman. And then.. \"Oh well.. let's let superman do his thing. Oh! I hope he comes to save us.. because we'd be SH@#$ if he doesn't\" That's a ton of faith by the Justice League. Really..,, ? Batman had said.. \"Oh we need superman because the mother boxes became awakened because there was no superman\". The fate of the world depends on Superman.. and you don't even try knocking on his door so he can grab a ride with you to the biggest battle of the century??The movie of course has this awesome battle scene where Superman arrives in the nick of time. Superman easily takes on steppanwolf. He grabs ahold of steppanwolfs ax and blows on it (freezing it) and then hits it. Alas,.. seems like superman could just take care of everything. I'm sorry, but superman can't blow super super cold to the point he makes some advanced weapon breakable. It's just lame the way he disposed of the axe.. I guess this is how snyder does things. Just magically have things disappear.In the movies ending. Magically again... Clark is back. No explaination how. He's back working. Really? Didn't he get a heroes funeral in snyder movie 2 (batman vs superman).?Again.. the slow motion scenes were not done well at all.. moving between slow motion and fast motion. The gratuitous use of slow motion should be outlawed as well as the slow music that went with it.So again.. a 2 hour movie became a 4 hour movie. Yes, this is a great movie for fan's who don't really care about sensibility but just want to see more of what they lived and grew up with with non sensible story.At the end.. why didn't Darkseid just enter the portal and fight Justice League? You could see.. he had a gigantic army. Heck... why is darkseid just staying at home when the 3 mother boxes so IMPORTANT to his world domination is easily attainable in earth. Why send just 1. Just send 1 monster known as steppanwolf. Man.. Darkseid doesn't seem like he's that menacing if his big master plan was to send 1 bad mamma jamma. Seriously.. the movie was just one big boss and a bunch of alien flies? The mother boxes were SO IMPORTANT and the search for anti matter was SO IMPORTANT.. but I'll just send ONE GUY!!? Darkseid had a planet of army men.. but he only sent one guy and some alien flies?Batman's speech about how Darkseid hadn't met the likes of Justice League was abit laughable before they run out to the final battle.Anyways,.. DC lovers.. enjoy your film. I really hope Snyder doesn't touch Batman, Superman,.. or anything in the DC universe. If this movie had been released the way he wanted it.. it possibly would have been a bigger bomb. Why?A 4 hour film vs a 2 hour film would require DOUBLE the amount of people to achieve the revenue that was achieved with the Whedon cut. I HIGHLY doubt it would do that with a super long convoluted story. At the very least... Whedon tried to make the story explainable to those who aren't hardcore fans. This was what was missing.The international market in Asia does not care about DC fanservice. I know of cyborg but even I didn't care for the added hour of cyborg. He's boring character as depicted by snyder. Imagine non fan's spending time to watch added boring scenes. Also having to go through scenes that don't make any sense.The movie snyder made was not that great. What whedon did was make a bad movie consumable for the general public. What snyder did, was just make a movie that made a small group of super fans happy, but left a majority of people wondering, \"Why all the slo mo and bad music?\"", "4:3 Ratio!

It was worth the 4 year wait, and I'm glad that a 4 hour version of this film was released on a streaming service than in theaters. And I had an absolute blast with it. Despite being so dang long, I was never bored and I loved the more smoother, slower pace instead of the quick, rushed pacing that Josstice League had. The characterization was miles better, the cinematography was beautiful yet dark, matching the cerebral tone, and the humor was, to my liking, very subtle and not forced or chessy. I really enjoyed this version and I encourage Zack Snyder to make more movies because he's such an underrated director.And my rating is not an exaggeration.

Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman were all so much better and the depth into Cyborgs story and finally being able to see it was amazing. The villains were so much cooler and badass, just everything in this film was true to Zack and it couldn't be better. Junkie XLs score was mesmerising from start to finish. From signing a petition in 2017 to now being here and finally getting this film with everyone who's helped along the way is an immensely proud feeling.

I don't know why Warner bros even considered releasing the other version... this beats it in every facet.", "Same plot, more wasted time": "I don't understand people that give this extended version so much higher score than previous one. It's not awful, there are good fighting scenes, the effects are good, same as the previous one. But the final score for me is still 6.\nThe characters are better explained, there are more flashbacks and emotions but at the same time there's more time wasted on absolutely unnecessary things and the plot in general stays the same and is quite stupid.\nThere are also really irritating moments. For example every time wonder woman enters the view there's a couple of slow-motion seconds with her hair moved by the wind and the music changes to amazon theme. Literally every time, even if she's there for a second, even if there was no wind and the music was totally unrelated.\nSecond the usage of Flash. He's really badly used. Some other reviewers call it a goofball - I totally agree, but it's more. There's no single flash fighting scene with. And we know from X-Men movies how good can speedster scenes be done. But not here, here's his just a battery (not more explanations without spoiling), there are a ton of scenes where his speed could have been used beautifully, I even imagined it happening in the next second, but no, I guess Zack really hates flash and it was more important to make fun of him.\nTo Summarize, if you loved the previous one, definitely see this one as it will give more insight into characters and you'll love it even more. But if you hated the previous one, save 4 hours of your life for something better.", "Immensely better characters better movie": "This movie gave real life to the character of Victor and Flash. Many of the cringeworthy scenes have been taken out and the final battle was completely different. I am actually hyped for this universe. Very enjoyable.", "Great Movie! Such an improvement over what we got": "Fantastic movie. Much better than what we got. Much better character development. Only 3 things I didn't care for was the intro was long, the singing scene was long, and the epilogue chat didn't need to be so long. Otherwise they didn't de-power Wonderwoman, Aquaman got more backstory, Cyborg actually is relatable which adds an extra 2 points on its own, flash also got better development. Great movie. For 4 hours I was impressed that only so little I would change.

Whoever gave Superman and Batman to him needs to be fired immediately. He ruined both characters.Now, there were some good things about this movie. The villains were some of the coolest looking villains I've seen in any comic book movie. I also really liked Aquaman and Cyborg. Wonder Woman killed it as always. I liked The Flash, but he was incredibly unfunny.People are going to say, as I've already started to hear it, \"You just don't like it because you're a Marvel fan\". That has nothing to with it. I loved The Batman, Christian Bale's Batman movies, Christopher Reeve Superman movies, the new Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman. Also, this was supposed to be released because the original Justice League was worse? I don't even want to know what the first one was like.", "This is the the greatest superhero movie to date": "No contest. This is the best.

The cautionary tale of Justice League. Large studios need to heed the lesson.The epilogue is worth the watch on its own, the chemistry of the two actors and the almost perfect character dynamic between them. You will know what I mean when you see it.This is canon. WB needs to make the finale with Snyder. It would be the blockbuster they are looking for.", "Perfect CBM film!": "All I wanna say are 2 things, 1. ZSJL is the best CBM film of the history, 2. This movie is indescribably good.", "Instead of \"one ring to rule them all\" lamer and it's three boxes.": "I initially saw in color and gave this a 1....after Black & White and knowing what to Fast Forward I finished it in 2:45 and the film has the same weaknesses but significant improvement to action sequences that are CGI heavy and look pretty decent in monochromatic so bump it to a 2 lol.Not surprisingly it was just as bad as the color and the theatrical. ON THE PLUS SIDE THIS IS WATCHABLE COMPARED TO \"THE BATMAN\" ANOTHER WARNER BROTHER DC ASSASSINATION.YOU KILLED SUPERMAN TWICE AFTER 2000....destroy all TV DC after 1 or 2 seasons. Aquaman was good for kids you woke up Wonder-woman only to kill her with WW84... painfully bad. Ben Afleck enough said...\nWell Richard Donner made a good memorable Superman, Nolan's Trilogy was geared more to adults than Marvel and he nailed it. Otherwise take your kids and watch Batman 1966 or LEGO Batman.And for Bat Fans don't mention Burton those films stank to.I have to insist anyone giving this above a 3 is a die hard DC fan. Anything over a 7 and lengthy is on Warner Bros/HBO's payroll. Then there are 70% of 10 ratings that emphasize \"Bring Back the Snyderverse\" like Zack Snyder is such a huge part of the world he deserves a fictional noun. Simply put this was 2 extra hours to give darker feel, and clarification to a terrible original. Since the original was terrible why would one think that a two hour elaboration would make it better. It's basically the same film with dragged out battles...elaboration on a horrible animated villain. The Villain is the same, the free agent gathering of heroes still feels nothing like a team or league. There doesn't appear to be many non-hero humans involved or impacted by this alien threat to the world. No military, no terrified civilians. 4 hours of 3 very brooding males, a brooding cyborg, and a bored Blunder Woman. Additional brief cartoons of more scratchy voiced alien supervillains who give Stepenwolf a purpose (I think). Simply put only a true fanatic can push through this and then generously give it a 6. The reality is that even meta critic is generous in the 50s...\nI moved this g because in black and white I didn't mind letterbox, and it looked more like a live comic without migraines.The story, dialogue, lack of cast chemistry, plus the hype... I can't believe I'm saying it still worse than Batman vs Superman. Every Snyder DC film not only lacks what I mentioned but they are dumb and boring except The 300 films those were entertaining... some humor... ridiculous CGI violence... Penny Dreadful's nudity...This film should be used by the CIA instead of water-boarding.My first question is what do those boxes smell like? Is it a nice smell or rancid? Like if you know what it smells like you can make this movie even more ridiculous with a plan that Bruce Wayne spreads Chanel #5 in huge concentrations all over the globe till Superman gets his mind together after a few hours with that ginger Lois Lane ... needs a super release after sleeping in a coffin for 3 years... Why not keep that simple like a Lazarus pit... And is there any society because the only people I really see this entire 4 hours are the heroes and the cgi.... like where are the people freaking out? Where's the havoc? There are parademons flying all over the place? Is this all happening during the lockdown?Problem 1 cinematography:\nThe Problem is it's 2021 most TV owner's even if not at 4K are still on 1080p that are widescreen 1.78:1 or 2.35:1 aspect ratios not letterbox format please. I have a 55' 16:9 like most so for a 4 plus hour feature which requires special effects for this genre 1/3 of my screens width shouldn't be wasted.Problem 2 I'm aware there was much debate to present in color or black and white. With the aspect ratio black and white would have made sense and given it and \"old school\" feel. The CGI was so obvious as well that it may have looked less ridiculous in black and white. So Snyder goes normal coloring but compromised. It's as if it was filmed through polarized sunglasses so the color is distinguishable but it looks very dark. (Changing the setting to Dynamic doesn't make a significant difference- it's a \"dark film\" so it's filmed with a dark feel).So far we're presented with a R rated hero film now to me that means there has to be a sense of mockery and foul language (satire)... or really violent.... Think \"Deadpool\" or \"300\" (The 300 Snyder films significantly more entertaining than his three DC installments since \"The Personality of Steel\"\nTaking content and characters intended for children and making it targeted for adults is not an easy task. There's no violence here that doesn't clearly look animated.Steppenwolf's introduction like the original movie emanates from one of \"the boxes\" (shoot me with that stupid backstory; that is the story of the boxes and Darkside's only defeat!! Literally the boxes and Amazonian taunting with bad voice acting) on wonder woman's home island. There's been no attempt on making any improvement in terms of realism the graphics are obvious and cheap. There is nothing scary looking or intimidating about the CGI work or the raspy microphone echoing of Steppenwolf's voice. Compared to Marvel the CGI presentation is far inferior to that of Thanos or The Hulk.There's also no explanation at least at the point of his arrival as to why he had arrived or why he's arrived now. Did Luthor send a message or was it Superman's hibernation?It's an embarrassing beat down on the Amazonian breed of women... like the first film but longer. Even Wonder Woman's opening scene (totally unrelated to the story but more to generate interest in her debut movie) tossing the explosive was done like network TV CGI quality( for 70% of this film I felt like I was watching a horrid video game). This goes back to black and white would have been more suitable like it was in \"Sin City\".So in terms of the cinematography though my critique was formulated in 30 minutes I endured it throughout the remainder of this bombastic chaotic 3 hour and 50 minute gut wrenching nightmare, with three additional endings for bad sequels.Casting issue: I felt very strongly about this when Batman vs Superman was released as well as the \"Definitive Cut\" Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor not only a poor physical choice based on cartoons and comics... but he is more reminiscent of Jim Carry's Batman Forever riddler with spots and a higher level of ADD. He doesn't come off as narcissistic and sinister, but as a spoiled bitter brat with resources. Not the over confident intellectual with a well planed and calculated sinister plot. He also has nothing to do with the film it's exactly what you saw in the previews as a possible sequel prelude.Ben Afleck... after Christian Bale, Ben Afleck regardless of his personal conditioning, doesn't do Bruce Wayne well at all. He's Batman in and out of the costume. His \"darkness\" isn't convincing either with his puffy cheeks and heavily cleft chin. Like Suicide Squad Lito was a futile pointless 5 minutes with Afleck dropping the one F bomb to earn the R rating. (Unless the R was for a warning.. like restricted to fanatics and people with no taste in entertainment).The movie has a different feel after seeing Aquaman (though this takes place before his solo film). And after the first Wonder Woman. If one is choosing Cyborg over the Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter - who also makes a pointless appearance in case of a sequel...(Though I have no understanding as to why) He needs a movie as does the Flash (sorry Arrowverse TV doesn't cut a Flash intro for film).So though the back story for Flash and Cyborg is given extra time briefly and the Flash saves Iris, Iris has no lines or contribution in this film another trailer tease.. the time wasted is not sufficient enough to justify watching \"Justice League\". But\nThe last 90-100 minutes was all bad CGI fighting scene and gave me a headache. There was barely any dialogue outside of Steppenwolf trash talking Amazonians.I still want to know why there's a R rating?Is it the \"F-word\" by Batman in the three extra pointless scenes that point toward sequels ? With the utter lack of chemistry between these heroes the worst idea would be to unite them again, in any dimension or multiverse... What do I care about an alternate Multiverse with Jared Leto talking about the death off Todd and I assume temporarily working with apocalyptic Batman ,Cyborg and Queen Atlantis against Bizzaro Superman or evil Superman? And why would anyone care that Luthor managed to get out of Arkham and reveal to death stroke that Batman is Bruce Wayne? What do these endings have to do with a Flashpoint paradox for going into the past? Why not go back to the end of Superman vs Batman and prevent the fight so they kill Doomsday without sacrifice ergo no Steppenwolf? If the Kryptonian was preventing the Boxes from calling out to Darkside what prevented them the 4965 years before the Kryptonian arrived on Earth?The story was just as bad and twice the length. It still was 90% the actors were wearing a green outfit and wires and there was no time for a true \"League\" to form because they don't know each other and the only one who attempted to form cohesion was Flash. It was all business in eliminating the CGI monstrosity and preventing the arrival of Darkside. I'm being magnanimous with a 2.", "Indescribably epic": "Marvel Movies are Rock'n Roll, Jokes and Popcorn, even if someone dies, you're not really sad and wait until someone cracks a joke so you're finally allowed to laugh again and open that bottle of beer.\nBut this is just so different. The heroes get depicted as the fearsome and tragic gods of earth they truly are. Amongst them, a human, Bruce Wayne, struggling to keep up with the help of his intellect, wealth and technology, to guide those gods and maintain order a world of chaos. And they need to unite and prepare for war against the gods of the gods.\nYou can feel it, you want to believe it. Awestricken 4 hours. Even if you hated the thatrical cut, give this one a chance and just forget the old one. I didn't have any expectations and assumed I would stop watching after 30 minutes, that's how pessimistic I was. I know how cheesy that sounds, and that is because we are used to cheesy and corny superhero movies, but just do it. The pace is different, the story is complete and coherent, the CGI is so much better. The music, the voices, the color palette, the narration, it is unbelievable how all that makes such a huge difference, it feels like a different movie and keeps you wondering what it was, what you saw (and already forgot) three years ago.", "Another superhero movie.": "Not much has changed since Whedon perspective of Justice League. I can't tell what was good in this version, but i can say what was bad in a few lines from my point of view.\n1. The worst CGI i have seen in years.\n2.Too much slow motion, and i don t know why.\n3. Aquaman was just for the big picture, the character didn't find he's role in the movie, he's just there for a few \"comic\" lines.\n4.The action si way to slow in the first 2-3 hours and then change very fast. This is disturbing.\n5.Like the first version the acting is not to good.This are my thoughts, i don't want to upset anyone. If you have 4 hours free of your time and some beer would be a \"ok\" choice for a movie. If you don't, don't waste your time.", "They said it wouldn't happen": "Well it did. It was pretty good but it wasn't perfect. The cons: the cg wasn't as good because of the small budget. The story was a bit dim in some areas. The acting was pretty good and so was the action. The movie didn't even seem like 4 hours it seemed shorter. I wanted the knightmare sequence to be a bit longer but it was fine the way it was. Overall it is a solid movie and you should check it out.", "WISHING FOR MORE": "I have just collected my thoughts and I am still shocked of what Zack has created. Comic book movie like no other, wishing for more and more. This heroes deserve a justice and they have one. How can anyone create a monster of a movie in 2017 and deprive us from this great spectacle?! Coherent, funny, plenty of action and most of all spectacular. Your senses will be attacked with awesomeness just like Zack can deliver.\nJust watch it and I promise you will enjoy every single second.\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Mastapiece": "I love how flash did nothing for three hours then broke the speed of light. The new aspect ratio and gray colors really made this worth the extra two hours, thank you Zack Snyder for saving DC and showing joss whedon he's an idiot. Jared Leto was breathtaking made the whole movie worth it", "Best cinecomic ever made..": "Yes of course it's a great treat for the true DC fans and it also leaves normal cine lovers to drop their jaws at many moment.", "Best NEW blockbuster of 2020": "This is a totally different movie from the incoherent mess of the previous version. Its like Barry Allen used the speed force to go back in time to correct Whedon's mistake. I understand people compare DC and Marvel films but this particular Snyder version just has a different but absolutely spell-binding vibe about it.\nThe only downside was Darkseid's appearance that was not menacing enough.\nCyborg was the standout hero for me and I always wondered why he looked so pissed off in the Whedon version but now that I know his motivations, everything makes so much more sense", "Hell of a movie": "Amazing compared to the first. This is the justice league movie we deserved right from the start!", "Exceedingly flawed": "While in some respects this improves on the 2017 version in that it gives some backstory to characters not previously introduced into the DC universe it also introduces massive new problems of it own making.The mess of the Whedon cut which was based on studio demands to cut a 4 hour monstrosity down to 2 hours and create a universe that probably needed 2 more intro films was poor, but here it has been replaced with the entire 4 hour monstrosity And that still needed at least 1 more intro film.Editing, there is none. Snyder seems to have just poured his vision onto the screen complete with no regard to keeping the story moving forward in a tight and dynamic way. If you removed the excessive use of slow motion and meaningless scenes of the league walking up stairs and the like you could have probably trimmed at least 30 minutes off the bloat.CGI and Soundtrack are choppy at best ranging from poor and out of place to strange which for a film which has had so much cash thrown at it is bizzare. The very long scene of the fishing ladies singing off Aquaman might as well have been from the twilight zone.Biggest problems though come from world breaking plot issues. I'll use Flash as a example.Firstly when you have someone that can move at near the speed of light in the Flash he could have cleared the entire battlefield excluding Steppenwolf inside 10 seconds once inside the dome. Travelling at near speed of light the laser blast that struck Flash would have been moving at a snail pace and thus been easy to avoid. Flash talks about not going above the speed of light then appears to have almost perfect control or is amazingly lucky when using this ability. If Flash had to be be building up to near light speed why do it in range of the the dome when it would have taken basically zero time to travel any distance to the boxes.Snyder also does not keep continuity with the universes established in the WW and Aquaman films.There a large number of other plot holes and criticisms that i have not included but for people to be claiming this as a masterpiece or the best superhero film ever is just delusional. I give it a 2 only because Snyder was attempting to do the work of multiple films in one so i grant him so leeway.", "\"One of the best of the best\"": "Three things this film has proven: 1) It will take no solo films but only a four-hour tale to establish connection and affinity with the League and even the antagonists-all thanks to the outstanding storytelling; 2) never underestimate the power of fandoms; it is so formidable it can unearth mysteries and glory; 3) DC remains the home of \"the world's greatest superheroes\". This work of art is a huge triumph-for the fans and for the history of cinema.", "ZACK SNYDER TAKE A BOW": "As a fan of previous dc films who was disappointed by man of steel, batman vs superman and hated the original release of justice league. Im pleased to say this made up for it all. All the characters developed, villains as well. Better action scenes which felt more real than most superhero cgicentric fights. Batman doesnt feel like a passenger in this cut which was one of my biggest frustrations previously. Again Zack Snyder take a bow", "It only took 10 minutes....": "To know that this is the film it always should have been, brilliantly edited, added to and re imagined. Now up there with \"Man of Steel\" as the best DC film.", "A Very Stylish Power Rangers Movie": "Ok so first this movie doesn't deserve 1. I'd say it's a solid 7/7.5 but because of irrational DC fans who massively gave it a 10 I had to change my rating.\nI really liked Zach Snyder's Man Of Steel but hated B v S and obviously hated 2017's Justice League. Zach Snyder has an unique style and a great talent for atmosphere and settings. Some of the visuals of his Justice League are beautiful and inspired. I particularly loved the flashback God's battle.But truth is he really doesn't know how to use those massive characters. Problem comes from Warner Bros. He has to create whole back stories for 3 new main characters which was impossible in a 2 hours movie. The best of this version are the developments on Flash & Cyborg. They are real emotional characters and that's kind of rare for the DCEU at this point. Aquaman is greatly cast as we already knew and Superman keeps being the great character he was in Man Of Steel, his godlike entity perfectly used.Then the problem is that Wonder Woman & Batman have extremely poor storylines. Their interactions are artificial, forced and they seem to be glorified cameos in their own movie.\nThis shows that as talented Zach Snyder is he can't make up for a weak script.The whole story seems to come from a Power Rangers episode or actually a Power Rangers toy commercial, seriously! Aliens want boxes (insert action scene), group of heroes come together (action action), aliens get magic boxes with mandatory science lab scenes then group of heroes get new vehicule (by the way that Bat-crab-thing is ridiculously slow and useless) and attack alien base on Earth.I mean it looks great for sure but wow that's very basic. And then you get 20 minutes of Easter eggs, cameos & set up of potential future sequel... hum... Shame because it's the first time I resonate with DC characters that much.", "Not much of a difference to me": "I've tried despite being put off with the length of the movie and... I had to watch it in 6 goes! Just couldn't sit through it in one go. Still boring, doesn't feel like it's connected with anything, especially the characters who don't even look or act like a team. Slow motion was the most annoying pain, Ezra too cause he's just a had Flash.Everything seemed rushed, like there was no plan for it at all - ironic though as they had plenty of time to make it the bestest movie ever, not many movies get two versions after all. Still very very very average though.", "The last 45 minutes (out of 4 hours) are decent": "When Zach Snyder was filming JUSTICE LEAGUE in 2016, a tragedy occurred in his family and he was forced to drop out and the job of Directing that film went to Joss Whedon (THE AVENGERS). This version of the film was met by many (including me) with a collective \"meh\", it was an unintelligible mess of a movie that paid lip service to fan boys (maybe) and gave very little to anyone not well versed in all things DC Comics. Many, many fans assumed that there was much left on the cutting room floor (or not filmed at all) that would correct the many mistakes of this film.After a large outcry to \"Restore The Snyder Cut\", Warner Brothers and HBO Max gave the fans what they wanted - a 4 hour redone version of this film that was intended to clear up the many, many confusing moments of the first film.And that is EXACTLY what has happened. Zach Snyder has created a film that is very long on explanation and exposition - exactly what the fanboys wanted. What it didn't do was to clear up the mess that is the plot, pacing and characters of this film.ZACH SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE unites many of the great SuperHeroes of DC Comics - Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) - to fight an intergalactic villain.So..how many of those heroes are you anxious to see on screen together and really dive deep into their backstories and motivations? If you said The Flash and Cyborg - then this is the film for you for Snyder really delves deeply into these 2 characters.Unfortunately, what this has done is to push the heroes that the \"average Joe\" knows and loves - Batman, WonderWoman and Aquaman - to the background and, most damning of all, relinquished Superman to an extended cameo. He also throws almost every DC Character that has appeared in a previous film in - most really quickly. So, thanks for stopping by the party Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Commissioner Gordon (J. K. Simmons), Vulko (Willem Dafoe), Lex Luther (Jesse Eisenberg), Alfred (Jeremy Irons), Martha Kent (Diane Lane), Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and Mira (Amber Heard). If I blinked I would have missed you.To be fair, the last 45 minutes of this film are really interesting (including an Epilogue that sets up a sequel that we'll never see), but in order to get there, you need to slog through 3 hours and 15 minutes of this disjointed film.Worth the effort for the \"Fanboys\" and \"Hardcores\", not worth the effort for the \"Average Joe\".Letter Grade: B (I really, really liked the Epilogue)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)", "Snyder's Justice League rescues the entire DC franchise": "I loved this movie, and compared to the Whedon version, it's like it's from another planet. Face it, not many people cared about the DC universe prior to this, and the franchise was withering. Wonder Woman 1984 was a bomb, the world is fairly indifferent to the recent Superman films (or they dislike them), Aquaman was preposterously bad, and we have a new Batman in the works with Robert Pattinson. I do think Pattinson will make an excellent and dark Batman, by the way, he's a fabulous actor, but honestly the entire DC franchise was dying, and it has become a Marvel world.Snyder's Justice League has rebooted the entire franchise. It was a pleasure to watch all 4 hours uninterrupted, and it left me looking forward to more Justice League films. It's that simple. And I'm not even a comic book guy. Loved it.", "Dark Snyder...wow!": "Zack Snyder always makes gloomy dark movies and this can be seen in all his films. But \"300\" was a cult model of how to make such a movie and made it back in 2006. Back then, Marvel hairdressers never dreamed of this style.

However, it is to full of its own importance, is insufferably dull and the many, many CGI fights are confused, confusing and follow the same basic pattern. Mixed in with an incredibly slow first 90 minutes, the ridiculously long epilogue, and the rather unsympathetic characters, this is a very disappointing film.", "Really long, boring, tasteless": "If you didn't like the other Snyder DC movies, you'll hate this one. It's a four hour long torture tour of sadness. It's boring. You like DC comics? This movie ain't for you. Is Batman vs Superman your favourite movie? This was made specifically for you. I wasn't a fan of Batman bs Superman. This movie was the bane of my existence. God help mankind if this is considered a \"good\" movie. Honestly expected to see more bad reviews", "OUTSTANDING!": "Yesterday I watched Man of Steel, Batman VS Superman, Justice League and Zack Snyder's Justice League.Zack Snyder's Justice League is hands down THE BEST superhero movie I have ever seen! I collect superhero movies.\nThe 4 hr 2 minute play time is broken up by parts. At each part, I paused it and did what I needed to do, giving me time to absorb what I saw.After seeing this film it makes me wonder how much better many big budget movies could have been. The theatrical version is an example of how studios and some producers create a work which is designed to appeal to the widest possible audience in an effort to appeal to basic societal expectation. Focusing more on the marketing pay-off than telling an engaging story.This film was a creation of art and mood. Geared more towards a select few. Its not a film which tries to make you feel good and more about the view and mood of the essence of the ideas being presented. Its very effective at its job of suspending disbelief.The redesigned look and feel is amazing with its attention to detail. Important details absent in the original release in 2017. Snyder's vision shows us a good movie can be made when the studios actually allow the art to override the money potential.Granted, much of the effects were CGI but the CGI was well done and added to the quality of the film.\nI read there were still parts of Zack Snyder's cut which did not make the screen. I also read there is a black & white version which shows a different ending and lil segments left out of this version. I'd love to see that too.Last night, after it finished, I decided to make this version a permanent film in my DC Justice League Universe collection. It blows away Marvel's Cinematic Universe.Will Zack Snyder make Justice League 2? Will he remake Man of Steel or Dawn of Justice? Will he make The Flash?\nI feel like I've been cheated by all the previous superhero films. It exemplifies the feeling of \"Here is what is possible and 'this' is what 'we decided' to give you\".Zack Snyder RAISED the bar. Not an inch, a mile!

Been his fan since The Man of Steel.", "Why'd They Even Bother to Release the First One?!": "This movie was simply incredible, hundreds of times better than the theatrical release. Sure, it was 4 hours long, but that gave time to adequately develop the characters (even the villains), build the story, and set the stage for upcoming sequels. Plus they removed a lot of the silly scenes from the first release, which didn't belong in an epic of this caliber. This is how movies should be made.", "Perfect and Brilliant by Zack Snyder!!!": "He got another chance and man did he deliver!!! Zack Snyder's Justice League is epic in every way and it's amazing the difference it makes to the same core story at the hand of a Director who takes these characters seriously!!!!

The movie is way to long with too much off well everything.

This movie is a bore.", "Finally The Day Has Come!": "Snyder's cut of \"Justice League\" is a different beast altogether. From its gripping visuals to dynamic score, finer character build-ups to reinforced writing; in entirety this is undeniably a substantial upgrade! I might as well say, this should be deemed as one of the very best coming from DCEU thus far!\"I know we're all thinking the same thing right now. Who's gonna say it? I'm not gonna say it.\"Back in 2017, when 'Josstice League' (as people mockingly cite Joss Whedon's rendition) came out; fans were infuriated! Especially hardcore DC fanatics. They had demonstrated their displeasure all over social media. As #ReleaseTheSnyderCut starts to catch fire, and things were slowly but steadily getting out of hand; Warner Bros. had no other choice but to Reassess the unpleasant situation. Almost four years later, they finally decided to Re-Release the Project. Except now Zack Snyder is behind the wheel.And I'm sure fans couldn't have asked for more!This is an enormous improvement in each constituent as compared to the last outing! Characters seem to have way more depth. Albeit the pacing passes through perceptible inertia halfway but owing to adequate screentime that has been allocated to both protagonists and the antagonists here; we could clearly figure out their personal motives and purposes.For instance, Cyborg aka Victor being the ideal template for exhibiting what significance apt characterization truly bears! Contrary to the earlier draft, this time around he has a well-rounded character arc. Thanks to that we genuinely start caring. Something similar happened with Flash aka Barry! Besides his habitual comedic persona; he's been also given a key role.In respect to the Technical aspects, there are not enough words to express my gratitude. Quite a show this has been in terms of CGI and Visual Effects. Thomas Holkenborg's mastery in the Background Score took my experience to the next level. Epicness written all over it!Taking everything into account, whilst I'm pretty confident that vast majority of the audience would welcome this version yet there is a possibility it may raise contrastive viewpoints regarding the extensive length.Trust Me On This, You Won't Be Disappointed!", "BEST ACTION SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!! \ud83d\udcaf": "Actually the best action superhero movie ever. Not a single second out of 4 hours and 2 minutes felt like wasted. A must watch movie for DC FANS. The BGM was fantabulous and out ot the world. The last scenes where bruce dreams of teaming up with super villains like joker, deathstroke along with other heroes to fight against Superman. That was tooooooo much thrilling. We should get the restored snyderverse. It is needed for all of us!!", "Holy S#$@ Batman! Whoa!!": "I have to thank Zack Synder for a created mind he has for literally doing the movie right of the way it should be...omg...it was soo loonngg but worth it...no spoilers here, just watch..fully explained in details with each character in the movie. Throw the other one in the trash folks! Buy this one with the rest of the collection..kudos!!", "Far better than the Whedon cut": "This cut was drastically better than Whedon's, but still has plenty of issues. The inclusion of Darkseid, the makeover on Steppenwolf, and the added development of Cyborg and Flash were all very welcome changes. However, this film still suffers from the absolute trainwreck of a universe that is the DCEU. We don't really have any backstory for a lot of these characters so this all feels rushed. I hope one day the DCEU churns out quality content like the MCU has been all along, and while this is a step in there right direction, they're just not quite there yet.", "So far away from The Avengers": "-5 stars for script, 7 stars for CGI, 2 for Amy Adams, so it comes 4 stars.If u're not a DC fan, please think twice before watching this, you might punch your tv.This 4 hrs of CGI footages is exactly what u see on the big screen at a night club, loads of contents but not much related.", "Amazing Direction by Genius Zack": "Perfect Superhero Movie. Barry & Victor finally got their due credit. This is movie seriously the best thing I saw in 2021", "Nearly as bad as the last one.": "Awful film with fantastic marketing. If you had read Twitter in the weeks/months leading up to this, you would've thought you were getting a 10/10 movie and DC movies would be back at the level of the Nolan films, but in reality it's no better than the last one.", "Just amazing.": "It's an incredible movie, i really love this movie and all the emotions that it makes me feel.", "how can this not be canon???": "Can someone explain to me how this cant be canon? because the theatrical version was C R A P and we ALL know it. Snyders version was amazing, it had depth and spirit while the theatrical version was something like a Michael Bay movie but even worse. I hope warner bros realise that no one will consider the theatrical version a canon, because it stinks, its horrible.", "This is a great movie": "Im not saying the film has no flaws but it will definitely engage you and bring your last moments to your heart.", "Great special effects": "But unfortunately a lot of slow boring corny love story which if I wanted to watch I'd watch a romantic comedy not a sci-fi film.Cyborg: Terrible character no personality\nFlash: moves so fast it's slow motion. Also not funny.Batman: Affleck with his mask on looks overweight it's bizarre\nAquaman: wet fishGood special effects though and an improvement on the first one.", "SNYDERS MOST IMPRESSIVE WORK YET": "This movie is long but the greatest reel work of art ever done. Zack Snyder brings his beautiful art of Storytelling to the Superhero Genre in a way nobody would have thought possible.\nSure enough the I's are dotted and the T's crossed (he is a consummate professional after all), but what stands out is the detailing which never once detracts from the story.\nEach character arc is beautifully crafted. Victor Stone is the prime example, it's no fibbing that Cyborg is the heart of this movie.\nThe big bads look terrible and imposing.\nSo many story arcs woven into one epic tale can sometimes become a mess. Not so with the newest rendition of the JLA.\nIt's a Superhero version of Lord of the Rings and its astounding in its scale, brilliance and sheer ability to touch you emotionally.\nYes there's violence, it's Zack Snyder after all. The action is brilliant, the CGI be it a slo mo of a battle or the appearance of New God Darkseid is just amazing.\nEven the villains motivations and characters are etched out brilliantly.\nThe musical score is an absolute winner and blends perfectly with the visuals.\nThis is not a half baked rushed effort by a last minute replacement.\nThis is Zack Snyders Justice league and the greatest Superhero movie yet.Zack Snyder and Warner Brothers nigh on went to war during the initial shooting of Justice League. Sadly Autumn Snyders (God bless her soul) broke him and he gave up the fight for a little while. We the fans of Zack petitioned, mocked, insulted and fought to have his original vision restored for at least one movie #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.\nIt's personal for him and you can see it in every frame.\nWell done Zack. She'd be proud of you.", "A Child dream come true!": "After reading comics, watching animated series, watching movies that adapted DC Comics characters successfully at times and disastrously at others, since my childhood always prevailed a dream and that dream was to see all these characters together in a movie fighting a threat that forced them to work as a team. I thought that dream had come true in 2017, today I realized that dream had been postponed for almost 4 years, today I saw the movie I had dreamed of seeing all my life, today I saw Cyborg fight his inner demons and understand what a force for good he is, today I saw in Flash that funny and endearing character showing his potential, today I saw Wonder Woman living up to her name, today I saw Aquaman shutting the mouths of those who said he was a ridiculous character, today I saw Batman being that leader who always has a plan, today I saw Superman more solemn and powerful than ever, and above all I saw the Justice League being formed!\nI laughed, I screamed, I got excited, I cried.... Today I finally saw the superhero movie I dreamed of since I was a kid and even knowing that opinions are subjective, I firmly say that this movie destroys the first Avengers movie in every aspect!Zack Snyder ratifies his love for these characters and brings us an unforgettable epic in terms of plot, visual and sound!The cinematography is a delight.\nThe action scenes are breathtaking.\nThe soundtrack composed by Junkie XL is an absolute beast!Simply.... COLOSSAL!Thank you Zack Snyder!To finish Junkie XL you just did something that seemed impossible to me, and that was to improve the theme \"Flight\" by Hanz Zimmer, you just created a new immortal theme for #Superman, I cried like a child in that scene and when that theme played!Today more than ever!#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "The best superhero movie of all time": "This movie had it all. It brought what fans wanted to the big screen. I can believe wb did what they did to Snyder. They are the reason why probably won't get to finish this amazing story. I have waited for years to get a good dc universe and Snyder was well on his way to it. It would have destroyed marvel in the end. Unfortunately wb hired gunn to make another failed attempt of bringing dc to life. There will never be anything close to this. End game and infinity war was great, but not as great as this. I have all but lost hope for dc and their future. I guess I'll be watching marvel only from now on.", "WB must green light JL2 at least": "Obviously I liked it, and liked it more the second time.\nThe ending however is absolutely mind blowing and lets so much to be desired.\nWB must green light the 2nd and give Snyder full creative control of it.", "Shows just how the DCEU can surpass MCU": "This is an epic film on all levels and matches, if not exceeds Avengers Infinity War.It's literally a different movie to the original theatrical version. I can't understand how Whedon could make such a terrible and boorish movie out of what he had to work with except that he went out of his way to sabotage it.A must watch for this year.", "Zack Snyder wins the bet": "Because of the chaos that pervaded the DC world, I hated all DC movies except for the Dark Knight trilogy, But now my opinion has changed because of this movie. Zach Snyder had a clear vision of what he wanted to do, We clearly see in this film building strong foundations for a world that makes you as a viewer longing for future films, Personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot from the beginning until the end, which made me excited and search for future works for the DC world.\nThe film is strong in all aspects, appropriate drama and comedy in its editor and legendary action scenes, and the characters are a wonderful masterpiece that makes you relate to them all without exception\nThanks DC Thank you Snyder", "It wasn't great, it was good. It was definitely an improvement!": "Well...you all probably know the good things....I'm here to tell you what's not good.\n: To start with, way too much use of slow-mo......sometimes its tedious to watch.\n: Extreme use of background music which at times doesn't match with the ongoing scene and ruins it completely.\n: The overall CGI is good, but sometimes it looks very videogame-ish (particularly during darkseid's fight sequence with the old-age heroes, steppenwolf's eyes which are way to shiny and bright and doesn't match with his serious face).\n: It has 2+ hours of UNSEEN FOOTAGE!!?????..... where was it???....And even if it was there, it adds very little to the original story.\n: As it is a VERY big movie.....it is pretty boring at times...especially during the scenes from 2017's JL.All and all, it's good. It was overhyped way too much but is definitely better than the whedon's cut.\nIf you are a snyder fan, it is heaven for you. If you are a superhero fan, it is overall pretty good for you", "Some of it remains silly, but it sets a good precedent for auteurism": "I never wholly opposed the idea of the Snyder Cut. The 2017 Justice League film -- a patchwork of incompatible visions -- was discernably silly even without the Whedon reshoots, but it was also obvious that the theatrical cut was incomplete; that Zack Snyder was unable to make the movie he truly wanted.Now, thanks to fan support and HBO Max, he's gotten to finish his version and I've honestly missed having to deal with his fanboys; to be told that those who disliked the film where Batman throws a sink at Superman (and Lex Luthor pisses in a jar as a plot point) just weren't smart enough to get that all the references to religion were, in fact, references to religion. They were close to at least winning the argument that ZSJL was close to completion and ready to drop, which must be why he needed the budget of an entire blockbuster to make it and even shot new material with everyone's favorite Joker, Jared Leto (making up for his lost tattoos with edgy Jesus imagery and unironic \"We live in a society...\" rants for the ads), and everyone's favorite counterpoint to the \"believe all women\" mantra, Amber Heard.But even we non-fanboys can appreciate when superhero media permits auteurism. And even if the film is still goofy -- despite Snyder taking a leaf out of his zealots' book and declaring (after being mildly critiqued by Scott Mendelson on Twitter) that his cut of the story where people in super suits fight a cartoon space monster is actually \"for grownups\" -- his is more tonally consistent, fleshed out, and stylistically distinct than the theatrical cut. 2017 was way too early for this crossover.It certainly isn't as disjointed as its first iteration, nor as incoherent as BvS. On the flip side, it's much less colorful in this cut, but that's part of what makes it \"pure, undoctored Snyder\". It wouldn't be the same without the murkiness that cloaks the goofiness of Ben Affleck's costume. If only Steppenwolf's stapler suit was done the same favors.I might seem dismissive of the idea that comic-book superheroes are shaping up to be modern equivalents to Greek myths and Biblical figures or whatever (Twitter fanboys think mindless consumption is the same as reading Homer and even Matt Zoller Seitz compared ZSJL to Intolerance and S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3). This is absolutely an interesting thing to discuss, but I'm sad to inform Snyder aficionados that he hasn't made a unique observation, nor is having a high-pitched Luthor rave about gods and monsters an especially profound way of communicating it (if Snyder even cares about that, when it comes to \"more mature\" comic-books, which is hard to glean from the interviews where he mainly seems fascinated with the idea of having Batman say \"f-ck\").The Snyder Cut isn't without subtlety or artistry, but if it took you a while to figure out, that's on you.", "Wow totally different movie": "I don't even know where to begin. Who in their right mind thought the 2017 version is what fans wanted? The Snyder cut is exactly what we wanted. If you are a DC fan I think you will find that the Snyder cut Redeems the Justice league in the DC universe.", "Wow.... simply awesome": "This movie gave importance to it's each character and building their storyline...not unlike the previous JL...Zack Snyder just showed how a superhero movie is made... fantastic...loved it", "I feel like crying of joy": "Complete satisfaction.

It's a miracle that the MCU came first, cause that movie is full of cringe.Snyder's DCEU as a reviewer said is so good because if you pause any certain scene it is so epic it looks like a graphic novel, and to a comic book reader like me this feels fantastic and I think it does to all the people who pushed for the Snyder cut and liked it. And you know these 1 star reviewers have absolutely no taste as in most of the reviews they are pushing for the monsterverse to become a thing. All I can say with no bias whatsoever is that except for the first Godzilla movie, all others have been epic pieces of horse excrement.Also prepare for the coming of Jar Jar and Coats and the new superman Cal-vin El-is, get it soo smart I can't even.", "Thank you, Zack.": "After 4 years of complete disappointment with the first film, I've finally watched a Justice League film worthy of using that name.

The hype was so real . Zack snyder did it. He made a brilliant movie and used the cast nicely with some great scenes and what can I say about the entry of darkseid . It was the scene fans like me want to see from so long. We just need a snyder cut 2 and 3 but it's sad that we're not getting what we want. Stephen wolf upgrade was so sick but ending could've been better . They made him look so weak . But nonetheless Dc proved again why they're Og in comic world. Let's hope that we gonna get snyder cut 2 soon. Btw loved the Leto cameo . He is superb but hate for him is too much.", "The Real Justice League": "This is a masterpiece. I wish there is sequel to it. But this Justice League is a straight great piece of cinematic experience for me. Goosebumps were part of my moments in this movie! Gotta love Mr.Snyder for this!", "MCU is for kids": "This is what happens when the creator has the freedom to create and produce his own history. This movie is better than 87% of MCU storyline (full of stupid jokes and nonsense) in action, fights, character development, Snyder look just feels like a work of art, soundtrack and it just feels more epic.", "Like deja vu over and over and over again": "OK, it was better than the previous version but was it because they had incorporated many more ideas from the MCU? Because that's what it looked like to me, especially the flash scene. The baddy had also become much more Thanos like - both baddies in fact, but despite all of that, the characters shallower, the plot thinner and it just lacks the panache, the entertainment value and the humour that the mcu have displayed over the last decade. So, sure it was better than the previous version, but that still doesn't make it great.", "Far Better than 2017 Justice League": "This movie feels complete comparing to the Joss Whedon's Cut.

Snyder's four hour epic isn't perfect. It's unevenly paced (the should've went the Marvel route and introduced these characters beforehand), the score is a significant downgrade from Man of Steel and Batman v Superman and at times a little obnoxious, the jokes are cringy, some scenes go on for too long (I don't think the movie needed to be four hours long), but it tells a very engaging story, the action scenes are terrific, and it will not bore you. The characters are much more fleshed out here than the were in the original release, particularly Cyborg and the Flash, and there is a lot more meat put on Steppenwolf's bones. Darkseid's scenes, while few in number, completely won me over. I can't believe Warner Brothers simply removed him from the theatrical cut entirely. Not only was he set to be the main villain of the DCEU going forward, but he's the core of Steppenwolf's motivation in this movie. The character makes so much more sense to me now. And I don't know whose idea it was to replace Darkseid with Steppenwolf in the flashback, but it was a terrible one. Actually, chopping this movie down to two hours and replacing most of what's left with footage from a different director was a terrible idea. Warner Brothers should really stop screwing Zack over. First they forced him to cut 30 minutes from Batman v Superman, making it an incoherent mess, then they completely gutted this great movie. It shows WB really has no clue what to do with their DC properties. There's no possible way they watched Joss' film and thought it was an improvement. The Snyder cut made me feel like what happened actually mattered, whereas before I could not care less. The ending will leave you dying for an Injustice film, and the only way to get that is to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE.", "Justice for Justice League": "I never thought I'd see the day where I got done watching a DCEU flick, let alone a 4 hour long one, and was left genuinely excited to see more. How the people who were responsible for the last hunk of dog turds we got back in 2017 hold the positions they hold is beyond me but this movie took what I considered the worst comic book movie ever made and turned it into one of the most dark, fun and epic films I've ever seen.", "This movie is gem.": "Dc only need to just continue the story with all characters just go with the flow..\nI really loved it .. this is all we wanted from a movie.. this is mind blowing movies.. .

There's a difference between marvel and DC, DC doesn't much rely on humor, the characters are god like powerhouses and does compliment the superhero tag attached to their names.\nZack snyder had perfectly captured the very essence of DC universe in it.\nI couldn't thank him enough for completing this project and presenting it to DC fans, although I shouldn't compare this to other movie franchise, but it was more epic than the end game, I wish warner bros would have release this version of justice league instead of the trash we've been served in 2017.\nFight choreography was amazing, ben Affleck was just perfect as batman, i hope to see him in future projects, all the star cast did justice to their respective character and were essential for the storyline, The new god darkseid was menacing and was well represented as a evil God trying to get hold of the world.\nI was watching it with a teary eyes, that's how much epic the movie actually is, it's a delight for DC fans and also for superhero movie buffs, who grew up watching DC animations.\nThere were few scenes, in which all the super characters were interacting with each other, which felt similar to the way they used to interact in the animated version of justice league, which is actually amazing.I hope warner bros complete the entire trilogy and let Zack snyder direct & complete his 3 movie arch.It was Splendid!", "This Is A Truly Masterpiece.

Cyborg brought so much heart to the movie.", "Much Better But Not As Amazing As Fans Think": "\"I don't care how many demons he's fought in how many hells. He's never fought us. Not us united.\"The synopsis for Zach Snyder's Justice League still stays the same. Determined to ensure Superman's ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne aligns forces with Diana Prince with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. Now with this recut version of what Snyder intended, the movie plans to brings justice (not pun intended) to Justice League and the DCEU as a whole. For those who don't know, Zach Snyder had to step away while directing Justice League (2017) due to a family tragedy. To ensure the project could still go as planned, Joss Whedon took over around halfway through. Well, Whedon basically changed most of what Snyder intended and we got a pile of garbage that basically ruined all hope for the DCEU after so many failed projects. Fans were very upset by this and had asked for Snyder's version for a few years now. And we finally got it. I have to say I'm not a fan of the DCEU, only liking Wonder Woman, so I didn't care too much to see this ASAP. Plus with the 4 hour runtime that takes up a lot of time. After three sessions, I finished it a few days ago. I don't think it's as brilliant as many fans think, but I will say it's much better than most of the other movies.The script for this is more fleshed out. We get much better characters and a better understanding of the story. A highlight comes from Cyborg who had nothing known about him in Justice League. Though not my favorite character, I at least understood him now. I can't say the antagonist Darkseid is much better than other villains. He reminds me of a darker version of Thanos with a suit that made me feel uncomfortable in a good way. He wants to get the Mother Box which makes sense, but any other developments didn't make him any more deep in my opinion. The rest of the characters are all fine. With the long runtime, there's plenty of time to get more out of it.The runtime is my biggest issue. Usually with a cut, the runtime is used to further plot and have other stories included for character development. That is all in here, but it feels like some of this is just to get literally all the footage they had included. The best cut that I can use as an example is The Lord of the Rings. I don't know anyone who won't watch the extended cut. In fact, that's become the standard because of what it accomplished. There's no doubt that people will prefer this cut, but it's unnecessarily long for what it is. For a good 90 minutes, it's all setup. I started to get very annoyed by this. And I'm well aware that this is the intention, but I found it hard to get through this first act. It just kept going and going and going. One thing that really bothered me was the focus on Lois Lane. I love Amy Adams and honestly she was the best performance out of here. We see her in her grief after the loss of Clark. But we get probably six scenes of that. The first two were perfectly fine and I could understand her character. Then to go along with it is the Super-Man theme from Man of Steel. Every scene that even mentioned his name played this theme. It's a great theme but I was so incredibly annoyed by it. The rendition is supposed to make us feel sad and all, but it's not letting us feel any other way. The score should motivate and not tell us what we must feel.Another thing causing the runtime to go longer than it needed to was the Snyder editing. In his movie 300, there's the constant action shots with slow motion. That has been what has defined his style ever since. There's so much slow motion that's it gets annoying. I'm perfectly fine seeing action how it plays out and I don't need to see the slowed down version of it. With Barry, obviously there's more of this since he's the Flash. Cut about 50% of these unnecessary slow motion scenes and I would've been good.And for my last major complaint, there's an epilogue that's supposed to setup what the universe would've been had things gone Snyder's way. It's a really cool epilogue and something I would've liked to see, but it didn't need to be included. It just added another 20ish minutes to tease something that won't happen. If it were included in the special features section or if Snyder released it another way, that would've been fine. This is just making it a test to see if someone can watch this all at once to see if they're dedicated to the franchise.Anyway, the movie is much better than most of the universe. I found it to be quite entertaining with a lot to offer. The action is very good. It's one of those movies that gets you at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. The CGI is good, with a few spotty moments. And it's shot beautifully. This was released in a 4:3 aspect ratio much like how they shoot something in IMAX. Personally, I don't think it added much to story and was there to get fans excited over something to make it look like art. Not to say it isn't but I'm not sure it added much to the experience. Still, it's very beautiful to look at. Everything on frame sets the mood for something much darker than we're used to seeing. This is a much better version than what we got previously and one of the best that both Snyder and the DCEU has given us. I'm still slightly mixed on this. Either I felt entertained or annoyed throughout. Many are going to praise this and I understand. I just can't say the same.", "Breath taking masterpiece": "The hype was real and the Snyder Cut was well worth the wait. This is the most breathtakingly beautiful superhero movie interpretation I've ever seen. The colours, the cinematography, the directing, the costumes, storyline and Hans Zimmer score just breath taking.The character development and story line is seamless. The Zack Snyder universe is what we all want.WB clearly have no idea about the direction of the DC UNIVERSE. The fact there is no Man of Steel part 2 and Ben Afflecks Batman never took off is a tragedy and speaks volumes.", "Better than the theater release but still a mess.": "I fell asleep. During the \"epic\" battle scene. After I drank coffee. Production was better, storyline improved, however still seriously glaring plot holes, character behaviors and decision making choices, and dialogue issues. Over use of epic poses against made-for-a-poster back drop. Over use of slo-mo. Seemed Zack Snyder was trying to recreate his 300 look with cinematography but this didn't play out as well in the context. Yes both were comic books, but while 300 was gritty and bleak, Justice league comics were full of color. Snyder did his best to make everything monochromatic including the iconic superman cape which was irritating and distracting. CGI everywhere making the film seem almost an animated movie in itself it felt so fake.Ben Affleck is a travesty as Batman. Henry Cavill was fine with what he had to work with. Ezra whoever was more tolerable this take but he epic-talked to himself and to others way too much running around where no one could hear him. Gal Gadot is beautiful and enjoyable as Wonder Woman, but with a 4 hour movie, her limitations as an actress became more apparent as she does not have a lot of variation on expression yet. Cyborg had improved character development but was so moody and pissed off all the time I never felt like we actually got to know him as a person. All heroes were morose, angry and upset the whole time except for Barry who was so contrastingly cheerful as to be cringe-y. Villains super powers were to be super boring. \"Rawr! We are evil and bent on doing evil because we like evil!\". No investment there.There were brief moments of scenes I thought were cool, some of it was very pretty; as a whole though, it overall didn't grab me. No feels, no joy, no satisfaction at beating the bad guy which was of course inevitable given the overpowered-ness of Wonder Woman and Superman. I have re-watched enjoyable movies over 20 times, I love re-experiencing a good flick. I will never ever put this on again on purpose, and I could care less if Snyder goes on to do more Justice League movies. I won't be paying for them.", "Everything we wanted the first time": "We got the development we needed! It told a way better, more fluid story that was not obviously interrupted by people trying to make it what they thought everyone wanted but really just making a mess.\nWe get to see our favorite characters actually be our favorite characters and we get to love them and feel for them!\nWe're left wanting more and dying to see another story that gets developed this way. The quick introduction of other DC characters makes me giddy to see another movie following this storyline.\nStop messing with your stories, characters and ACTORS Warner Bros because you'll get the masterpiece you/we want/need.", "It's definitely a Zack Snyder film": "Look, I really wanted to like this, okay...And in some ways, I do like it. Mainly in the way Zack Snyder and his fans actually got Warner Bros to spend an additional $70 million on a film that no one should have cared about after it released and was immediately revealed as a steaming pile of pig puke, but they cared anyway, and even if I'm not personally a fan, I'm very happy they got what they wanted.I also think this could set a good precedent for releasing long director's cuts of films onto streaming services, where I think they just make the most sense being on. You can't tell me Warner Bros would have signed off on this if Zack had demanded that it be released in theatres, and people don't buy all that many Blu-rays anymore...And in general, I like artists being able to do what they want in their own work, so I think this could set a good precedent for that as well...potentially. That said...come on, you want to see the Ayer cut of Suicide Squad? Really?Now, I do think this is better than Josstice League for sure...if only by virtue of it feeling consistent this time. At least I can say it definitely isn't the result of two directors, plus the studio all getting into a giant fight with a cartoon dust cloud obscuring the process until they're all passed out on the floor, presenting you the pile they've made of all their blood, poo and vomit combined. This is, at the very least, a whole poo taken by Zack Snyder.A whole looooong poo. On that note, this did not, in any way, need to be four bloody hours long. On another note, I really would have liked it if, in this extra two hours, there was more than about 15 minutes of anything substantive that wasn't set up for other films that'll probably never happen all crammed into the end, making the film feel like the last half an hour of Return Of The King, where the end of every single scene feels like it should be the moment the credits start rolling. Darkseid, who I recall being quite prominent in the marketing, is never a tangible threat in this at all, so we're still stuck with one of the most tedious and cliche villains in living memory.And no, adding a few lines of Steppenwolf saying that he failed at one point and is doing Darkseid's work for him for forgiveness does not cut it in my opinion. And why does he look like the character designer accidentally submitted the design they'd been doodling spikes on to make him as epic and badass as possible?The only major character I can actually say has some more depth to him now is Cyborg, who was already probably the best character in the Whedon cut, so even that feels pretty miniscule.It seems to me that the vast majority of what was either added on, or put in place of scenes cut out from the original version, consists of pointless details, set up for films that likely aren't happening anymore, and a lot of slow motion. In other words, it's definitely a Zack Snyder film now, through and through, so if you're a fan of his, then I'm sure you like it.And you know what? I'm genuinely very happy you like it, cause god knows if you like what Zack Snyder has done with DC over the last decade you've suffered enough ever since 2017. And like I said before, I just like it when an artist has control over their work.What I don't like is how half of the actors feel like they're majorly phoning it in, how the story is shockingly similar to the original for how much this was being hyped up, how its still pretty blandly directed, how horrendous some of the dialogue is, how the colour palette is still obnoxiously dark, how the effects still don't look great, and how almost none of the characters are likable or interesting to me.But other than that...yeah, I'm glad this happened.", "Justice is done finally": "You have to watch this movie to actually understand how bad the first one was made into, this is totally different movie, it's engaging gripping doesn't falter away from its storyline and more importantly it makes sense with Man of Steele and BvS and with the dark tone of what Zack Snyder wanted to continue with, thoroughly enjoyed this flick, never imagined that we fans would ever be able to watch Zack Snyder's vision, I hope Warner Bros give him the support to finish his story, thank you Zack for giving us our REAL Justice League.", "This World Won't Fall": "#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ForAutumn\nThank you Zack Snyder for this masterpiece!The 2021 director's cut of the 2017 superhero film Justice League is something else. With something else I mean it felt like a completely different movie. Even though I barely remember the theatrical cut since the last time I watched it was in 2017 when it came out, I noticed and saw so many news things that blew my mind.First of all, the character development in this cut is done in such way you actually care for the characters as the movies progresses. That is something the original cut was lacking, in my opinion. I found myself adoring Cyborg (Victor Stone) and the Flash (Barry Allen) much more than I did before, just because their stories were told and told well.Steppenwolf really stepped up his game in this movie. First of all, he actually felt more menacing. Mainly because of his new look, but also because you learn that he is fighting for his life by taking world, due to the debt he has to pay. When he was brutally murdered by the Justice League, I actually felt a slight bit of remorse - something I didn't feel whatsoever in the other cut. Knowing that he has to pay an unpayable debt to Darkseid is something that changes so much about the understanding of his motivation when it comes to taking entire planets. What I also really like about their dynamic is the fact that they really show you how powerful Darkseid actually is. Steppenwolf is extremely powerful, and showing him to be somewhat afraid of Darkseid just tells you how much power he possesses.The soundtrack in this movie was also top notch! I have been listening to it non-stop. The Justice League 'Theme' song (if I may call it that) is extremely catchy and it's great to here it queue into the score every now and then. And of course, hearing parts from the 'Man Of Steel' soundtrack was bone chilling and just absolutely amazing! The cinematography was nice to look at but in the beginning I did not enjoy the frequent slow-motion shots.In this movie, I didn't feel much of a connection to Aquaman. I believe that is mainly because this was his introduction and he was yet to be the King of Atlantis. I did on the other hand really like Wonder Woman in this movie. They really managed to show off how powerful she truly is. And of course, the Batman himself was a straight-up badass. Seeing him fight along side these powerful beings and actually managing to survive and do damage is extremely satisfying to watch. I do which they had given him another time to truly shine like in the warehouse fight scene from Batman V. Superman.Superman's return felt fitting. I don't remember how it went in the original cut, but the way it was explained in this one seemed reasonable to me. I loved how near the end they truly showed off how much of an unstoppable force he is.Finally, the Knightmare sequences. This is probably something I love the most about this movie. I truly want to see a movie dedicated to this world, perhaps a Justice League 2. Even though the Joker showing up felt a bit random to me, it was a fun fan service and I'm sure it could have a better explained reason if there were to be a Justice League 2. I would absolutely love to see Batman, Deathstroke, The Martian Manhunter and the others in action without the support of Aquaman and Wonder Woman, trying to defeat Darkseid and the evil Superman.I truly hope this 'world' can be brought to the big screen again someday! Since I gave 'Avengers Infinity War' a 9/10, and since this movie is neck-on-neck with that one for me, I am also giving this one a 9/10!.", "A cut above": "Zach Snyder's\nJustice LeagueFinally the Snyder cut makes its way into reality and on to the big screen.\nActually no, this superior version of the DC team up comes straight to a living room near you.Snyder gets to right the wrong that was 2017's botched but still mildly enjoyable 'Justice League'.\nThe Snyder cut is an entirely different animal.\nNot just a Directors cut with the odd extended scene or two minutes of new material bolted on.\nThe Snyder cut is a completely new and different film.\nAt almost four hours long there's around two hours of unseen footage weaved in to create a cohesive movie.\nUnlike the original this film is fleshed out giving characters and story arc rich development.\nRay Fisher's Cyborg benefiting most from this.\nSure, the plot is basically the same but the approach and delivery is handled with much care and attention.\nObviously a labour of love for Director Snyder.\nHe has answered the fans giving them the movie they so rightly deserved in the first place.\nRedemption is served.\nSnyder can now sit back content in the knowledge that his vision has been realised.Epic and masterpiece are often words loosely thrown around.\nWhilst this film may be epic in scale it is still by no means a masterpiece.\nIt is a massive improvement over the original effort but some scenes look rushed and unpolished. Some CGI is rendered as though the budget ran out half way through post production.\nThe villain is still forgettable and a painting by numbers attempt, though a much improvement over the original incarnation.\nNot on the same level of threat as Marvel's Thanos or with the same amount of depth.\nSteppenwolf is generic at best.\nMarvel dedicated many years to build towards the events in the Infinity Wars saga. This DC equivalent still remains as a cash and grab affair.\nI am nitpicking here.\nSnyder's film is utterly absorbing even if it may not have the refinement and longevity of the Marvel movies.\nEven with the bloated runtime. I don't think there's a scrap of footage left on the cutting room floor. I was truly transfixed from beginning to end.Technically 'The Snyder cut' has much to rejoice in.\nBoldly we get a 4.3 aspect ratio.\nFor the none Home\nTheatre nerds this means the picture will look the same shape as your Grans TV.\nOriginally intended as an IMAX presentation the 4.3 ratio gives us more image top and bottom.\nFor those with home projection screens or huge TV's , you're in for a visual feast.\nThose with a small widescreen monitor will curse and shake their fists at the screen.\nActually the image looks rather stunning. Especially with motion. Panning shots around buildings look three dimensional. Almost as if the movie was shot in 60fps.\nI watched the movie through Sky TV in the UK on release day.\nI was promised UHD with Dolby Atmos sound.\nOk Sky where's the Atmos?\nClearly advertised but not available. I had to check the Sky forum because I thought my AVR was malfunctioning.\nSadly no Dolby Atmos at time of writing.\nStill the 4K image was good. But again sadly no HDR.\nThis is a sharp looking movie shot on 35mm.\nNot the best 4K has to offer but a very cinematic experience none the less.\nYou have to commend Sky for offering the movie at no extra cost.\nSound is a little disappointing without the promised Atmos mix.\nThe Dolby Digital Plus signal upmixed with Dolby Surround allows for an immersive experience but overall clarity and dynamic range is severely lacking.\nI had to crank up my AVR way passed eleven to get anything decent in the way of impact.\nThe sound mix sounds heavily compressed at low volume lacking detail and sparkle.\nHopefully by the time you read this review Sky will have amended this and also offered HDR.So to sum up. 'Zach Snyder's Justice League is a million percent better than the original Joss Whedon theatrical cut.For those who haven't a clue what all this is about . This movie may be a tedious overly long experience.\nBut for the fans...\nJustice has been served!", "Awesome to see": "The movie is quitely improved in a impressive way .

Zack Snyder's movie is the absolute best!#RestoreTheSnyderverse.", "Redemption at its finest!!": "The Synder Cut covers plot holes, ties back to previous movies, and gives more reasons to care for each character and give them a chance to show off their purpose in this movie. Now I can empathise with Cyborg, instead of thinking that he is just an extra member of the team who moans a lot. Flash is less of a joke and Aquaman had been used much better. In the 2017 release, it did the complete opposite and made me dislike most of the characters, especially Cyborg and The Flash. Nevertheless, I still disagree with the cast of the character of The Joker and Lex Luthor. Luthor's performance looked as if William Shatner and Roger Rabbit had merged into one. As for The Joker it's nothing special, but I don't hate it - I accept it for what it is. I also felt that Affleck played Bruce Wayne better than Batman, and every time he wore a suit he looked very uncomfortable. Overall the Snyder cut is fun, visually stunning, and easy to follow, especially if you're not a comic book fanatic.

Thank you.I have always enjoyed going to the theater to watch movies. Recent bankruptcies in the movie theater industry due to the nation's pandemic response led to some strong feelings of regret for me until i watched this movie.The 4 hours long movie is possible because it was released to a streaming service first. I loved every minute. I can pause the show, take a break, and come right back for more. We're all used to doing this anyway when we bingewatch our favorite tv shows. I think the days of the micromanaging studios cutting the director's work down to fit into their ideal movie theater duration are coming to an end.I believe the writers, directors and editors, are going to be more free to flesh out their stories.Please DC, bring back Zack Znyder, and all of these actors and actresses to continue this epic story.", "Marvel Fanboys cant handle a good movie!": "Yes its long.

It's an incredible journey that takes place over 4 hours; that certainly doesn't feel like 4 hours. The character development, incredible. The action set pieces, spectacular. The acting and writing, stellar. It's an experience and something that I won't forget for a long, long time. It sets up so much, from spin off films for each league member, a sequel to this film, and branches in the multi-verse to be explored. It would be abhorrent to lose such an incredibly talented cast, all whom love their roles and characters they play!If you're a fan of superhero/comic book movies, this is one to watch.My only critique was the placement of the nightmare sequence. The nightmare sequence, even though I enjoyed, it felt a little disconnected and might've worked better as an end credit scene instead of being 'attached' to the film. It was a great scene within itself, suggesting the past between Batman and the Joker, and the future of the SnyderVerse.

It follows on so beautifully from Man of Steel & Dawn of Justice, & it properly feels like a DC film, darker & more edgy & violent. I'm a big DC animated fan, & this film reminded me of those.\nTo all those people complaining about the long run-time, it's been marked into 6 parts, so you can watch up to the next part & come back to it (if you can bear to do that) I only did that coz my hubby wanted to, but I could easily have watched it from beginning to end in one go.\nI felt much more empathy with the characters in this version, as their backstories were further developed & you understood better, where their struggles were coming from.\nSteppenwolf was a much better villian, & his motivations actually made a lot more sense in this version, with the addition of Darkseid. I really, really hope there's going to be JL2 with Zach Snyder at the helm, coz I want to see more Darkseid, & what a teaser at the end with Batman & co in that post apocalyptic scene! I gotta know what's gonna happen!!\nAnd Henry Cavill's Superman in a black suit...yum.\nMy only negative, was, even though the effects were awesome, there was an awful lot of slo-mo action, & I would like to see more of Flash just being fast.\nIn summary, I loved it.

I still spread the #releasethesnydercut hashtag, But I felt like it was pointless over time... Until the fandom finally got what we have been wanting. Once Warner Brothers announced that this was happening. I couldn't believe it... and now it's here, and let me just say. The movie is EPIC. It feels much more better than what we got before. The movie starts off to familiar scenes you have seen in other movies, but then picks up to a particular individual trying to track down another individual, the events folding up into this moment is much more interesting complex and remarkable, this isn't even the start of it. The story feels much more fleshed out across the film. Characters get much more of the spot light and even MORE surprises that not even I would have expected. The ending is one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen in a movie... I'll just say this, what Snyder has done here is unlike anything achieved in film... getting this cut alone was not only nearly impossible, but the film itself is impossible to have done what it did... but it did... easily a 8/10 hands down. And the reasons are because sometimes the movie gives way too much to explain a certain plot point instead of diving to it, and sometimes Snyder just beats a dead horse on a part of the story... other than that this movie is amazing.

Like the prior version, it just doesn't have the panache of the Marvel films. It's within the script and storyline....something feels flat.

The one we were all waiting for the entire film. Perhaps Cavill was not the right casting but more likely it was poor scripting and storyline. Also feel like batman could have been more commanding and impressive - they should find a way of mirroring the character from the Xbox games. The joker is awful. Just wrong casting all the way.

It gives more space to all the characters, letting each one have their own reason for fighting and those not presented have their moment so that the viewer feels something for these characters, Steppenwolf is extremely well inserted in the story, even if Darkseid appears little, he exists . The 4: 3 format, violence and a heavier language help the film to get closer to whoever is watching. But not everything here is good, Snyder puts long shots, a giant excess of slow motion that gets tired with 40 minutes.

No more. Zach Snyder's super power is that if he keeps this up, He is going to be one of the greatest directors of his kind. What an accomplishment! Justice League has finally been born. Wow!", "i cant belive it": "They actually killed every one there gone all gone except plastic man why zack snyder and where is captain america and thanos.", "Best DC movie": "I rate it better then avengers assemble and avengers age of ultron.", "Not boring at all": "Very nice movie with so many stories coming together and nice theme settings.

I like both. Snyder did a great job. Well worth the 4hours.", "The most epic superhero movie ever made.": "Like him or loathe him, but this was beautiful. I'm a comic nerd from a kid, and I've loved Marvel since then, so I'm not just a Snyder fanboy. But the journey from man of steel (I never thought Superman's theme from Williams could be bettered) but my word is it awesome. The extended BvS was butchered and then joss whedon made a terrible movie. And by the sounds of things was not exactly a top guy. But this movie, was beyond expectations. The greatest cast that I think will be difficult to beat, in the most beautiful, epic, emotional and wonderful superhero movie I've ever seen. People complain about the slow mo, but when you've gods and hero's moving faster than we could see, it makes sense and creates quite brilliant on screen art. Give yourself the time and space to watch it in its entirety. Each hero is incredible, and Cyborg's story becomes so important it's easy to see why he was so hurt it was all cut out.Perfect. (Screen ratio aside). And if they don't finish the story and finish an arc with Cavill, it would be such a waste. They are the Justice League, and as a man in his 40's watching this, I've never been happier watching a superhero movie.", "This is an amazing Work - worth your time": "The 2017 version was so unimpressive to me I was not excited to watch this one. But I am so glad I sat down to watch it. What a difference. This one makes sense and is visually stunning. The characters were explored so much more resulting in compelling, and exciting storytelling. The viewer is skillfully drawn into the narrative of each superhero and so understands their challenges and motivations. There is so much here for the viewer to relate to and care about. By the middle of the four hour journey I was all in, committed and rooting for them all. I'm a Snyder fan for life now. Bottom line is that this is a classic, not to be missed.", "Snyder Cut Duration": "First, i thought this movie is too long, 4 hour.... But after i watched it, now i agree how this movie has 4 hour duration.\nMarvel set up they're superhero backstory by films (ironman, captain america,..) but when it comes to Snyder cut. They rather build the heroes backstory in one long movie so we can more connected to the heroes condition, issue, problems and even they're real personality!Second, Snyder cut explain more about the upcoming villainThats it\nThats my review\nSorry for (maybe) bad grammar", "An outstanding superhero movie, but also a great movie.": "The movie connects you emotionally with each character, they all shine and their backstory is fleshed out.The mythological aspect is everything you could wish for.\nThe cinematography is impressive and Junkie XL's score is phenomenal.In a way, this movie wouldn't have been as good if it was released in the theaters, HBO Max is really the best way to preserve Zack Snyder's vision -- they would never have released a 4h movie. But the runtime allows the story to breathe, the pacing is excellent.Beautifully crafted, maybe one of the best superhero movie ever. \"The Lord of the Rings\" of superheroes!", "Bored": "Saying it's better than the theatrical cut is not an accomplishment or compliment. This fluff fest is 10% slow motion and really drags on at times. It should have been a mini series as to not let Zacks habits (slow motion, the over use of chanting to set emotions, the lack of light and colour) be so obvious.The film does explain more, but that doesn't make it a perfect movie.", "#restorethesnyderverse is the new moment": "Restorethesnyderverse is the new moment\nThank you zack.. Nothing much to say", "This is Justice League, forget about the 2017 version": "I have watched it twice. Yes twice a movie which is 4 hours long. This movie is the best parts that could be kept from the 2017 version, some improvements in acting and dialog, improved scenes, and new scenes.No spoilers here, YOU GOTTA WATCH IT!And PLEASE!! Do continue the story. IT MUST HAPPEN!What I didn't like. 4:3 screen but got used to it quick.Some action scenes, IMO, required a better soundtrack. One that was... more \"heart pumping\".", "People giving this 1 star didn't understand": "This film was 1000 times better than the Whedon cut. This film has everything well put in music, slow mo visual effects were stunning and the aspect ratio is actually quite good. The film yes is long and it could've be cut into 3 hour film but that being said it made me care for the characters all had a great build up and got you excited to see the big boss battle at the end with Steppenwolf. Synderverse fans will love this film, Synder haters will say it's boring don't listen to them. This film is very enjoyable and if you are a DC fan or casual superhero movie fan you will love this film and want more, hopefully sequels \ud83d\udc4c", "Zack Snyder's Justice League: A Distress Call to 'Restore The Snyder Verse'": "As we all know \"The Justice Got Served\" at March 18, 2021 after Zack Snyder's highly anticipated extended version of 'Justice League' got released all around the globe. The moment has come when disappointed DC fans have got what they've been fighting for since four years. I must say, the fight, all those 'Release The Snyder Cut' campaigns, were worth it.This is the Justice League we all deserved, but it might not be the way someone had desired. That might with the mighty reasons: being four hours long - mashed with stretched anecdotes of comic book heroes in total of six parts, jars of CGI dropping free - will catch you off guard if you re just in for a blithe action-packed superhero movie.Let s defy the aforementioned casual approach, and say the might is right, as the director seems at his full glory here.Zack Snyder left no stone unturned to garner as much 'filling' as he could, for the backstory of all heroes. In 2017 s theatrical cut we could sense Cyborg & Flash getting side-lined but not this time. I did not find a single character lacking grit.Talking of the villains, unlike Joss Whedon s wacky attempt, we re drawn much closer to comic books. The bad guy Steppenwolf finally looks much more intimidating.The movie s fight sequences remain perfectly executed, putting right amount of tension on strings attached with the tale. The visual effects were great, except for some overkill in Flash s slow-mob sequences. Cinematography is dark, as in the signature Snyder style.The question remains, what s changed and how much has changed? Well, it is a lot, to be specific. I remember when Zack Snyder left the production of Justice League 2017 , Whedon went off the line adding newly shot scenes but he couldn t handle it well (which we clearly saw).Before I go into expositions full of jabs at Whedon, let me make it clear, even Snyder would have been picky for a theatrical release back that time. And that's where a director's cut has its own perks. So, it appears Whedon has been finally cast out, as the scenes solely credit Mr. Snyder.The main difference is, how coherent storytelling changed the narrative from start till the end. At some point you realise, it's all about Superman coming back to life and saving the day for fellow heroes. The way it gets executed in Snyder's cut, it's the ultimate revival for Superman. In previous version of the film we saw the Batman pushing his limits out of guilt, and trying to bring Superman back, earning the Wonder Woman's displeasure during a discussion over her lost love as well. Unlike before we get a unanimous decision, and all of the heroes come to the conclusion of bringing Superman back. All thanks to Cyborg's backstory stitched in the scene, which paved the path to this smooth transition.You have a treat ahead at part 6 which is termed 'Something Darker'. The ending is more powerful when you see the big bad guy Darkseid nearly confronting The Justice League. Yes, you heard me. Although Darkseid seizes the deal, his screen time was lesser yet enough to have a nice Villain Supremo Vs Nice Guys experience.The way story has been woven, with the epic epilogue at the end, it surely hints at director s profound vision for a great cinematic universe targeted at comic book geeks. You get many new characters like Martian Manhunter, Deathstroke being introduced to big screen.My bonus mentions are Lex Luther & Jared Leto. Jared totally surprised me, with his very short yet immaculate appearance in the post-apocalyptic scene. That scene is a pure reflection from comics, specially that Joker s S.W.A.T vest. Damn you, Snyder! The epilogue, agonising to some, has also raised many questions asking for a sequel to Justice League.The Snyder's Justice League might have been average superhero movie, but the past s comedy brought us here, all hyped up. I must say, it lives to the hype. What Snyder has given, no wonder this movie is a scream for restoring 'SnyderVerse'.", "Classic and worthy": "Genuinely classic and impressive, knightmare scenes are on another level \ud83d\udd25, junkie XL also did his job great. Ending is completely different...", "\"You have been near a mother box. The scent is on you\" lol": "This was like a brain bleach to help me forget that I watched the disastrous WW84!I hope this is an indication that DC will continue to focus on entertainment, and not social agenda pandering.", "A Masterpiece of a Passion Project": "Beauty. So much better than you would ever think. Give it a chance.", "Dead movie becomes a masterpiece": "I had my doubts about the Snyder cut but after watching 4 hours, my doubts are gone. Even though it was a lengthy movie the time went by fast because of how engaging and intense the scenes were. Now I want a sequel and if Zack Snyder isn't directing then I ain't watching. In Snyder we trust.", "Snyder's Magnum Opus": "This will probably the best film that director Zack Snyder will ever make. The humor, the action, the story, so much heart has been put into this film that it'll stand the test of time as a masterclass in superhero filmmaking.", "This is DC!": "I honestly do not have the words to describe how phenomenal this movie is. I will attempt to assemble some meager sentences to describe it, but it will not come close to how I felt watching this. This truly is the best live action DC project to date. Zack Snyder understands DC. I've never been much for the Marvel vs DC debate, because they are so different. I have love for both, but for very different reasons. This is dark, this is brutal, and this is DC. Allegations and such aside, I have no disrespect for Joss Whedon as a director. Firefly will always be among my favorite sci fi universes, and Buffy, Angel and Dollhouse will always have my love and respect, too. Unfortunately, Joss was not the right director for DC. It's a shame that the first Justice League had the issues it did, and it's also a shame that everyone points the finger at Joss for it. But now we have something so much more epic and brilliant than we could have hoped for. I am so grateful to all who were involved in bringing Zacks vision to light. I know the chances are slim, but I would love to see the Snyderverse continue. This is the DC live action universe I so desperately want to see more of. When a 4 hour movie leaves you wanting more, like immediately more, that is a sign of something special. Thank you so much, Zack! You have made this lifelong DC fan so happy. On a side note, Ben Affleck truly is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne to date. Cyborg, Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Supes are all equally as perfectly cast. These actors embody their characters so perfectly. The cast, the effects, the story and soundtrack. Everything about this movie, in my opinion, was perfection. Such an experience!", "GREAT movie with a few minor issues": "This movie is 100 times better than the 2017 version, this version makes flash and cyborg actually useful and good characters, Ben Affleck's batman, Gal gadot's wonder woman and Heny Cavil's superman are all as good as they were in other movies which isn't bad, Aquaman felt kind of left out and useless unfortunately in this version but he wasn't a bad character by any means, the amazons are the best they've ever been in this. Steppenwolf is now a pretty good villain. one of the main problems for me whilst watching this though was the marketing, the marketing made it seem like Darkseid would have at least 15-30mins of screen time when he ended up getting 5 maximum, the bat tank appeared for like 2 seconds, and the knightmare stuff was only in the movie for 1 scene. Also I'm 99% sure Zack Snyder said the history fight would be 20 minutes long which it definitely didn't end up being (still was a good fight though). Best DCEU Movie yet, 9/10", "I can't believe my eyess!!": "I really can't believe how the best scenes and all\nof the great character development was taken out in the theatrical cut!! This movie is amazing and I am glad I finally see the original view of what it was. I really hope they continue with it.", "Just wow \ud83d\udc4f": "Well worth the wait just a shame this wasn't the movie we had in the first place. It would of taking the whole DC movies in a totally different direction.\nI just hope WB learn from this but I doubt it \ud83d\ude14", "The Justice League We Needed": "Incredible film adaptation that was finally able to make it to the \"big screen\". You get everything that was missing in the original Justice League movie (plot, backstory, good CGI, impressive dialogue, and hope for the DC Universe) and then so much more. The action scenes were incredibly done and intense. After a while, those slow shots get very repetitive and tedious, though. Besides that, it was very well done and something that everyone should be excited about. Fantastic job!", "Much better, and almost watchable, but still a really, really bad movie": "No secret that Justice League (original) suffered from too much studio interference, bad mix of Snyder and Whedon, horrible CGi, bad story, horrible script which together lead to one of the biggest disaster in cinema history. So is this better and did Snyder make a great movie?Nah... it is better, but going from 1/10 to a 3/10 is nothing to really celebrate.So what does this movie do better?\nexposition; we get actual backstories, an actual story, and we get to more about characters and what motivate them.Story-wise the plot and movie is better hold togetherCGi slightly improved and no horrible moustache deletion.No stupid Russian family and much less ill-placed jokes.The tone is the same all throughout and you feel it is one directorSeveral scenes, especially with the Amazons and Diana is much better hold together and conveyed in this version.Basically the plot, characters, and the movie as a whole \"work\" as in it is not a complete horrible mess as the original cut was.The problems however are still massive.First of all I get the feeling Snyder kept too much instead - the movie is 4 hours long and boy do you feel it. It is not THAT much of a plot and story to keep it all together and give us this much of runtime. And sure we get better backstories, but this suffers from almost the opposite problem to the original. The first cut dumbed down everything and cut it all so darn short that we had no clue who is who, who can do what, and gave no motivation.\nThis version is bloated instead with so much slow burning mini-arcs and so much boring dragged out dialogue that the 4 hours almost feels like 8 hours. The ending is like 15min long with more \"endings\" then The Lord of the Rings.Things are still convoluted, make little to no sense, and Barry is still annoying as a mosquito at bedtime. CGi, although improved, is still horrendous.There are also a few things that is actually worse in this movie... go figure...Every single \"guest\" or \"surprise\" appearance is so forced, so badly done and so cringe I could almost not watch.The bloated run-time as mention above make the movie actually more boring than the first one which was at least fun to do a drinking game to, this is sooooo boooringThe weird \"cut-scenes\" to the future or whatever is worse than in BvSDarkside is about as menacing as a pair of wet socksI give props to Snyder to sticking to his formula from BvS and Man of Steel, so if you liked those two movies you might like this too. For me however it was okayish, almost watchable and a decent superhero movie and actually one of the better of the DCEU - but it is still a really bad movie.3/10 and I can only recommend this to people that like the two other Snyder movies... the rest of you should probably stay away.", "A real Justice League movie": "I loved this movie. Awesome scenes and thems songs. Zack Snyder's Justice League needs a second and third movie and fourth movie. A real Justice League movie. You are not gonna lost your time to watch this movie, it's long, but it's worth to watch. I love the way Zack Snyder divided the movie in parts.", "A triumph for artistic freedom and respect for a vision of a creatot": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) Dir. Zack Snyder\nIts launch is a transcendent fact. It emanates from the campaign that emerged on social networks a few years ago in which millions of fans demanded the opportunity to see the director's original cut. After seeing it yesterday afternoon and comparing it with the patched and cut version of 2017, the importance of the movement that brought the director's cut to life is clearly understood.\nA triumph for artistic freedom and respect for the vision of a creator. It also makes it clear that decisions made by Warner executives are clumsy; based on money and not, on creative issues. Any number of movies that were meant to be memorable were not due to negligence of this kind and became clunky in the editing room.\nThere are no half measures with Zack Snyder. You love or hate his job. In my case, since I saw in the cinema (several times) back in 2013, 'Man of Steel', I knew that DC superheroes were in good hands. Unfortunately, superhero cinema has become a multimillion dollar business that puts monetary interests before following a style, over the artistic imprint of the director. Snyder's epic style, serious tone contrasted with Marvel's lighthearted and more digestible tone.\nFrom this limited and commercialist vision, Warner was more concerned with reaching Marvel without realizing that Snyder was creating a superhero cinema with a different artistic ambition and with its own identity.\nThose of us who were avid comic book readers in childhood and adolescence immediately understood what Snyder was doing: being as faithful as possible to the comic book narrative in substance and form. It is not surprising that Justice League has a 4: 3 format. As if it were a cartoon vignette.\nThe truth is that it works well. During the four hours of duration, several frames provide the pleasant sensation of being taken from a magazine. Vignettes in motion.\nFor some, the length of the film may be an excess, it is not. It has been perfectly structured in six parts and an epilogue.\nPart 1 - Don't Count On It / Don't count on it\nPart 2 - Batman & The Age of Heroes / Batman and the Age of Heroes\nPart 3 - Beloved Mother, Beloved Son / Amada Madre, Beloved Son\nPart 4 - Change Machine / M\u00e1quna de Cambio\nPart 5 - All the King's Horses\nPart 6 - Something Darker / Something Dark\nEpilogue.\nThere is no waste in the 240 minutes. The narrative bumps in the 2017 version are effectively solved. Delving into the evolutionary construction of character development. Mainly Cyborg and Flash. It delves deeper into their contexts and life circumstances. Lois Lane's grief and grief over the loss of Clark / Superman and Lois's inability to rejoin her life is shown. Batman / Bruce Wayne puts aside the pragmatism that characterizes him to become a man of faith in his five companions, in his capabilities and in what they can achieve together.\nA love for the characters is perceived and the effort to show them fully with their respective chiaroscuro of personality.\nThe epilogue is powerful and impressive. Marking trails for upcoming deliveries. I think the time has come for Warner to reconsider and reinsert Snyder's vision to the DCEU.", "Absolutely Amazingly Awesome!!!": "Let the reviews do the speaking. Currently at I write this, it's an 8.6 versus a 6.4 on the original that was released. If you have not seen this, you gotta.

Everything about this movie was good!!", "4 hours of awfulnes": "This movie proves why it was rewritten and how incompetend Zack truly is as a director.\nFirst off, yes, this movie has all the flaws that make a Snyder movie and it is definitively more watchable than the garbage that came out in 2017.As a fan of DC, super hero movies and good movies, I was left dissatisfied and even slightly insulted.Everything is CGI. There is one set. A big green room. Nothing is real and it looks terrible.At least 40% is just padding. Just wasting time with nothingness. The 4 hours are NOT justified.Like 60% of action is slow motion. It gets boring sooo quickly, you have no idea.The \"actors\" suck. They are all just terrible. They cost so much money and they are so bad. Did Zack not care at all? Was it all improv?\nAlso, why is Ben Affleck the most uncharismatic Bruce Wayne ever? Why does Jesse as Lex Luther behave like the Riddler?There is very little sense to anything that happens. Zack wastes soooo much time instead of actually explain anything is just insulting.The movie is filmed by an armature. No sense of colors, lighting, FOCUS?!There is music EVERYWHERE! That is because every \"actor\" suck, the scenes have no emotions, so Zack has to over-compensate with music.Again, this movie was better than the 2017 thing, but it was still equally painful.", "All hail lord darkseid": "The best movie I have ever watched\nIt's great\nThe graphics\nThe cgi\nVFX\nEvery thing about the movie is just so great.", "ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE is a film every DC fan dreamed to see someday..": "As someone who loves man of steel and BvS to death, this movie is nothing less than masterpiece for me.. I've never expected this movie to be that good.. from action to vfx to cgi to visuals to cinematography to soundtrack to story to performance , this movie exceeds my expectations.. this film is directed by ZACK SNYDER ,and believe me there is no other director in Hollywood who can make this type of comic book movies other than him.. people love him that's why they called for this movie after 2017's disaster.. and guess what our efforts paid off and we got to see Snyder's epic vision once more.. this film brings back tears of joy and happiness when I heard epic music from man of steel.. Junkie XL has done an amazing job with scoring this movie, hearing epic versions of wonder woman theme and Superman theme from past is nothing less than magnificent.. In aspect of storytelling this film perfectly balanced every cinematic element very perfectly.. this film developed it's characters very well, Batman has became a true hero who wants to make an alliance to defend the world ,the dark angry rage filled violent batman from BvS is long gone, here he is a leader.. superman finally found out his purpose in life, he became hero he always meant to be, he fulfilled his father's wishes by becoming a hero and saved world again for 3rd time.. WW accepted his role as a warrior and tries to help humanity.. Aquaman accepted his heritage and helped other heroes to defend the world.. flash tried to became a hero just like he always wanted.. Finally biggest surprise is cyborg, it will not be wrong to say that this film also works as an origin story of cyborg.. he just steals the show, he went from a lost man to became a hero and accepting himself.. On other hands steppenwolf is really looks like a villain here, a monster from another world who wants to conquer earth in order to please darkseid.. darkseid's limited role is also well shown.. now talking about action scenes this film has some of the best action scenes ever seen in a movie.. from steppenwolf attacking thymescira to taking underwater Atlantis fight to tunnel battle to kal el vs heores and finally final battle against the villain is just epic.. this film again proved that Ben Affleck is best batman and Henry cavill is best superman. it also redeemed Jared Leto as joker, before this movie he was a joke but now he'll always remembered as one of the best characters in DCEU as he knows something that no other joker in live action movies has ever known.. the pre ending scene will give you chills as it lays the seeds for future movies... I am very hopeful that someday they'll announce the sequels to this epic movie on HBO max, otherwise without jl 2 and 3 DC will be doomed again.. this is DCEU's rare second opportunity I hope they don't waste it... and also one more thing in last..

Anyways, this movie is absolutely amazing, though it is a little long, and probably could've benefitted from less slow-motion, which was apparently 10% of this movie! Nonetheless, this movie has a great story, great villains, even better characters, and was the definition of epic!8.5/10.", "A pivotal moment": "This version of Justice League may very well be looked back on in ten years as a pivotal moment in movie-making history. The entertainment industry has been shifting more and more toward television with fantastic quality shows popping up more and more, with streaming services this will only increase the budgets of these shows. A lot of people want more content, rather than less. Marvel have proven that there is certainly a market for 3+ hour epics. While 4 hours will likely never be the norm, it is important that the people in charge of the studios allow the filmmakers to see through the vision they hired them for in the first place. Zack Snyder's Justice League is something you can build a franchise on and continue to expand, 2017's JL simply wasn't, as it spent far too little time on character development for an ensemble movie with this man characters who had yet to be introduced. This version does a far better job at flashing out the likes of Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash.

It is practically another movie and to be more precise it is actually the original version of the film, since 2017 was an altered and unfinished project that should not have even seen the light of day.The story arc and development, the set design, the visual art and its improved soundtrack by Junkie XL make the Snyder cut one of the best comic book films made so far.Warner should learn to trust more in the work of its directors, stop putting their hands where they should not and allow total creative freedom to avoid the mistakes made as in 2017, hopefully from now on they will know how to take better advantage of DC's great product.", "Finally!": "Faith restored.

Every character gets the development they rightfully deserve, and the the four hour run time is not wasted. It is used to set up an amazing multilayered world on earth with different factions. It is very clear that this movie was made by a true fan of the dc universe. We need to see where Zach's vision lies. If there is any doubt in your kind about if you should watch this movie, give it a a chance. The action sequencs are incredible, and the storytelling is amazing. I'm begging the cast to reunite to finish this vision. It sounds crazy but this film gives the DC Univers to be better than marvel.", "Justice Has Been Served": "Restore the Snyderverse! This is an epic that we almost missed - one of the best superhero films.Please, more snyderverse!", "Cheesy, messy and drawn out": "This movie is so morally questionable, tired and over egged. Its one, 'wouldn't that be a cool shot' after another. It feels like three hours of montage with about 30 minutes of plot. I'm at a point now where I don't think Zack Snyder knows how to tell stories or make good movies. This is the last thing of his I'll watch unless I hear rave reviews from critics I really trust.", "Must be seen in 3D or 4K minimum": "There are a lot of good reviews so the only thing I can add is that these movies must be seen in 3-D to get the greatest effect. 4K Is good however 3D is way better.", "A Triumph!": "Finally! The continuation of the story that began with Man of Steel, into BvS, and now streamed into our living rooms. This film is pure DC comics goodness. Every shot is beautiful, and the CGI is more than commendable (Incredible!) in spite of the short timeframe with which Zack and his team had been given to restore the effects. Each League member has an opportunity to stand out and shine on their own, and when they come together it is a thing of beauty! The storyline is cohesive, allowing clear motivations to be shown for our hero's and villains alike. I was particularly impressed with the performance of Ray Fisher (Cyborg) as his backstory is fully fleshed out in a way that was completely disregarded by the 2017 debacle. There is infinite re-watchability here, four hour runtime aside. I'll definitely be purchasing a physical copy, 4K Ultra HD, whenever it eventually gets released. I really hope Warner Media decides to follow through with the \"Snyderverse\" and finish the story arcs as was intended in a Justice League trilogy. Here's to hoping. This is a 10/10, no doubt about it.", "The film that redeems all of Zack's DC movies": "Zack Snyder's Justice League was definitely the \"Once Upon a Time in America\" to Snyder's \"Leone\": a masterpiece that could only be seen in it's full version. Definitely one of the best films of 2021, it also helps redeem Zack's former DC films. Haters of \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v. Superman: Ultimate Edition\" will be able to look back at the films and see how far Zack was planning for the future of his characters and what their respective character arcs meant. Definitely worth the watch.", "Unbelievable.": "This is not even close to the same movie that was released back in 2017. If only it was, I'd love to see the DCEU with this as cannon. It fixed everything that was wrong with the movie. The character development was perfect. Please, WB, #restorethesnyderverse, even if it's only on HBO Max.", "JUSTICE FOR THE JUSTICE LEAGUE!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is the movie that should be released 4 years ago\nI still have no words to describe this brutality\nWithout spoilers I can say that the story is the same as the 2017 version, but better told\nThe characters have a magnificent development and some characters like Steppenwolf and Leto's Joker manage to redeem themselves from their past versions and give them logical motivations. All characters have their moments but without a doubt the best is Cyborg\nThe 4 hours fly by, they are not bored or in a hurry\nThe movie of course, it has its flaws, but they are only 5% of the movie.\nI can't say anything else without spoilers, I just know you're going to enjoy it being a fan of Snyder's work or not.", "It is not at all like the 2017 flick. This world is great!": "I thought that at the end of the day it would be similar to the 2017 film. But boy was I wrong. It is very different. Snyder has a vision indeed and it would be great if DCU continues in that direction.Despite being 4 hours long every arc was interesting. Every character seems to have been done justice. I first checked out the final fight scene directly. It is so very different. There are so many differences between 2017 and this one. The stakes are higher and I felt that all characters got their due. Wonder woman is a warrior. A badass warrior. Batman get his due. There are some cool stunts. And flash's power is oh so amazing. The premonition that Batman has makes a lot of sense and he is not the only one who gets a glimpse of the horrible future. And a special mention to cyborg. Now I actually understood how cyborg is and how powerful he actually is. Even Steppenwolfs agenda is better and clear now.And then there is darkseid. Period. I don't even understand how so much was cut out in 2017. The two new movies are vastly diffrrent that 2017 feels like a silly movie. How messed up it was.I came away pleasantly surprised. Caution: if you go without expectations you will be hugely rewarded.", "A triumphant achievement": "Wow. This was a wonderful direct sequel to Man of Steel and BvS and - what I can only assume was gonna be part one of a two-part Justice League film.I'm not spoiling anything cause the movie begs to be experienced. The 4 Hour runtime flies by. It's such an easy watch. Iswear, I could've watched four more hours of just the nightmare section alone... ugh!!! It was so compelling.If you you're at all interested in where MoS and BvS were taking these characters, Snyder's Justice League is an ambitious and thoroughly enjoyable step in that direction.This is the epic and grand treatment that DCs sprawling universe deserves and it'd be a shame if this is where it ends (a good ending but a cliffhanger of sorts. It's meant to have a sequel, like Endgame was to Infinity War).Bravo Zach Snyder and everyone involved, including the fans who fought to get this film to the screen *clapping*(And again: Cmon WB. Take my money. Give me more Snyderverse. Please!)", "Unbelievable!!": "This is what was supposed to be! Absolutely amazing film!", "I'll be very short...": "...not worth even the time I've spent writing this review. These are not movies any more.

DC or Marvel they have their own place. Come one give the fans what they need and the reward comes by itself. This is how the movie should have been released and the next Justice League 2,3 etc would have guaranteed. I pray WB gives the green light to continue. You can't stop now. Loved it iam back in my childhood", "This redeemed DC for me...": "Their movies have been so-so, with this last one (WW1984) being absolutely hot garbage! I mean serious trash!!!! This was like watching an entirely new and different movie - and I loved it. I sat all 4hrs with my attention held. Thank you Zack Snyder for this movie...well worth it.", "The. Tito a are as stupid as this movie is great.": "DO NOT LOOK AT THE CRITIC REVIEWS. This is a great show. 4 hours wasn't long enough! I didn't know this franchise. Now I am more excited about it than the Avengers. Watch this movie. Enjoy. The user reviews have it right. Watch it.", "The True Justice League Movie": "Awesome!! Had goosebumps watching this movie. So many scenes of Cyborg and Flash, this is a whole new movie. Unlike the previous one , the superheroes do kickass instead of getting beaten. 4 hours long but captivating story and not just that it finishes in such a way that you want to watch the next parts of the movie which we dont know wil ever be made or not but truly Zack Snyder had a great story for the whole DC universe just like the comics and the Game Injustice Gods Among US.", "The movie we deserve": "I don't need to say too much. This masterpiece is definitely 100/10!!!!", "This felt....Complete!": "I would like to start with a literal cyber applause to Zack Snyder. What a guy! A true DC fan. What a beautiful movie. The story connects and fills you up and fills that space up that previous DC movies left behind. I mean come on guys I had literal goosebumps. That epilogue should be called dessert cause that was just delicious! And for people that are saying that its flawed, kindly go back and watch avengers endgames. This movie somehow felt more powerful than that! Amazing Amazing work. I will be smiling when I sleep tonight. Thank you Mr. Zack Snyder, you have made DC fans very very happy :,)", "Zack Snyder to the MAX! Meaning, It REALLY Sucks.": "The first 5 minutes of this movie is a perfect example of the rest.

Thank you, Zack Snyder for the amazing job. This is 1000% better than the one we watch back in 2017. Poetic, beautiful, amazing... I don't have words to describe. Enjoy it, don't spoil it for others. ;)", "Must watch!!": "Love it!!! This is what we needed. I want this to continue the DC film.", "WAY OVERHYPED, not a 10/10": "This film is one of the better DC films in the recent years. But there is no way this film is a 10/10 that everyone is giving it. It is extremely slow paced in the beginning, TO MANY SLOW MOTION SCENES, and weird choses of music. It was also extremely annoying how they played Wonder Woman's song every time she entered the scene.Because of all the great reviews, my standards were set extremely high. The actors chemistry with eachother was way off, To much forced comedy, and NOT ENOUGH DARKSIDE! This is not a 10/10 movie people, I have officially lost all hope when it comes ro DC films. They don't even come close to the standard Marvel films do. And Zack should have left the joker scene at the end out, Jared Leto disgraces the joker role. He was and always will be the biggest joke ever when it comes to playing that role. He might as well spit on Heath Ledger's grave, his laugh is ridiculous and he sounded like Jim Carey when he was speaking. He is nothing close to the joker, same as Jessy E. Playing Lex Luthor. I can't take either seriously.All in all, this was a pretty good movie. The CGI was amazing and there were some refreshing surprise superhero cameos. There were a lot of things that brought this movie down in my opinion, but still one of the better DC movies in the recent years. But no where near the Dark Knight level.", "The shorter version was a mess": "And now? Now it's four hours long and better, but still not very good. DC superhero movies somehow just can't conjure up emotions. No matter how long the runtime: The villain is bland, the heroes don't matter to me, the watcher. It's s mess of computer generated images that are meant to be impressive. But I am 40 years old and no longer impressed by CGI. What I see is a bunch of posing and no heart. I need to like (and therefore root for) my heroes and hate my villains. Otherwise why bother?", "Finally Justice for the Justice League": "Just amazing from the start to the end it will keep you asking for more. Honestly at first the 4hrs runtime might look a bit too much but once you start you will be hooked. I have also seen the theatrical version of the movie but Zack Snyder's version was hands down the best.", "A better cut, not a great movie": "Probably one of the best DC movies since the TDK trilogy but I didn't like a few stuff, almost every scene Snyder try to push the drama to the maximum using the slow motion every time is possible which makes basically the movie a 4 hours length and the final result was a total anti climax! Good movie for sure but not great!", "Better, but still mediocre": "While it is far and away better than the miserable 2017 version in the way of tone, dialogue, and action, Zack Snyder's Justice League ends up suffering from its own self-indulgence. The four-hour runtime starts to wear on you after hour 2 and many of the scenes feel forced in the mix for sparkle instead of substance (the Knightmare scene with Jared Leto's \"new\" Joker and the unnecessary inclusion of Martian Manhunter, in particular). But even with its many flaws, this version of JL makes you realize the most important statement about the film and its place in the DCEU. It is a testament to how poorly Warners has executed their attempt at a DC Cinematic Universe. It gives you glimmers of what could've been if each of the characters was able to get at least one solo movie in before the big-budget team-up, as it's able to flesh out Cyborg, The Flash, and Aquaman a bit more than in 2017. But unfortunately, when you pack what should've been a minimum of six hours of character development into an hour of exposition dumps and dialogue, you're still left short-changed when all is said and done. At the end of the day, it all boils down to this: if they took the time and effort to do it all properly after Man of Steel's passable intro to the universe in '13 (like the other guys in red and white did, starting in '08), this could have been the DC Universe's epic finale akin to the Infinity War/Endgame duo.In short, die-hard DC fans will likely love it, while casual moviegoers won't have the interest or the stamina to endure its mammoth runtime.", "Unexpected format": "A bit surprised when Snyder put it into 4:3 format but the result was satisfying. Too bad WB doesn't make the universe connected to this (too late for now). It can be as big as Marvel if the did this right from the start", "Joss Whedon will never sit as director again! Jared Leto was just horrible!": "Wow what a great cut. This just shows how horrible Joss Whedon's Justice League was. The ending was a bit out of place for some reason. Didnt feel like Snyder's taste for cinematography, especially with Letos horrible performance. Was just so hard to watch. I hope they dont give him another chance.", "Wow, just amazing": "It may be over 4 hours, and I did need a couple of coffee breaks. But what ana amazing movie, best action scenes in any DC movie so far. It's basically the polar opposite of WW 1984.", "best superhero movie": "Marvel weak fanboys cant handle how good this movie is", "Worth staying up 4 hours after midnight for.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is the best DCEU movie I have ever seen. Although some things hold it back, like the hit or miss cgi, and the strange aspect ratio, off acting once or twice, it's a great experience for anyone invested in the comics. It's a more warm and heartful experience than BvS by far, although the stakes are higher this time around, things are definitley more positive. The movie is remarkably engaging, despite being 4 hours long. Cinematography is incredible, however, some of the greenscreens and lighting do hold it back (which is understandable, considering they got all the post production done in a year while covid-19 was still rampant). The music is great, and an improvement over the original score.", "Awesome \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e": "I really loved this movie... though long it is amazing, Zack Snyder is an amazing director...hope he makes movies like this in the future.", "Genius": "The movie was perfect.

Running a 5k in 20 minutes, or running a 10k in 45 minutes?Unfortunately, Snyder's League suffers from the same problems as it's hacked up predecessor. What Marvel did so well (individual character movies that eventually assemble) DC only wishes it could do. Yes, it's a better movie than the 2017 version, just not better by enough to make it worth checking out.Spend your time rewatching Watchmen, or watching Guardians of Gahoole for the first time.", "Spectacular and a Masterpiece by Zack": "It all started three years back on Vero after the awful version of JL by Whedon comes out, a fandom started flooding and breaking the doors of Zack Snyder to release his version/cut, as no fan wanted to see what Joss has done with the epic. We waited three years and today Zack has proved why everyone was right, it's a completely different experience that we wanted to experience before, he brought life to all the characters' arc and stories which we read in comics, top-notch cinematography with spectacular background scores. I can keep going and going to appreciate what Zack had done for us. It's a 10/10 beautiful adaptation and additional storyline added by Chris and Zack where it was necessary.", "Un buen trabajo.": "Justice was done, With the justice league This means well thought out production In the future Be even better By the spectators This will be recognized Justly and respected Why good work will be remembered forever.a required field is missing.", "The greatest movie of all time": "When I saw the movie \"I saw the face of God\" right infornt of me and the soundtracks mama mia so great I want justice league part 2 form zack snyder of course his visionary is far beyond WB and the fight scene are extraordinary and I wish that the movie had more scene and now i want the full sage of the dceu and I want to see what happened to the first Robin (Dick Grayson) plz let zack continue his amazing visionary!!!!!", "shouldve been the only version": "This movie is good, no doubt. Good characters, action, and heart. Everything from the original one is fixed and there is no bad jokes. However, the movie is long, the use of slow-mo seems out of place occasionally, and the first part isn't the most enjoyable. I also enjoy how they show heroes being heroes and using there power for good, like Cyborg giving that women 100,000 dollars at a bank. That was nice. Should've made the original cut. Overall, good movie", "Full of Heart, Full of Action, Once in a lifetime experience!": "Dammit, lets pretend the 2017 never existed. This was not a movie, this was an experience. The 4 hours of my life were totally worth it. The movie has it all, action, heart, fanservice, story literally everything the 2017 version lacked. There were several, not one, moments that'll send chills down your spine. Every character gets equal share of their story. And oh boy Cyborg. I guess Zack really meant when he said he was the \"heart of the movie\". I just hope the Snyderverse gets restored. Highly recommend this movie!", "This is a new movie! Packed with excitement!": "I have no clue how and why did WB let the previous version come out! Even if they would have waiting a few more years for getting this out they would have saved the DC universe! I wish part 2 comes out and so sad that due to previous cut Ben had to walk away!Coming to the movie, the story line finally makes sense. It always did to me cause I am a DC fan but for those who don't know can totally enjoy the movie now!Show casing of the back ground stories of all the characters was amazing, showing team work was amazing (which was missing in the previous movie) and the action was mind blowing. Kudos to the background music as well! Gave me chills! All the Villains good scary and awesome.I wish WB does something amazing here and let Zack make a second one!I mean COME ON! Pls pls pls pls make a petition for this pls.Let's do this", "Justice League Gets Justice.. In 4 LONG Hours": "Zack is a master of his craft, all Heroes in this movie are given their time to shine, Steppenwolf is given true purpose and his motivations are made clear, Blacksuit Superman reveal was iconic, The Flash is actually given a major role that I will not spoil unlike Joss's version AND possible spin-offs and a sequel is perfectly set up here. Zack deserved to finish his movie and WB will not get another cent from me until he is given his respect. I give this movie an 8/10 and for a few reasons cannot go higher. #1 FOUR HOURS. Come on man, you cannot tell me that this couldn't be shortened into 3 at most, you did not earn Endgame level runtime in my opinion and #2 The slow motion.. my GOD what is with the slo mo all the time, Zack?! It isn't cinematic, it isn't beautiful, it's entirely pretentious and the MCU has very little of it FOR A REASON.An 8/10 but a must see if you're a fan of DC, it definitely is the best depiction of the JL to date.", "I wish this is the movie that was in theaters": "I have watched this version at least 4 times. It's an amazing story. I love the fact it takes all of them to conquer the bad guy instead of it just being superman stopping the bad guy and saves almost everyone by himself. I hope if they make a sequel to this movie they will use Zack Snyder instead of Joss.", "A mild improvement on one of the worst superhero movies ever made.": "I am a firm believer that creative freedom is always a good thing. Zack Snyder's Justice League is ultimately a success because it proves that with enough fan pressure, major studios will give directors complete creative control and allow them to make a big-budget four-hour R-rated movie. This isn't a focus-grouped studio-meddled cash grab. This is a director doing exactly what he wants to do, for better or for worse.However, and this is apparently a hot take...Zack Snyder's Justice League is not a good movie.I'll start with the positive. Cyborg and Steppenwolf have a modicum of characterisation now, rather than zero. The awkward, unfunny, tonally inconsistent comic relief quips have all been removed, and the role of awkward, unfunny, tonally inconsistent comic relief has been given entirely to one character.\nHowever, the movie is still built on the utter nonsense from Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. It still has extremely clunky dialogue. Many of the absurd scenes from the 2017 cut are fully intact here. This is a terribly written movie where characters repeatedly say exactly what they are thinking out loud to themselves. This is a movie with hilariously inconsistent physics. This is a movie where the villain looks and sounds like a video game villain, although this time he appears to have come from a PS5 game instead of a PS3 game.This is an ugly movie inexplicably presented in 4:3 aspect ratio for no fathomable reason. Any modern movie usually has a LOT of character and camera movement, and this is even more present in action movies. When you don't film in widescreen, you cut off 30% of the screen. There is no valid stylistic reason to do this. Justice League is not The Lighthouse. I do not understand why Snyder chose to do this for an epic sci-fi fantasy movie.The Snyder Cut is better than the 2017 cut only by virtue of being literally twice as long, but even then at least an hour of the film is dead weight. It manages to plug a few holes in that extra runtime, but a significant portion of this four hour cut is completely redundant. This is not a complicated story, and for some reason it takes four hours to tell it. A movie being long isn't an inherent negative, but Justice League is not The Lord of the Rings. It absolutely does not need to be four hours long.I think overall I admire the fact that Snyder was able to do this. The whole backstory as to how and why this happened is fascinating, and I fully support giving directors the chance to do this in future. I believe that The Snyder Cut is 100% the film Zack Snyder wanted to make. But regardless, Zack Snyder's Justice League is only a mild improvement on one of the worst superhero movies ever made. 4/10.", "Didn't expect much, but goddamn!": "Let me start by saying that even tho i prefer DC over Marvel, i wasn't expecting much. I wasn't a huge fan of BvS so i thought this is gonna be on that level. But i honestly think this is one of the best superhero movies i've seen in a while. It's better than 2017 one in every way. Characters are MUCH better. Not only is there more of them, the ones that were already there are much better than from 2017 movie, especially Steppenwolf, Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg. Even the story is not the same. It was way better and there were quite a few suprises. Action scenes were more fun, intense and engaging. In most of the scenes music made them even better, but in few of them i didn't like that they were just switching from one theme to the other. CGI didn't look great in some scenes but i can forgive that. Overall it's better than the theatrical version in every way, and it's a mustwatch for comic book movie fans.", "4:3 bothered me but the movie was F awesome!": "Even without been able to have big reshoot or finish shooting what Zack Snyder wanted, this movie makes sense! Has logic, Start middle and End. Who said he can't tell stories but only good action scenes? If the studio is forcing you to make 2 movies into 1 and only 2hours long ofcourse it will not be able the director to make a good storyline!\nnow with 4h that btw passed super fast, everything was right!WB needs to their heads out of the sand and make new contracts with all the actors again to continue the storyline! Not spend millions in ww1984 lame writers.Bring back the exact same cast for their individual movies and Justice League 2!#restorethesnyderverse", "I'll start with the bad and end on the good.": "I gotta be honest and frank with this movie because many are hyping it up and too much to be in fact. This is not, I REPEAT, this is not the best comic book movie of all time. This is not the best DC movie. This movie does not fix all of the plot holes of previous DC movies like Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman, and Joss Whedon's Justice League. In fact, if you're not a fan of those movies nor Zack Snyder's work then this isn't the movie for you. Especially for 4 hours.Starting off with THE BAD...There is an overabundance of slow motion sequences that works in some areas, like Flash's running sequences for example, but a lot that doesn't. For example there were instances of slow-mo from every fight sequence to the Amazons encounter with Steppenwolf, Cyborg's football game, flashback of Darkseid's invasion, the entire final battle, the list goes on. I could go on with more examples but the point is that the overuse of slow motion is more style over substance. That works for some people but it doesn't work for me with this movie. If you're tired of the typical plot of a particular group fighting off an alien invasion from taking over/destroying Earth, then don't waste your time. Despite the extended scenes that give more depth it doesn't excuse the simplistic plot that's been done before in other movies like the Avengers movies, Monsters vs Aliens, Independence Day, Pixels, Battle Los Angeles, and live action Transformers movies. One could argue this follows a similar plot to Man of Steel with a space alien trying to terraform planet Earth which requires a McGuffin to do so.With the 4 hour runtime, there are some pacing issues and I felt those 4 hours did drag at times. There were scenes that were unnecessary like the girls singing and sniffing Aquaman's sweater. I kid you not. There's a moment after Aquaman and Bruce Wayne's talk Aquaman takes his sweater off, a group of girls start singing out of nowhere, one girl grabs his sweater and sniffs it. Other pointless scenes that could've been cut were Aquaman saving the fisherman, some of Alfred's scenes, some of Lois Lane's scenes, parts of Cyborg's flashbacks, Commissioner Gordon, and even Martian Manhunter's surprise appearance when he talks to Lois. The point of that scene was to motivate Lois to go back to the Daily Planet but she doesn't for the rest of the movie till Superman comes back to life, thus the scene is merely for the shock value of Martian Manhunter appearing who again appears to talk to Bruce Wayne at the end. The biggest offender of pointless scenes in this movie is the scene everyone kind of hyped up the most. I'm talking about the Knightmare scene with the inclusion of Jared Leto's Joker, Mera, and Deathstroke this time around. That scene could've been cut out and it wouldn't have made the movie any different.A surprising letdown was the soundtrack. People were kind of giving Danny Elfman for his Justice League score and it was okay at best for the short time period he had to complete it for Joss Whedon's version. But Junkie XL's score in Justice League was not as memorable as his previous work on Batman v Superman nor Mad Max: Fury Road. If you're expecting a memorable Justice League main theme like in the animated series, this movie will let you down big time. The only memorable soundtrack moments are during some of Wonder Woman's scenes, Superman's scenes, and Darkseid's brief appearances. The music feels a bit overblown at times that it took me out of the moment during certain scenes much like Man of Steel and BvS did. I recommend listening to \"DC Logos\" by Danny Elfman from the Joss Whedon version. That's as close as you're going to get for a memorable Justice League theme. Shoot even the \"Icky Thump\" by White Stripes and \"Come Together\" by Gary Clark/Junkie XL were more memorable. Those songs would've perfectly fit with Snyder's Cut to be honest.\nThat being said now on to The GOOD...Despite the those problems the movie does set up a good foundation for future movies with the inclusion of Darkseid and the Anti-Life Equation. Casuals won't get it but both comic book fans and Justice League Unlimited cartoon fans will. Steppenwolf gets an upgrade from 1-Dimensional Villain to 2-Dimensional. He has a purpose and is fighting for something. More could've been explored but I'll take it and Steppenwolf does come off as more threatening than the Whedon version. The action scenes got some blood and gore with limbs being chopped off which was a nice addition.The character interaction between the Justice League members was great as always. Both versions of Justice League movies had great character interactions between the heroes. I wished some scenes from Whedon's cut made it to the Snyder Cut such as Flash saying him and Cyborg were \"the accidents\" while digging up Superman's grave. Another scene they should've kept is the team debating whether or not they should bring back Superman with Diana strongly opposing Bruce's plan saying he might turn into another Doomsday. Even the Aquaman sitting on the lasso of truth wasn't on the Snyder Cut which surprised me. Those were genuine character moments I felt should've been left in.Thank god they didn't do any comedic stuff with Batman this time. The Whedon Cut was wrong in having Batman do comedic jokes that didn't work for the Batman character. Thankfully the Snyder Cut changed that. Superman's upper lip is fixed so you don't have to worry about that. Superman doesn't have much of an arc but again it does set up a potential Man of Steel 2 story-line that now Clark is reborn, he's going to live life to the fullest and hopefully be the Superman we all know he can be. I'll even throw in that there's still a possibility of his Superman turning evil since Batman still feels Lois being the key would lead to \"something darker\". Cyborg and Flash do get the most deserved character development seeing this was suppose to be their introduction. Cyborg is more brooding in this version which makes sense considering all that he's been through. No \"booyah!\" catchphrase which is kind of a bummer but again why would he say that after all he's been through in this movie. Flash is good as always. My only issue is his weird running movements haven't changed which goes to show that was a Snyder decision and not a Whedon one. There are creative scenes of both Cyborg and Flash using their powers. The scene where Flash helps Cyborg separate the mother-boxes is pretty impressive.The appearance of Martian Manhunter was a pleasant surprise but I wished he got more involved and helped the League. His appearance will raise questions. The Knightmare Scene despite being unnecessary was a treat to see, only for Jared Leto's Joker finally coming face to face with Ben Affleck's Batman. The dialogue between the two was awesome and I pray there's a Ben Affleck Batman solo movie. Especially since Deathstroke now knows Batman's identity. The scene between Lex and Deathstroke is still there at the end just with Lex giving out Batman is Bruce Wayne instead of saying \"Shouldn't we have a league of our own\".Overall while I reiterate that this not the best comic book movie of all time nor is it the best DC movie, it is a step in the right direction. Let this be the end for Zack Snyder directing comic book movies in general. He's a talented director who can do other genre movies if given the chance. Have someone like James Gunn or the Russo Brothers carry on and properly build what Snyder established. A 3 hour movie would've suffice but I like the movie for what it is. It's good just not as good as people here are making it out to be.", "Art at the Best": "This movie was the best movie of DCEU hands down...beautiful music that gave me goosebumps many many times...if WB dont make this cannon and dont make Zack in charge of the DCEU than its an end for it.", "Just don't understand the hype": "Slow mo after slow mo.

How you introduced the characters into the film, and filled the gaps to questions that I had on the other version, was perfect.", "So much better than the Theatrical/Whedon Cut...": "But that does not mean it was good.\"First, some background on myself. I have two degrees in Geek, movies and comics. I have been movie obsessed for as long as I can remember (as of this writing I am 42 years old, so let us say I have been watching movies fanatically for at least 37 of those years) and I have been an avid comic collector for the past 30 years, with most of my collection being dedicated to DC. When those two mediums come together in a well-crafted way, I feel like I just proved the CAINE/HACKMAN theory by finding \"A Bridge Too Far\" while channel surfing. For the most part, the films of the MCU give me that feeling, as does the first \"Superman\" starring Christopher Reeve and 2/3 of Christopher Nolan's \"Dark Knight Trilogy\".I was lukewarm with the first few films of the Snyder-Verse, I did not hate them outright. I just thought they could be a little brighter and Superman could be, well, more like Superman. Bright and happy and less mopey. I followed the #releasethesnydercut campaign even though I thought it would never come to be and I was genuinely shocked when it worked.This afternoon, I put the movie up on my big screen and my lifelong movie/comic collecting friend came over and we watched it just like it was in a real theatre. For the first 30 minutes or so, we sat there in silence and then something happened and we both broke. Suddenly, it was like we were on The Satellite Of Love and we were being punished for scientific research. It ended up being 3 1/2 hours of us doing MST3K like commentary without the robots.Want to know why this thing is 4 hours long? Because 1/2 of it is in slow motion. I get having scenes with Flash being slowed down, but every action scene? Even some dramatic stuff was running at a slower pace.Is it all bad? No. There were some changes I genuinely liked. But not enough to justify an all new movie. I know some people are going to wonder what I thought was good and what I thought was not. Well, the truth is I found it to be so unremarkable that I really cannot recall any specifics...except the \"Knightmare\" scene. Not only do I think it was unnecessary but the inclusion of Jared Leto's Joker was kind of hysterical! I felt like he was just trying to channel Jim Carrey. As a matter of fact, for a split second I thought that it WAS the MASKed one stepping into the role.So far, I like the changes made to the DCEU that have been made post Theatrical Cut. \"Shazam!\" was a lot of fun, \"Birds Of Prey and The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn\" was totally underrated and I think James Gunn's \"The Suicide Squad\" is going to be a blast. I know a lot of people are going to like this one and they have every right to. I am just not one of them. If WB caves to the fan cries again and does \"Restore the Snyder-Verse\" like I have seen a lot of posters call for, then I may have to bow out for whatever else is to come.", "Great Movie": "It is better then the theatrical justice league. Really what i expected", "Treat For DC Lovers": "A great movie that doesn't disappoint despite the long duration. Just loved it from the beginning till end.", "It is not superior to the first go around": "It is so over the top, I thought Sylvester Stallone was going to pop up and start arm wrestling. I can see why they had to trim the fat. The introductory scene with The Flash is one of the worse I've seen in years. With a 4 hour run time, you can stumble into some decent material. Is this 4 hours(wtf 4 hours really)better, I cannot say that it is. It's so serious, I felt like I was watching a horror movie. I can understand having dramatic aspects but, it is not an action piece, it is a random drama that still does it's best to leave the villains true motivation unexplained. So if you have 4 hours to spare in order to watch the longest movie ever, then go right ahead, or watch the first version which is superior to the over blown 'SNYDER CUT.' I was bored! #justiceleague #justiceleaguesnydercut I suggest they give Christopher Nolan a blank check, in order to craft their universe. It's a comic book movie, and it seems as if sucking all the color, all the campiness, all the humor from the film, is the goal. It does not make the film more enjoyable by making The Flash run in such a goofy manner; making AquaMan so bitter I craved his light hearted attitude from his own film; distorting Batman's voice to the point Christian Bale might cringe; introducing a character that might give Superman a run for his money but, not allowing him to fight during an anti-climatic Power Rangers like battle to vanquish the villain. I cannot stand films that are created for sequels. The arrogance. Make the movie you have the best it can be, and if it is good, a sequel will be warranted.", "Vastly better than the original version": "This cut of the film improves every aspect of the original. What's amazing about it is you could almost freeze frame any section of the movie and turn it into a great screen saver. This turns comic book scenes into live action very similarly to the way the movie \"300\" did many years ago.The style used here has created a classic that will be popular for a lengthy period of time. I think this is a value aspect that Hollywood has entirely forgotten as they look purely at how it performs over a very short period of time rather than producing material that can last the test of time. This revised film will be one of those that is watched many years after it was made again and again.", "4-hours long Masterpiece by Snyder": "When you will see the Snyder's JL, you will know, you are a fan. For Autumn, For Zack and For the ardent DC fans, this movie does justice to all.#restorethesnyderverse is the new chant.

A 4-hours long masterpiece is what this movie is.Action sequences, Awesome music, brilliant synchronisation of characters. All in all, you will Love it.", "More but not more insightful": "My problem with the Zack Snyder cut is the same as the Matrix reboots. The CGI is ungrounded so the battles that are supposed to be epic, end up being boring. Nothing has any sense of reality. I get that it is supposed to be a super-hero movie and not Lawrence of Arabia, but the characters' motivations see to change depending on the need of the individual scenes. There are big moments, but none of them have any sense of pay off.", "Screw Warner Brothers": "WB needs to give Zach Synder all creative control of all things DC.

For a four hour movie I was engaged, I loved the chemistry between the team and stephenwolf (however your spell it) was more fleshed out finally.

Even after knowing the plotline with key elements, no where I felt bored watching this 4hr long movie. That's an important factor considering how good the movie is. Another important thing about the movie is, this movie connects all the dots unanswered from previous DC movies and paves way for future movies (hopefully).Pros:\nActionStoryCharacterization of certain characters.DarkseidCons:\nSome slow motion montage shots can be avoided as they didn't add much to the story line.Steppenwolf wasn't that intimidating.Overall, the movie was enjoyable and serves the justice after the debacle of theatrical version.\nPS: Aspect ration wasn't an issue after like few minutes.

I have seen the previous Joss Whedon version it was not great not as good as Avengers(2012) but what Snyder does is take us beyond and creates possibilities that were not shown in a Superhero movie till now.For instance\nFlash coming to save the world.Cyborg leaving behind his stamp.Wonder Woman being her truest self.Superman being Superman when it was needed the most.Aquaman leaving behind his past and saving the world.Batman,.. burring his own guilt and moving towards an uncertail future no matter what!!!Matian Manhunter Coming out of the possible self imposed exhile after the probable destruction of his planet.

I'm certain we can all agree on that. Characters given time to be fleshed out. Scenes flow better. Story line actually makes sense. Steppenwolf big improvement looks better & shows valid motive. Final scene actually sets up brilliantly leaving you wanting more.The not so good is something that just can't be ignored. Biggest issue is that the 1st hour 45 is all intro & character building for Aquaman, Flash & Cyborg. None of this would have been needed if WB had focused on their individual movies before doing a JL movie. The movie would have flowed so much better like Infinity War if the only character focus was on Steppenwolf & Darkseid. But what's done is done WB finally realised you can't rush a team up movie cramming in the whole lot.There a still a lot unnecessary scenes that are just not needed & have 0 impact on the story line. You will notice Aquaman scenes being the 1st offender.Music is good throughout but ruined by over playing. I'm looking at Wonder woman mainly. Its not her bad ass 2017 theme either its a rather annoying wailing song that gets played far too much often out of place. Thankfully Superman's music is still fantastic & appropriate.Also slow motion over used a bit?To sum up, too many characters shoe horned in & unnecessary scenes hold this back.

It exists and is now here to stay. Now let's come to the movie for me this movie was *9.5/10*. First I would like to refer to some problems I heard from the people that watched this movie.1- Movie's CGI is bad.In my humble opinion , this was the single best CGI movie I had watched in recent times. CGI for Darkseid and Steppenwolf are elite level CGI. I don't know what people can expect after this beautiful and realistic CGI.2-Aspect ratio.Let me tell you the usual 16:9 aspect ratio cuts most of the information of video you can see. ZSJL 4:3 ratio displays tons more of information in a frame which helps you enjoy the movie even more and yes it is IMAX friendly too.3-Same movie.Guys if you say this is the same movie then sorry I have to break it to you that you know nothing about direction, editing and storytelling. Also about 70 percent of the movie was already shot when Zack left and Whedon used that to make his cut. It isn't the same movie in any regard be it storytelling, direction and characters arcs. Also the first movie didn't have darkseid I mean the main villain.4-Long movie.Yes the movie is long. But when you see , it has 6 parts which you can watch with having breaks.The movie needed to be long because stories of cyborg, flash, aquaman, superman's revival, batman's guilt and wonderman's realization needed time.Now what I liked about the movie.1- Wonderwoman entry sequence.Hell it was brilliantly done. After WW 1984 I was so disappointed by what they did to WW. But Zack reminded us of what WW is and what she can do.Kudos to the music team of WW.2-Cyborg helping that broke lady.Nothing to say just nothing to say. You have to watch the movie to get the feelings that I got from that scene.3- Parallel of Lois lane and cyborg.Scene when superman is being revived by Cyborg and flash and scene cuts to Lois who is standing in front of superman statue showing the relationship between technology and science being used by cyborg and flash and on the other hand pure organic love by lois lane. Brilliant scene.4- Batman saying This is Alfred and I work for him.That scenes is so so wholesome that I am finding myself unable to express it in words. People watching batman from childhood can relate.5-Superman stopping that Steppenwolf Axe like its nothing.Man that scene showed why mother boxes were afraid of him. Boom my man even said Not impressed. Destroyed Steppenwolf like he was some sort of toy. Peak superman Peak Peak. My adrenaline was off the charts during that sequence.6- Barry's time travel.People are usually only talking about the last time travel sequence. But when flash and cyborg are reviving Superman by motherbox barry becomes a bit late so he runs faster than light to rewind the time and gives motherbox that electrical pulse it needed to be activated. Secondly that last time travel sequence which was now or never, barry didn't fail and again rewinded the time but this time not for a few second but for creating a new different timeline.7- Aquaman killing Steppenwolf by his trident.Man that scene was pretty awesome and gave closure to the movie.8- Every darkseid scene.Scenes where he say All of the existence shall be mine and Ready the armada we will use the old ways are sooooo awesome. It was dream for us DC boys to see live action Darkseid which just got fulfilled in an epic way.There are many other scenes too but I mean majority of you shouldn't have even read this whole review so I will end this review just by saying the last sentence :\n\" THIS WAS THE BEST LIVE ACTION DC MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED \"", "Better than Whedon's": "But still flawed.There's three references to Green Lanterns (two are shown, one is mentioned), yet they shoehorn in Martian Manhunter with two bizarre cameos?Batman/Bruce still mentions his dream where Flash warns him that \"Lois is the key,\" but nothing ever happens with it unlike in Whedon's cut where we discover it's not a dream but actually Flash time-traveling. Very strange choice to keep those 3 seconds of dialogue that go nowhere.The Joker scene is truly awful. What a cringey, autistic-sounding laugh. Ugh.", "Much needed justice...": "Unbelievable from start to finish, this is justice league, not the last abomination from Joss Whedon, I lost all hope for DC after his shower of crap, but this has fully restored all... by far the best DC movie made.\nWe need a sequel from Zack Snyder and Joss needs to be stacking shelves at his local supermarket!!!", ".....and Justice for all.": "THE WAY IT'S MEANT TO BE PLAYED.Snyder's cut is the true Justice League.

We need more !!:-}", "A Masterpiece!!!": "My only gripe is......... that we might never get part 2!Oh and the weird screen format. Less CGI to do? I got used to it fast and was a minor hinderance if at all, but it was an odd choice.Music, fight scenes, cgi (especially on Steppenwolf, he looks so cool) were all flipping amazing. The story was also coherent and there was character development, it definitely helped that it was a long movie. I loved the length, it basically turned into two movies... I really wish it was longer though!I never saw the Whedon version so I came in with high expectations and I was met with AWESOMENESS!", "I prefer this to anything Marvel/Disney have done": "Title says it all really.

I put efre watching godzilla with 8 mins of cgi monsters instead of seeing gaming graphics 20 years old like that one\nAnd now why I watched it, it was obvious for Batman who asked a woman to lead a superhero team with two teenagers and drunken aquaman, now I know why AFLEK canceled his reboot for batman, cause the image we want from him In BM vs LSM will not be on da screen with such writers and director and rest of the cast\nThx God I watch this for free and it will my last time even to see it, hopefully that they will stop spamming trailers", "Balance of the universe restored": "Brings back some of the good feelings one experienced watching man of steel.Hats off to Zack Snyder and R.I.P Autumn.", "Simply awesome": "Definately one of the best movies ever made.

Starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, and Ray Fisher, it's not only an improved version of a mediocre original but a new and fantastic film on its own.Shortly after the events of \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) along with his ally Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), decide to form a team of heroes after the latter is informed that the extraterrestrial conqueror Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) has returned to Earth to lay waste to its inhabitants. This team, in addition to Bruce and Diana themselves, consists of Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a superhuman with aquatic abilities, Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), a young man who can move at superfast speeds, and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a former athlete reconstructed with cybernetic abilities to manipulate technology. With Steppenwolf and his army quickly gaining power, the team must learn to put aside their personal differences to work together to end this threat before everything is gone.Throughout the history of cinema, the \"Director's Cut\" of certain films has provoked varying reactions among audiences. Sometimes they can add a whole new perspective to a movie that the studio executives butchered in post-production (e.g. \"Blade Runner\") while other times they may ruin what many fans of the original loved most about them in the first place (e.g. the \"Star Wars\" Special Editions). This long requested cut of Zack Snyder's original vision of 2017's \"Justice League\" is thankfully in the former category and was absolutely worth the four year long wait. Here, Snyder delves deep into superhero mythology, comparing them to how people in ancient times viewed gods and titans. This gave the heroes more depth in the story, essentially elevating them to this high status with the magnitude of the responsibility they have for protecting the Earth. Naturally, this differs greatly from what Joss Whedon did in the 2017 film, where he clearly sought to make it more bright and colourful like the earlier Marvel films. While I usually have no problem with light-hearted superhero fun, I never thought Whedon's vision worked properly with what the DC Extended Universe had already established for itself up to that point. Fortunately, after much pressure by fans, we now have a more appropriate interpretation of the story the way the director had always intended.All of Snyder's visual trademarks are here, from the slow-motion action scenes to the striking cinematography that resembles a work of art. However, these pale in comparison to what I believe is the best thing about him returning to the director's chair: he has listened to feedback. One thing that Snyder has frequently come under fire for is his inability to tell a story without overloading the film with CGI and scenes of action that overstay their welcome. In this cut, he keeps moments like this to a minimum until about halfway through, giving the film some room to breathe as he sets the tone and properly introduces us to the characters. Additionally, this version is considerably more violent than the original, with severed limbs and blood being common during major battles. None of it was too graphic, but it is definitely something that separates this film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Another thing that works in this film's favour is its runtime. At just over four hours long, Snyder's cut allows us plenty of time to understand the importance of bringing all of these heroes together to fight off the looming threat of annihilation, dividing the story up into six chapters and an epilogue. Of course, four hours will sound off-putting to many who lack that kind of time, but to those who are interested, the film is edited well enough that it feels like you are watching a shorter film. As I said in my review of \"The Irishman\" (a film almost as long), if people are willing to binge an entire season of a show in one day, then a film of similar length shouldn't be too much trouble.Something else I complained about in the original film was the lack of character development for the newly introduced heroes. This time, they receive the most attention of all, with Cyborg being a major focus in the story. Ray Fisher finally has the time to shine in the role as we see Victor Stone's tragic backstory in more detail as well as some genuinely emotional moments with his family members. All of this was quickly glanced over in Whedon's cut so it was nice to actually get to know this character better before we see him join the rest of the group. I also thought The Flash was used better too, with Ezra Miller adding some brief but humorous comic relief whenever it was needed. Even Steppenwolf was better developed, going from a generic CGI-rendered villain to a more rounded character with a believable reason as to why he is carrying out such evil deeds. But perhaps best of all, this film actually has the six heroes fighting as a team of equals, as opposed to an overpowered Superman with a poorly CGI-removed moustache effortlessly defeating the bad guys with some friends on the side.Although the DC Extended Universe is still in a messy state, Snyder's original vision of the first live-action team-up of these iconic superheroes has gone from a curious hypothetical to a reality we never knew we needed. It just goes to show that if studios and filmmakers listen to the constructive feedback of their audience, then they will reap the benefits of their labour. If only a certain director of a particular series of films set in a galaxy far, far away had done the same many years ago.I rate it a solid 9/10", "The Movie as we expected it to be 3 years ago.": "This is my live review, paused at almost every chapter break:An hour in, almost an hour of new footage. I am so happy today. The buildup has been light years beyond the other movie. Scenes that were left in have so much added to them. Things that didn't make scene have purpose and meaning. Elaborate origin of the motherboxes. It's beautiful.Right about the half way point. This movie has so much more heart and soul to it. I don't want to spoil anything, but Cyborg has so much more depth to his story. He has so many more reasons than previously given to be shut away from the world, trauma overbearing him at all times, it is travesty that they have been locking this movie away from DC fans.It's so nice to see so much of Steppenwolf's motivations and devotion to evil. It's nice to see The Flash and Batman not being buffoons in addition to pulling their weight along with Cyborg's efforts when the team first meets steppenwolf. This is The League almost complete.Important to note: this movie is in chapters, so while it's one solid film, there are points where you can pause/stop and resume at your pleasure. It covers so much that was scrapped, and nullified meaning. They underplayed the importance of the mother boxes so much. So much of cyborg's abilities thrown away. Makes sense why he knew how to mess with the nightcrawler. The utter need for Superman over the want of more help.So much faith, hope, heart and soul were pried out of this movie. Not accidentally, very carefully. So many half scenes left in that very obviously lost all of their context. THIS IS THE MOVIE I WANTED TO BRAG ABOUT SUPPORTING.I'm amazed at how the team came in after Snyder left, had this movie as a road map and managed to strip it down and change the true outline of the film. If WB would have just allowed Zack's vision to play out, they would have realized how Batman Vs Superman's dark, gritty, hopeless undertones were necessary for this movie to bring FAITH AND HOPE forward to a world so broken to a team left with nothing. If you have ever been a DC Comics fan, or a fan of any of the Justice League, this epic tale is for you. Treat yourself to this film. I'm too close to fairly rate it, but to me, it is perfect.", "Up there with infinity war and endgame": "Barring Martian Manhunter ruining a great scene between Lois and Martha, and all the tacked-on stuff at the end which was an audition for JL2 (basically the whole epilogue), this was a visual feast and a masterpiece. It was epic in scale, like an odyssey. Felt more like Lord of the Rings than a superhero movie. So many scenes stick in my mind: Wonder Woman suspended in mid-air, throwing the bomb, the FLASH being the flash (saving Iris and \"your son was the best\"), Cyborg \"I'm not broken\", Superman v the League and \"I'm not impressed\", and Batman making up for his lack of powers with gadgets and leadership. Fantastic. Leagues better than the painful JL2017.", "Pretty terrible": "I like Henry and Gal as people, but this is superhero story telling at its worst.I hope they stop giving zack these projects.This is a completely tone deaf and lack luster interpretation of some of DCs cooler material on their classic characters.Even if you dont like comics, I promise, cracking an old DC graphic novel will be far more rewarding, and more viscerally exciting than this pile cgi garbage.", "Worst movie of this year from big name.": "Literally nothing good about this movie.Stupid story, stupid script, terrible cgi, obnoxious dialogues that make zero sense whatsoever.It's filled with \"fillers\" to stretch it to four damn hours.

I'm glad the Victor Stone and Clark Kent scenes were more impactful and had more of a deeper meaning and connection.There was a lot of scenes that were goosebump moments and I enjoyed them deeply. This movie was one of the best that Snyder created, truly a masterpiece from what we got from 2017. Can't wait to see whats next for Snyder.My most favorite scene from the movies:The Flash rescuing Iris\nThe Flash going into the Speedforce\nSuperman arriving to the fight\nCyborg connecting to the cubes\nWonder Woman Bank Scene\nBatman doing his thing\nAquaman after rescuing the fisherman.", "Useless": "Is that a musical? 4 hours of non stop slow motion effect.", "Wow! This was such an entertaining movie!": "This was a wonderful movie. So much better then the version we saw in 2017. So glad Zack Snyder decided to finish his cut and release it. Looking forward to the next movies from him. Yes, it was 4 hours long but there is so much action in it, it kept me on the edge of my seat the majority of the movie. A Must See for sure!", "The amazing zack snyder": "Zack snyder's justice league is an amazing , we Saw how much the cut dark it really was , that's what made it one of the most strongest superheroes movies ever , the cinematography was good , the fighting so and the story of the characters , CGI was totally good and everything else was just like the others anyway", "It's definitely better": "This version doesn't fix the fact that the story of Justice League is mostly generic(mainly because of its villian).\nYou try to assemble a team people say no but then come around the moment it becomes personal. But there isn't much of learning to be a team here which helps us know the characters better.\nBut with the extra runtime we do get to explore each character individually a lot longer which makes us care about them more then the original where we couldn't understand cyborg's internal battles and actions.\nThe editing on the original was also quite bad scenes were slipping by without much impact or understanding. Also at places the movie was confused is it serious movie? Or is it an \"entertaining\" movie with silly jokes. All of that was obviously gone, making the whole thing cohesive.\nMy issue is that it also ended up having scenes that weren't as important it felt like Snyder wanted to throw in everything they shot for the movie so while the story was still quite simple and straight forward it kept on going a lot longer then needed. It could have been a 3:15h to 3:30h movie and still achieved everything it did. But I guess a movie released on fan demand should show everything that they have heard about over the last two years.", "It makes you want more": "better character back storiesmore emotionalhumour but not in a cheesy wayA Villain that has depth and explains his motivationsfurther proves a point of why Henry Cavill need a separate superman movieenjoyable 4 hours and better action sequences", "All Hail 'The Boss' Zack Snyder": "The hype was just real, it was tremendous. The movie had heart and soul and each and every moment was mesmerizing. Visuals were like an art. Storytelling was very much gripping and junkie XL my man, gave some memorable score which gives goosebumps.\nCharacter arcs of all the characters were superb specially Cyborg's, as Snyder said he's the heart of the movie, he is the heart of the movie. All that matters now is #RestoretheSnyderverse.", "Entertainment but cheesy somewhat": "Seek entertainment ? Get entertainment. Remove cheesy parts though...", "This is the Justice League film we should have got": "After four long years of requesting and waiting for The Snyder Cut, it's finally here and it's surprisingly good.Zack Snyder's Justice League shows Batman and Wonder Woman recruiting The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to save the world from Steppenwolf, Darkseid and their army of Parademons.Zack Snyder finally unleashes his true vision for the Justice League film in a four hour epic. As someone who isn't a fan of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I actually enjoyed this film and can say it's the best Snyder superhero film I've seen so far. After comparing this with Joss Whedon's Justice League, it amazes me how much was changed and how little influence Snyder had on the 2017 version. This is the true Justice League film we should have gotten and I'm happy Snyder was able to bring it out to the public. The four hour runtime is very long but I didn't really feel it. Some scenes could have been cut out but the pacing was enough to not make the film drag or feel rushed. I don't think it's entirely justified though. If this whole universe was actually planned out better then we could've learned the origin stories of Cyborg and The Flash before rather than having to do it in this film. However, I really liked what they did with Cyborg in particular. From being the most boring character in the 2017 film, Cyborg is actually the heart and soul of this film and not only did Ray Fisher do a great job but I cared about him a lot more and was one of the best parts of the film. The Flash is developed more also. For a Synder film, this has more comedy than you would expect. It's definitely more toned down than Whedon's cut which I appreciate but I still found a lot of The Flash's jokes cringey.This is definitely Zack Snyder's film. We're back to the dark and muted colour palette that's cohesive with the rest of the DCEU films. Steppenwolf was extremely weak in the 2017 film but here we understand more about him and why he's doing what he's doing. The design looks way more menacing and he seems more of a threat in some of the action scenes. The action scenes are much better especially the final battle which was so much fun to watch. I liked how smooth the camerawork was considering the amount of shaky cam Snyder tends to use. Although, there were some points throughout where the CGI looked really bad. A couple scenes with Cyborg looked very fake and I could tell they used a green screen. Clearly more work should have gone into that aspect as it was all I could focus on during some scenes. The Wonder Woman theme was overused. It would have been fine if it was used sparingly but it's in nearly every scene with Wonder Woman or the Amazons. There is a significant amount of slow motion as well. The slo-mo scenes with The Flash were great but the rest weren't necessary. I didn't mind the 4:3 aspect ratio but I'm not sure of the purpose behind that choice.Altogether, I liked Zack Snyder's Justice League. There is a vast improvement here in terms of the characters and the overall quality. I still have problems with it and it's not amazing by any means but I'm extremely glad Zack Snyder got his unencumbered vision out and we were all able to witness it. Some may like it more than other but we can all agree it's FAR better than the 2017 film.", "Uniting of superheroes": "Thank you for Zack synder for giving the justified goosebump blockbuster movie. All heroes nailed in their performance. I give 10 without bitterness.", "My new number one DC movie !": "I can't believe how different the movie is.Ray Fisher as Cyborg was awesome.All New Gods are perfection. (amazing voices and a perfect horror atmosphere)I really enjoyed music by Junkie XL.The Flash and his scene in third act is nuts !Aquaman and Wonder Women had some cool moments and perfect character arc.Batman, Superman are small part of the movie, but they both inspire these new heroes in diff ways.PS: I really enjoyed Jared Leto as Joker more !And lets hope there will be more from this Snyder Verse, because his JL was one of best DC movies ever !", "A great experience!": "Without a doubt, this version of the film far improves on the 2017 release. The characters are more developed, heroes and villains have clear motivations, epic scenes everywhere, and a soundtrack that will stick in your head for days. The film is the rebirth of characters that were mired in darkness in previous films. Now, they are convinced that they can be better, and that they must make the most of this new opportunity. I don't know what they were thinking when they decided to delete some of the best scenes from the film. Zack Snyder's Justice League is a full-fledged superhero movie.", "All hail King Zack Snyder!!!!!": "That was MOTHER F!*%#NG BREATH TAKING!!!!

Please please please make more!!!", "One of the best superhero movies to date": "I don't particularly love superhero films and I especially did not care for prior DC movies like Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, Aquaman, etc. With that said: this cut of Justice League is absolutely fantastic and I'm so very pleasantly surprised.Strong script, good characters, a gritty tone, great photography, solid direction and solid narrative timing are but a few of the many great qualities of this film. This truly stands out to me from other superhero films, which tend to have a more pop theme and generally lighthearted tone.Clocking in at 4 hours, you'd think this would be too long, but no. At least not for me. I enjoyed every minute and I'm happy to say that I look forward to the next.", "I can finally say It's a great film": "One word , Justice league was a great movie. I didn't like the original one. But this one was so much and more than better. Great story telling and narrative by Zack Snyder. Great character backstory. Awesome action. All the cast did an amazing job and wonder woman was had ass. Ezra Miller was fantastic as flash. But I'm sad that it won't continue though, because Warner Brothers have been screwing up DC. I hope disney will buy DC someday. And make it right", "What we should strive for!": "A extravagant redesign of a already awesome idea, giving each character's storyline a greater depth. All time best DC production, the only problem was that the length of unnecessary scenes Spoiler alert (such as the girls praising aqua man.) I would have seen it multiple times in theater if Covid wasn't a issue. I'd recommend comparing the lesser movie to this masterpiece, because seeing is believing. For future DC projects, I would want Zach to play a role in making it with the brilliant Patty Jenkins. Affleck should return to the role for at least heroic send off because this film series including BVS Snyder cut should continue in a grand finale.", "Hated The Flash and Did Not Get to See Enough of Steppenwolf": "The portrayal of The Flash was the worst it could have been.Steppenwolf is a great villain.

Snyder clearly had / has a vision for his movies and the story he wants to tell - as evidenced by his Director's cut almost always being better than the theatrical cut.

Yes it is superior to the theatrical cut but is still not a very good movie. Not as terrible as Batman v Superman either, ZSJL is an OK movie. And for a movie to hold someone's attention for 4 hours, just OK is not good enough.It's not worth your time unless you are a die hard fan of Zack Snyder.

Unexchangeable\"": "That's where I was at 3hrs 36 minutes where I started typing this review, and I was feeling the same way about this movie.It is far too long. For example, I don't care about the 10 minutes explaining how one hero's mother has an accident and the related difficulties with the father who had nothing to do with the issue - just let her be dead and we can all fill in the blanks as we wish.It starts slowly, and ends poorly and slowly with some extended Epilogue. The middle is pretty good, with excellent CGI throughout. Soundtrack is well chosen.One of the few comedic moments questions what Batman's powers are - \"I'm rich\", explaining his basic uselessness compared to the true superheroes.I guess if you know and like these characters this movie may provide an extensive explanation of their back-stories and motivations. I have a casual interest in them, and only the robotic cyborg Victor was new or interesting.While typing out this review I've watched the last 20 minutes, took the battery out of a smoke detector that was going off randomly, and used the bathroom.

C. is here, Just like the Dark Knight series, It gets connected to your heart. Fantastic made, Awesome Camera Work, Just Loved it. This is the complete package of the Justice League.", "A review from an \"outsider\". The trip from stupid, to void, annoying and finally silly.": "Let me give my opinion about this movie as a movie viewer, not as a fan of the superheroes universe (I don't buy comics, etc), and without having a fresh memory of the 2017 movie (bad movies tend to be forgotten, right?).This movie is awful.This movie might be better than the 2017 cut, but still that doesn't make it a good movie. And just by comparison I will not rate it good or bad. Since when do we rate movies that way? There are tones of good movies that exist by their own, with their own weight and meaning, and those will remain in our memories and even be part of our culture, and change the way we talk and communicate to others.So, the issues:As a whole the movie is extremely long. And I don't mind long movies if the story is worth the time. But here there is no story in a lot of minutes. There is only slow paced (really, slow motion) intros and outros. Yep. Almost every transition from one scenario to another is first an outro of the previous point, and then an intro to the next one. There is not a single clean straight cut and move one between scenarios. And it's long because every single punch is thrown in slow motion.\nIt's long also because we learn via examples (the movie has a silly good-guy bad-guy logic repeating all through) that no matter how well crafted a villain plan is, the power of the hero will beat it. So why do I have to care about the bad guys? If they are empty, flat and dumb, I don't fear them. No fear, no stress, no emotion,... time stops.Also, the higher in the chain of command the lower the voice, it seems. So it's kinda funny when the bad monster is shown to be someone else pawn, because that other bad monster must have an even lower tone voice. So it's like a contest of who is deepest. I couldn't focus on what they were saying really, i was surprised how low my ears can pick up things. Next bad chief may speak in such a low pitch that maybe dogs will follow him, but not humans I tell you.So the entire purpose of the bad monster is to bring three cubes together to make a large one and bang earth, as he has done a hundred thousand times before. While this is huge, as a single line of motivation is quite shallow. I mean, yeah, it sounds big and bad, but for the movie to connect with the random viewer there should be an unfolding, a presentation, a sort of pitch or justification of why, what are the drivers, the motifs? There are non, besides the apparent willingness of destruction or like a very ancient redemption that would make sense for someone deep inside their mind. But not to a random viewer.\nAlso, the bad monster has a legion of fighters (the human sized cockroaches). There is a problem here: the legion is useless. It's purpose it's only to fill time and screen while someone else does X, or other goes from A to B. These pawns are everywhere but accomplish nothing. I have not fear them yet that they are shown as just blurred cannon-fodder. They have the same face, they do the same growling and noises, they do nothing, though they take a lot of time. I think the great achievement is to flesh wound the flash (without consequences indeed).\nThink about the orcs and goblins in the LOTR movies, they talk, they discuss, they show hunger and pain, they have tiny plot goals that can drive changes in the major order of things (what if they eat the prisoners?). But here in this movie? nothing.\nSo, long scenes here and there, villains that does not represent anything I can attach to...The the heroes: they are flat again. And we have the same character in three different faces: a grumpy disturbed decadent hero that seems to have deep reasons to be grumpy disturbed and down, yet the storyteller doesn't tell because the growling is enough.\nThe the sound: repetitive. repetitive. repetitive. Is it only me that I noticed that EVERY TIME wonder woman act, there is a sudden music silence and a female voice singing ahhhaaahhhaaaahhh...? same thing, same tone, same pitch, over the 4 hours? would not someone find this stupid at first, then later void and finally annoying? I was about to turn the sound off for a second every time that started, though it was funny in the end.But let's touch the rock bottom of this movie. The what-the-f-shallowest point. The worst coming to worst: Superman.\nBasically, the entire movie spins around the concept that the only capable saviour is Superman. But he is dead. So they have to revive him. But once he is back from the dead he is confused and aggressive. That should be the highlight of the movie. It should be a slap in the face to all of the present heroes. It should be the desperation after the last hope is not only lost, but playing against you.\nWell... in a 4 hours movie they exploit that for a few seconds, without no damage or consequences, because right there is the girl that tames the ferocity of the confused Superman. Do they then at least exploit the eternal love? the re-encounter of two soulmates that have been tragically been apart? Nope. Superman grabs her and takes off, and we don't follow them until we are back to them in the fields, were a butterfly is tickling Superman fingers (is that a reference to a censored sexual heavy metal catch up?).Two last things:What are these mixed scenes at the end? what do they represent? who is this people? How am I supposed to digest the 3h55m previous portion of the movie if the last 5 min are random plots and unknown characters bringing it on? What's the point, man? seriously... let me tell you that: If I go and have dinner, i have first, second course, then dessert, then sweet and over. A movie is not different than that. So after the guys revive superman, and fight together, and superman does its thing and helps defeat the bad guys, and the bad bad guys promises to come back, etc. then it's over, the movie it's over. The End. Roll in credits and goofs and funny relief via outtakes and move on.\nBut no, we get sips of other movies, pieces of future or parallel plots that are sour and stiff. How can I swallow the ending of one movie where they have just saved the world, to suddenly care about an unknown ninja talking about killing the less relevant fighter (Batman)?.It does not make sense.I give it a 2, because in comparison the 2017 movie got a 1. And yeah, in comparison, it was worse.I could continue but I have to get back to my real life. Ciao.", "The only version that should have existed.": "If you are a person who is new to the DC Universe this movie is the perfect gateway. You are introduced and given all the needed information on the characters in a way that is easily digestible.The story is immaculately executed, with no unnecessary information and nospace filling scenes. Although the run time of the movie was over 4 hours it doesn't feel that way because it draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It has you craving for more of Zach Snyder's Justice League unviverse even after the final scenes. I believe that this should have been the only version of Justice League to be released and I hope to see more of what Mr Snyder has in store for us.", "Best super hero movie": "Great movie. Without stupid jokes. I can see the real DC universe in this movie.", "Bloated but surprisingly good....sometimes": "I wouldn't recommend this. It's overly long and surprisingly boring. Admittedly this is far superior than the Justice League that was released a few years back. I did enjoy this much more than the Avengers but it left me wanting more. The positive reviews hyped the film up like it was a masterpiece...or the second coming of Jesus. Well, it's neither of those but I expect people to treat it as such as more people watch it. If this was the film that was released a few years ago, Avengers would've had stiff competition but Warner Bros consistently drops the ball. Maybe if they let their directors actually direct, we can get higher quality DC films. Now, if you watched the first Justice League and was left disappointed, this will erase any doubt you may have had in your head about DC. Why the one star? The hype ruined it for me as it did with Joker. I also wanted more for less. It's 4 hours long and my attention span for most movies is 1 hr and 20 mins. Rarely do I finish a movie in one sitting but I did. The film will sometimes grab a hold of you and not let go but when it does let go you don't even notice it so you continue to watch it. I recommend you watch this with family and friends.", "Wish WB would listen to us fans!": "The movie was amazing for me, as a reader of comics in the 80s 90s, and till now. I felt that the other justice league from 2017, was confusing and made no sense and very fragmented. Also with going with the R rating like Deadpool, so much better way to expand on characters with more grittiness. This vision was so good have watched it twice now, and wish could see Zack Synders full vision for this DCEU! Like Kevin Feige, Zack brought a great expanses story and Easter eggs to tie this DC universe, that could have changed the game for DCEU. I hope WB stops trying to maker to everyone, like little Kids, it a new area of story telling, take a risk make it R and make it right ! Enough of my rambling! On that note, definitely watch only the Syder cut justice league and prior watch the batman vs Superman extended cut that's R rated as well ties togther so good!", "Is this even the same film?": "We all know what Justice League was, and even more what it wasn't. We keep wondering why DC keeps getting it so wrong, when Marvel is on a roll (Nolan Trilogy and Wonder Woman not included).But my goodness here is the ensemble film we deserve! With double the running time, a complete re-edit and a complete difference in tone and pace, this is what Justine League should have been in the first place.I swear it's not a shadow of the same film.", "Horribly Boring Extremely Longer Version of The Original": "The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I love Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.

I only got through the first hour and 15 minutes.", "Movie worth the watch": "After the years of waiting, it was worth the watch. The original release was a disappointment compared to this. The movie finally made sense, with scenes moving in a sequence and a flow and the storylines making sense. With no large darkness to the picture and appropriate lighting and overall each character getting enough screentime and plot explanation. Finally made the character look like Heroes / Heroines. This should have been released in the first place, could have built into further movies and further timelines.", "What the OG movie should have been like": "This movie is everything Josstice League wasnt. The story is the same but is handled better. The characters now actually get development and are enjoyable to watch. The action scenes are better, you now care for the characters because the stakes do feel big this time. The one problem this movie has is that its long as hell without the need for that duration, take out all the slow motion and re-edit some scenes for them to be shorter and it would have been a 10/10 because it is that good, but the runtime does make you feel geeting old while watching it.", "Justice is served to snyder and DC fans": "I was waiting for snyder cut for the last 2 years. Snyder is one filmmaker whose films are like slow poison. Be it mos, watchmen,bvs or sucker punch.Though the theatrical version was watchable but forgettable, once you hear the behind the scenes story and well aware of Snyder's filmmaking techniques , your blood boils and hatred increases towards josstice league as wb executives robbed an epic film which you could witness 4 years back.When the snyder cut was officially announced last year, it became my most anticipated film of 2021. Does snyder cut live up to its hype? Is it better than the josstice league? Would it be a sensation if it has released back in 2017? Lets check out.The plot is exactly the same. But its the execution that it makes it totally different from the theatrical version. Snyder is an amazing visual storyteller and in justice league he presented the film with lot of care just like caring a baby. When he got the freedom to make this film he put his best and maximum for the fans. All the characters are well fleshed out. Snyder knew very well that non comic book readers won't know about flash, aquaman and cyborg. So he gave all three of them a detailed backstory especially cyborg who is the heart of the film(no wonder ray fisher turned against the studios). Flash is given an heroic scene in the final battle instead of pushing a truck in whedon cut. Another improvement is its villain steppenwolf. While in 2017 version he was a pain in your eyes, in this one he was an treat to your eyes with better cgi and spikey armour. He is in this like an antihero and I felt a sympathy for him.I loved the action scenes of wonder woman with terrorists and Battle of themyscira. Coming to other characters, though his portrayal was better than the theatrical version, batman was not so special. Wonder woman has awesome fight scenes and is badass as usual. Aquaman's entry in atlantis fight was good. Superman was great in a small role. Darkseid was made his presence felt.Another highlight is junkie xl's music. I am his big fan since mad max. He gives here another adrenaline pumping soundtrack. I am actually glad he was replaced in josstice league because his music belongs to only snyder. That feel you will get only in snyder.But this film is not perfect. Its very very very very long. It could have been over in 3hrs 30 minutes but the epilogue was dragged a lot. The joker cameo or the nightmare scene was not really necessary. The final fight felt too short for me. And lois lane played by the very talented amy adams was only given to look sad and gloomy throughout.On the whole, ZSJL was a very satisfying experience despite its exhausting length. Its epic, intense, emotional and million times better than josstice league. I don't think it would have been released in this form back in 2017 because it was planned into two parts before the tragedy occurred in Snyder's family. Snyder must ended the first part in a gripping in order to make the film and its sequel successful.Snyder had a vision for DC but wb ruined everything. They released snyder cut not because of the love towards fans but to boost hbo max. So, after the success of #releasethesnydercut# movement, I wish DC fans for the success of #restorethesnyderverse# movement.", "Another great surprise of 2021!": "Compared to the nonsensical garbage we saw in 2017, this movie is spectacular! It truly feels like a continuation of \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman v Superman\" and the plot much clearer now, and doesn't feel forced. The characters are more likable and the jokes are actually funny. After watching this, I really hope now that WB one day has a change of heart, and decide to continue the Snyderverse.I don't understand why people criticize the runtime, the \"Lord of The Rings\" movies were also close to 4 hours, and many people nowadays have a habit of binge watching, and people don't even have to see this at theaters, we can just sit down, relax and watch this at our home, we can pause whenever we want too, so no one should have a problem with the runtime. So I apologize for saying this but, I feel that the people who are criticizing the runtime (or the entire movie) are just bullsh#tting because they are not interested in the movie (then don't watch), or because they are judging it based on the 2017 version. Critics treat this movie like a \"Director's Cut\" with 2 hours of added deleted scenes, but they don't understand that, technically speaking, the 2017 version was a \"Director's Cut\", Whedon's Director's Cut, while this is the ORIGINAL version that we were supposed to see in 2017, so stop treating this movie as 'just' a Director's Cut, and instead look at it as a whole, new movie, then you just might like it, if you didn't before. Again, I apologize for my harsh comments, but I felt that it was necessary to say them.", "A mind blowing must watch movie": "The best 4 hours of movie I have watched so far. Time just flies by. To be honest it was bit slow in between, but that was good to know details of all the characters. Snyder is the future of DC Universe. In 2.5hr movie it is hard to elaborate everything, but 4 hours is simply the best. The ending is little long, but with perfect touch to it. Snyder rules now.", "Very impressed": "OooooWheeeeee that was an amazing movie! 4 hours went by so fast. Really goes to show how badly joss Whedon failed the first time. Sad to think that this won't lead into anything else.", "Met and exceeded expectations": "As someone who thoroughly enjoyed BvS: Dawn of Justice I was always excited to see Snyder's vision of the DCEU. I actually didn't hate the theatrical release but I knew that was a different movie than what Snyder envisioned. After watching Zack Snyder's Justice League I will never watch the theatrical release again. I love that it was four hours. I remember when movies had long run times with intermissions and you got to watch and enjoy true storytelling. This movie met my expectations (which were high) and then exceeded them. It's crazy just how much WB and Whedon butchered this movie. Snyder got to tell his story and what an epic movie this is. All the characters are fleshed out, the villain is more well rounded and much more threatening, the four hours flew by and left me wanting more. The humor was toned done especially with Flash which made the not forced humor even better.It was great seeing characters like Flash, Joker, Cyborg, and Steppenwolf get a chance to really show how great they are.Great seeing the best live action Batman again without the corny jokes. I hope we do get an Affleck solo film with Deathstroke and Leto's Joker.This is what a movie experience is. I hope WB backs off and begs Snyder to continue to bring his vision to the DCEU.10/10", "Just better": "Apart from the music, witch fails big time, this version is better in every way... still some casting and dialogue sucks... the effects of the CGI creatures is also better than the first version but still not as good as Avengers, but I'm glad Warner put up the money to fix the movie.", "Please restore the ZSverse": "A great movie, great action, and finally we got what we deserve. Thanks ZS.", "What a Masterpiece!": "I can't stop thinking about how great this movie is! Zack Snyder didn't disappoint, we got an unforgettable Masterpiece.\nI didn't get enough of this universe I really want more!", "More of the same from Snyder": "Yet another exercise in hollow style over substance. Its pretentious, boring, and needlessly long. The dialogue is, at best, basic and the effects are mediocre. With so much CGI it might as well be a cartoon and watching it is about as much fun as watching someone else play a video game. It will primarily appeal to 13 year olds, or those with the intellect of a 13 year old. Which reinforces the fact that Snyder is the new Michael Bay. Its a shame that the once mighty DC of the Nolan years has been reduced to being a series of music videos starring DCEU characters. Hopefully this is the last we will ever see of the so called \"Snyderverse\".", "We need the snyder-verse": "Thank you very much zack for this masterpiece, one of the best movies I've seen, i hope we will see more movies of snyderverse in the future. God bless you\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc.", "Restore the Snyder Verse!": "Finally the Justice League movie we deserved and Zack Snyder imagined. It never felt like a four hour movie, it had no scenes that should have been cut.\nEvery character shines and gets bis own moments, as well as a convincing background. The story finally makes sense now and even Steppenwolf gets a few surprising character moments. He also looks cooler and a lot more scary.\nThe final battle is so epic, I wished all the time I could have seen this movie in the cinema for the first time.\nIt has lots of typical \"Zack Snyder moments\" like slow motion overkill and the overall dark atmosphere, but that's exactly what fans expected from him!\nThankfully there are only very few jokes, and not the very very bad ones from the 2017 version, that ruined that already disastrous movie even more.\nZack Snyder's justice League always respects itself, its characters and the fans. Snyder really managed to create an epic movie that shows our heroes in all their glory!", "Knocking off 2 Stars for 4:3 Aspect Ratio": "The movie itself was a significant improvement over the original theatrical cut. However, I am subtracting two stars for the decision to air this in 4:3 aspect ratio. It looked awful on my white screen TV. This may play well in a true IMAX setting in the theater but for a home viewer, it was ridiculous. The huge bars on the side of the Screen was a distraction to me from the beginning. Sorry to all the purest out there, but this was a horrendous viewing experience as much as I enjoyed the new cut.", "Worth the Wait!": "This ZS' version would've broken box office records! Why, why, why didn't the studio execs get it? To that end, it is a must see and was definitely worth the wait!!! Bravo Zach Snyder!!!", "Better than theatrical cut, but not by much.": "The theatrical cut was dumb and messy. This is slightly less dumb and messy, but its not over in 1.5 hrs. You have to sit through 4hrs of mess (inc about 5 different endings with joker showing up randomly).Great visuals though.", "Zac Snyder's 4 hours of average": "Oof, where to begin. It'll keep you entertained and busy, but it will never make you care or truly feel engaged. Why? Here's why:The story is flawed, linear and full of plotholes. The biggest being that the bad guys somehow cannot put one and one together and realise that the planet where they found the three boxes now, is exactly the same planet as where they lost it in the first place. Wow, shocker.The characters are bland, boring and have nothing that makes you care for them. Superman coming back from the dead feels kinda cool, but that's about it. The Flash is just some nerdy kid who's a genius, but isn't. Cyborg guy is just some teenager who hates his dad until he doesn't-also a genius, but never really shows it. Wonder Woman equals a perfect daughter in law good girl. Aquaman seems the most intelligent one, but never goes further then mwuah. You never care for what happens to any of them and their stories go all over the place.That last part is also due to editing. The first 30-45 minutes are like walking through a town you barely know holding a map upside down. You feel like you should know where you are, yet you can't really seem to get it. The story jumps all over the place and introduces characters so chaotically that you will simply lose interest. And the chaos is not because of all the different characters, there are many movies out there that introduce a lot of characters (e.g. Marvel, Godfather), yet it doesn't feel chaotic. The story flows naturally and every cut makes sense. Now we just meet a lot of cool looking people with cool powers, yet we have no clue what's going on.Combine this with way, way, waaaay to many slow motion shots (like seriously, it's insane), and you have yourself a story that feels chaotic, yet dragged and slow at the same time. And unlike with some of Snyder's well known work, like 300, the slow motion shots serve 0 purpose. Often they're just there to make characters look cool, like a car commercial showing all the cool gadgets and its sleek design. At least with the commercial it serves the purpose of selling me a car.Then lastly we have the hilarious music at times. Every time Wonderwoman shows up,even if she does literally nothing, prepare to hear a choir or a cool guitar riff. I know it's like a theme song, but it should be subtle. It just feels laughable at times.But not all is bad, the CGI often is quite cool (sometimes laughable, but can't have it all). The character designs are very cool and so is the choreography for the fight scenes. But that's everything this movies really has to offer. The rest of it is tediously chaotic.I guess what I'm trying to say is: did you find this review dragging? Then this movie will definitely not be for you.", "BEST DC MOVIE SINCE THE DARK KNIGHT": "This movie will literally make you want to kneel down to Zack Snyder. It's perfect in every single way and it's damn well better than that trashy Whedon version. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 THIS MOVIE IS PURE MASTERPIECE AT ITS FINEST!!!!!", "Snyder's crappy film streak continues!": "This version of Justice League is basically the 2017 one but more obnoxious, less fun, and boring. Thanks Zack Snyder for providing us six million slow-mo shots and extra filler to hit that 4 hour runtime. Glad you learned your lesson after Batman v Superman. You truly saved the DC franchise and gave Joss Wheden the middle finger he deserved by making this crap.5/10", "It's complicated...": "This movie is okay. I don't particularly dislike it, and I have no desire to ever see it again. Partially because it's four hours long. See, I like a lot about this movie. I like Superman's resurrection, I like the scene where Flash rewinds time, and I think the action and cinematography are pretty good. But, like with The Batman, the script is just not that great. It follows a pretty standard superhero format. If this weren't four hours long, then it would be a slightly above-average superhero movie. But the length is such a massive detractor from my enjoyment of this movie. I've seen it twice, and both times I had to plan it like a week in advance. It is a noticeable improvement over the 2017 cut, but that's not exactly a high bar to cross. I think the reason this has such great reviews is because of the hype surrounding it, and it says a lot that no one talks about this movie after it's worn off. People still talk about The Dark Knight all these years later because it's a film that's as close to perfection that a superhero movie has ever gotten. This was a cool novelty when it came out, but that novelty has since worn off. I wouldn't recommend watching it because it takes an entire sixth of a say to sit through.", "The Justice League We Deserved.": "First of all, I want to Thank Mr Zack Snyder for this beautiful gift. It's a complete different movie from 2017 Justice League. And it is it's plus point. It's a complete package and hell of a journey for 4 hours. It got everything that was missing from 2017. Character's backstory and their role in defeating the enemy. Everyone's contribution was believable. It's not just about Superman. And also a great ending. A must watch. Forget the 2017 version. This is the real Justice League we Deserved.", "Not the DC masterpiece fans wanted but better then the Whedon cut": "This movie is long!!! But for it's four hour run-time the movie has a surprisingly ok pace. But that is also the movie's Achilles Heel. In four hours we get more character backstory that really fleshes out the characters and makes it easier for the viewer to connect with them. But in four hours we also get hit with new plot points and characters that don't seem to add anything to the story. Very briefly in two scenes we are shown that Louis is supposedly pregnant...and then nothing. For me personally, the relationship between Louis and Clark is pretty bland. It has not been properly explored and fleshed out enough for me to really care about a potential hybrid baby.Gal Gadot her reading style, when telling Bruce about the Motherboxes, was just so boring. No offence, but someone with a maybe more seasoned voice could have made that scene way more gripping.Then the character introduced at the end, the Martian Manhunter.....\nI'm not a DC fan but I'm pretty sure there's cooler characters to introduce here, but also did he need to be part of the movie? He literally sat out the whole movie and then in a very hyped up way introduces himself to Bruce....in the end.First of all I could not believe he had the audacity to show his face so late in the game and more importantly there was too less connection here for me to really care about this new character.Then the post credit scene where Superman has gone bad..\nI understand they are setting up potential new storylines and movies but....really I cannot imagine why Superman would go dark. This is a (super boring) alien guy who grew up on earth and even fought his own kind to defend us humans. Even if someone, human or alien, would kill Louis + hybrid baby why would he hold it against all of humanity and enslave/destroy us? I just can't see it happening, but only time and more movies will tell.Those were the most annoying aspects about the movie...oh and the very cringe worthy and random singing of these women...ok I understand they revere Arthur as a God but it was still kinda awkward. Oh and the hiding of the motherboxes.... Really? Humans of back then could not think of anything better then to hide a motherbox, I repeat a motherbox, in a shallow hole in some random forest? I don't know, it was either very smart cause no one would expect to find it in such an easy to think of hiding place or just plain old dumb. I'm thinking the latter.Ok now for the positive aspects. The biggest positive change for me was the character of Steppenwolf. He was way less cartoony then his Whedon doppelganger. I actually took him serious and you could tell he was fighting for a cause and that brought the movie up to a more serious, darker level. So props to Zack Snyder for that. I just was not sure about his shiny outfit...\nAs mentioned before the characters were more fleshed out which made the climax way more fun to watch. In the end it actually felt like they were a group or better said a league.So all in all not a masterpiece but enjoyable and way better the Whedon cut.", "Can't stop thinking about this movie": "The only bad thing about this movie was the ratio.Absolutely goes the extra mile from the original , this is the film that DC needed to rival Marvel Snyder is a genius.", "Finally dc!": "DC! This is what people have been waiting for!!! All the DC movies have been underwhelming at best except for the first wonder woman which could've been better. This director better be the only one touching these movies from now on. The build to the fight, the introduction of new characters, and the opening for a sequel was very well done. I just finished it and can't wait to play it again. 4 hours well spent!", "Its better looking garbage": "The reviews I see of this made me have to do a quick review. I'm a 50/50 guy with DC and Marvel first off. I assume its DC superfans that are giving it all the love but this movie was still bad, really bad. Dumb plot full of randomness, could care less about the characters and the cinematography looked so generic. Some of the characters like Steppenwolf and Cyborg were much easier to look at. Otherwise, so dumb. I was so sick of hearing \"mother box\" I wanted to have a stroke. I mainly watched it because my 14yo son wanted to see it and i thought id give it one more chance. That is all. Have a nice day", "Perfection": "Absolutely amazing, the dialog between joker and batman is worth the watch alone", "digitally enhanced actors???": "I admit it, I don't usually care for these comic book genre movies. For some reason, I reached a certain age and afterwards cartoons and comic books just didn't appeal anymore. It's not my cup of joe but who am I to say the lemmings shouldn't jump. How can I criticize when it's a trillion dollar industry. Anyway, I tried to watch this. I watched about 20 mins then got bored, then watched some more and realized I missed a crucial plot thread and then tried to back up and figure out what I missed and then I just got confused and bored and could care less about the 'mother' whatever. I can't fault the production though because it's as good as ever I've see for screen, or video console, but I guess I just don't read enough comics or watched enough soap operas to follow the plot.But, what strikes me about these films more than anything is the way that they digitally enhance the actors. Not the first time, I've seen some hollywood star eliminate the wrinkles, trim the jaw, and lose the haunches and paunches thru computers. But variety is good for life and there's a time for everything so I have to ask, do I want my great great great great grandchildren watching justice league XXIV with a digitally enhanced version of ben affleck?", "SO MUCH BETTER THAN 2017 VERSION!!": "This movie was hands down 1,000% better than Whedon's 2017 flic. I am a huge Superman fan and love the DCEU. Its heroes are just cooler than Marvel in my opinion, and that was on display here in Zack Snyder's Justice League. I only wish I could have seen it in all its cinematic glory on the big screen! I will happily stream it on repeat from HBO until I can buy the 4K Blu-ray edition. A great move that finally did The Justice League the honor it deserved.", "Far more superior and the best superhero movie so far\ud83d\udd25": "This movie is far more superior then the one released on theatre..but thanks to the fans who supported the the movement of #snydercut they showed what an army of fans can do and zack snyder showed what he can do if he have creative control...thanks to zack snyder and the dc fans(army) you all are an real soldiers... salute to you all who supported this movement....and lets hope w.bros understand that dc needs zack snyder so lets hope he come back and show his vision to live action platform #restorethesnyderverse \ud83d\udd25", "Sublime.": "Author's cinema, a beautifully constructed film, with a love for the genre, and especially for comics, and that is where the director captures his essence in a devotional letter, for something that is more than a simple corporate project. Seeing this movie felt like witnessing an epic at the opera, the resurgence of the gods, fortunately it has nothing to do with the Frankenstein of 2017. A detail nothing less than all those I could mention, the soundtrack, which frames several moments in an accurate and exquisite way. Personally, I'm not a fan of DC comics, but a fan of good cinema and this Snyder Cut, it is.", "Slightly better, very similar": "The movie carried the same elements as the 2017-version of the movie. However, the Snyder cut has a more coherent backstory and invested significantly more time to develop characters. It was slightly darker (contrast + brightness) and gloomier, but generally felt like the same movie.Overall, the massive amount of added contet helped the movie to feel more well-paced in edits and transitions, which was the greatest improvement the Snyder-cut contributed with. That said, this is very much your generic superhero movie, which its own strength and weaknesses. Nothing shocking, nothing outstanding nor surprising - just your average hero movie. What the movie failed to do, despite of the 4-hour time span, was to make me feel invested in the characters struggles, fights and losses. A lot of time was given for this purpose, however, it was not prioritized to engage the viewers feelings to any significant degree. Usually, this is can be done by an engaging origin story, which this movie understandably didn't have time to do (or redo) for all the characters.The movie is ok, it felt a little shorter than the 4+ hours, but it just can't compete with Marvels avengers-series, Iron Man or Dr Strange.", "I say this as a huge DC fan: this is still not very good": "It's better than the theatrical cut, it's better than Man of Steel and it's undoubtedly better than Batman v Superman. For better or for worse, this is Snyder's uncompromised vision-and all the muted colours and self-indulgent grandiosity that come along with it.The film benefits greatly from the insane length by providing some much needed context for many of the disjointed plot points found in the original cut. Victor in particular gets a lot more screen time and feels like a far more fleshed out character. I can see why Ray Fisher was so upset since virtually his entire arc was plucked out of original cut. But the length is a double-edged sword: the film is actually coherent and contains stronger characterization but many scenes drag on for way too long and it often felt like a slog to get through. Snyder always had an obsession with slow motion but here it is exacerbated to a hilarious degree. I swear if you took out most of the excessive slow-mo (essentially any scenes that didn't involve Barry) and the tacked-on ending you could easily shave over half an hour off the final product. But this is what Snyder wanted and this is what his fans wanted. I hope you're satisfied.This isn't the holy grail of superhero movies. Much of it feels like it wants to stand tall as some kind of massive, important monolith of the genre. Meanwhile it still suffers from many of the same issues that plague Snyder's other projects. Junkie XL's new score is appropriately bombastic but even that can get overbearing. Did we really have to hear a woman wailing every time Diana does something badass? It verges on self-parody. And even with the hindsight of DC movies that have been released in the meantime, they didn't address the continuity errors with Aquaman. For that matter, why does Amber Heard have a British accent now? She never did before. At least it doesn't contain maddening levels of character assassination like Snyder's previous movies in this series, so that's a point in its favour. It feels like he took some of the past criticism to heart and I'm glad he got to see this through to the end after experiencing such a terrible family tragedy.Do I like it? Not really, but I'm happy that a major studio allowed a filmmaker's vision to come to fruition in the end. But if you really want to see a few hours of the Justice League I would say you're better off watching a season of the animated series.", "Refreshing": "This movie is the proof that Zack Snyder actually had a plan and cared about the DCEU.

Movies are not made by committees or focus groups. That's too many cooks spoiling the broth.

All the Marvel fanboys putting this movie down didnt help. Yes Marvel make great movies, but this DC Justice League movie is very very watchable, just give it a chance.Originally I thought directors cut, will have a few extra scenes. However watching this, its like a completely different movie. There are so many extra scenes with fantastic CGI I lost count, I couldnt believe this much extra footage has been taken or generated, you can see why these movies cost so much if they work on so many scenes that dont maike it into the final cut.There were a few scenes from the first movie I would have kept in personally, but on the whole, this cut improves the movie by at least 2 stars for me. Definately worth a watch, even though its long at 4hrs. I actually had to watch this in two sessions, which is fine definately worth it.Back in the 80s there used to be a half way intermission at the movie theatre for snacks and icecreams, they should start making better longer movies, so they all make sense and dont cut out important story binding scenes and bring back the intermissions to break it up. More money for movie theatre too and lets face it movie tickets and snacks are not cheap any longer, so help out the theatres and also get your monies worth I say.", "Why is the Martian so underutilized?": "This ones good. Really good.Theres so little negatives so lets be done with that first. Primarily its long, really long. (worth the time) but still long. Secondly the Martian and Lantern are way underutilized.At least the lantern had his own movie but why is the Martian used so scarcely? Shapeshifting, strength, flight, intangibility, telepathy....theres so much to use and hes got like a guest appearance.That apart theres not much else to complain about. Good character development, good plot development, good setting, climax everything.Just go in with time in hand and you wont be disappointed,Hope Martian and Lantern are used better next time.

So in this sense my respect to Snyder and to the post-production team this was fantastic achievement and a lesson on how crucial the editor's work can be, 90% of the images pre-recorded were re-used and shifted a story completely regardless of the fact that the main plot is the same.With that, let me mention that I am just the casual DC and Marvel movie and TV show fan and not the comics affectionate, so I cannot speak into how faithful this is to the original comics, but only from a movie perspective. Marvel has made many movies at this point, some were awful, some were OK but lately it seems they found their right track, they are more light and less dark movies compared to DC, filled with comedic elements and with the latest introduction of multiple characters, a good depiction of their relationship with each other.They seem to have found the right track for their formula and even though these are of course purely fantasy movies, obviously, I always get a sense that the plot and whatever ridiculous abilities from the super heroes we see, seems to always make some sort of sense or at least a plausible explanation is provided. I mean there are of course some ridiculous characters, like Thor when first introduced and his respective two movies, but even he found the ideal tone on the third.So now into what DC has been doing, I disliked almost all of the standalone movies, of course I am not counting with Nolan's Batman which is the single best trilogy ever made, or even Man of Steel also from Snyder which I actually enjoyed but rather the more recent ones like Wonder Woman or Aquaman. Both these movies felt ridiculous, I mean on an origin story or an introduction story we usually make sense of how the hero came to be, but for both characters they are simply presented to us as members and demi-Gods of old mythology... I mean on a universe where Batman also exists..? Again from a comic standpoint that might make sense, but form someone who saw the Nolan trilogy and how it felt so real, I had a very hard time on accepting these were the heroes that would be cooperating with the bat crusader.So logically, when the first Justice League came, it felt simply ridiculous, not only these were terrible characters and most of them I haven't even heard of, the plot made absolutely no sense - it was a generic fantasy action mess, I actually gave it a 3 out of 10.So yes, this is a major improvement no doubt about it, however given the characters present in them I can't disconnect from the feeling I expressed above, it is a good movie, but the characters and their own stories are so bad to me that I can't rate this movie higher, no matter how much of a fantastic job it was put into it I simply don't care about any of the characters to this point - nonetheless I do hope they pick more of Snyder work, maybe he turns things around, the ending was without a doubt interesting.", "4 hours without boredom. Exciting and fun": "It was a nice film in which you see the forces of Justice League come to the fore. You just see that Justice league is different from The Avengers, much much stronger en smarter. To make a long story short. Definitely worth a look. The only thing I don't understand is and can someone please explain to me: WHY DO I HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE SQUARE? A big minus in my eyes, so therefore absolutely no higher than an 8.", "Justice for the League, Snyder, Cyborg, Flash, The Fans and hopefully Ben Affleck too.": "Not a hater of the original, it was kinda fun but felt like a troubled production and didnt make a whole let of sense.In this version Snyder does what he does best, bringing a stunning visual style thats lets you see the action and give everything an Epic feel.People moan about his use of slo mo but i love it, if you read a comic you can look at a panel or a page for ages to take it all in, his style suits this perfectly.He shows respect for the source material and the audience.The much Rockier soundtrack fits perfectly and makes the longer, better crafted action scenes tons better.Cyborg is more interesting, Flash less of a Clown.And finally Ben Afflecks Batman gets a chance to shine in the action, his sequence in the finale is just great.He got too much hate for his Batman, he had a tuff gig coming in with BvS, and was one of the better things in the previous JL, turning in a weary, older Batman and a Bruce wayne that wasnt just smarmy.ZS Justice League is not a perfect film but its damn close, its worth a 10 to recognise the fact that the fans and the filmmakers cared it enough to make it happen.", "Loved it, almost great": "This is much better. Plot, music, shots, logic are make this movie not just watchable but entertaining! But with better dialogues and little details it would absolutely rock. Dialogues sometimes little cringe or just useless or too obvious, or information given in a boring way. Details and logic in during some action could be easily pumped to perfection. They need writer that will watch all scenes meticulously and change it in a way that will make scenes work better and it won't be clumsy. Now I don't think comparison to Whedon version needed, it's obvious that this one is superior in every way.", "100 pure awesomeness": "Totally worth binge watching all 4 hours . Zach Snyder totally made this movie into a masterpiece.

It definitely helps if you have seen the original 2017 version, as it improves upon it in nearly every way.One of the main issues I had with the original was that a lot of the characters backstories felt underdeveloped and rushed. Unlike The Avengers, 3 of these characters (Cyborg, Aquaman, The Flash) do not have solo films that take place before the events of this one. Since this version is 4 hours long, you got plenty of time to flesh out these characters.Anyways, there's a lot more I could talk about that I liked, but overall I would definitely recommend watching this. It is 4 hours long, but it's broken up into parts so you go take a break while you watch it. I didn't though, I watched the whole thing in one sitting! 8/10 great film.", "Was worth waiting 4years": "Enjoyed every minute of it\nLoved the character development\nAnd would love to see JL2 and JL 3", "It's the same movie, don't need to bother": "Zack Snyder took deleted scenes and just edited with the 2017's Justice League.

The character development and attention to detail shines and it feels so nice to say we have a great Live-Action \"Justice League\" film. I've never been the biggest fan of Zack Snyder, but I acknowledge that all film makers should see their work/art interpreted the way that they intended, and this is arguably one of if not his best. Every one is on their A-Game. What this means for the future I don't know, but what this has given us now is Hope.", "This is worse somehow": "The original Justice League movie was terrible, yet somehow Zack Snyder figured out a way to make it so much worse. The new 4 hour runtime does an excellent job of filling an already boring story with so much useless filler, unnecessary slow-motion, pointless fan-service, as well as removing what little of the original movie that was actually tolerable. The fact that not only are some people praising this movie, but Zack Snyder's entire history of running DC into the ground shows that Snyder fans are the new Trump supporters: too stupid to realise how stupid their leader is.Don't bother with this movie, you'll hate yourself for it.", "4hrs long and still average": "I really dont get the scores for this, maybe its a DC fanboy thing? DC has some of the most recognizable superheroes of all time and yet continue to miss the mark when it comes to making compelling films. All in all, the casting of the main characters is horrible. Aside from Aquaman and Superman, the rest are either pedestrian choices or bad (Irons as Alfred? cmon). The story line is not only over the top serious but because everyone is miscast, the lack of chemistry makes it even worse. Endgame did such a good job of making a solid, serious movie that this just seems like trash in comparison. I long for the day the DC Universe gets the same end to end quality treatment as Marvel has done to its canon.", "WOW AMAZINGLY GREAT": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (SPOILER FREE REVIEW)First of all I'm happy that we finally got to see\nZack's true vision for this movie.I'm one of the many that got to see this film early than everyone else.\nI admit that I'm not a big fan of Snyder films\nBVS(Ultimate Edition) & MOS but I liked the 300.\nWhen I saw the trailers it was good but I had no expectations so,\nI wouldn't set up myself for a disappointment but after watching this film\nI was satisfied, It was great but the final 20 minutes felt out of place I didn't like it\nI thought the film was over because that scene is the perfect way to end the film.\nThe editing made no sense sometimes.\nThey cropped some scenes and stretched it to fit the 4:3 aspect ratio.\nThe pacing is good but could be better.

This was to the 2017 release what reading the book is to most screen adaptations. I was a fan of comic book superheroes until my teen years.

A supreme improvement to the Whedon cut.": "However, it is still 4 hours long and I'm not sure I'd have taken that time in a theatre. I know Endgame was long too but it was a highly anticipated conclusion to years of world building. Understandably DCEU was in too much of a hurry to set up characters with separate movies. Hence the runtime. The 4:3 Aspect ratio didn't bother me on my small laptop screen. It could have done with a little bit more color though, not asking MCU colorful but it doesn't have to be a dull grey either.The positives are Flash and Cyborg's fleshed out back stories. Ezra Miller holds great potential as the Flash and this movie made me want a Flashpoint Paradox movie. Cyborg/Stone had his fair share of scenes this time around and he didn't just spring out of nowhere so that was appreciated.Superman and Batman plots were pretty much the same albeit more nuanced. That is of course until the final dream sequence. It just looked a bit stretched and also, sadly one that will never bear any fruition into future movies. Jared Leto is still meh. Deathstroke vs Batman would have been a sight. Evil Superman vs Batfleck, would it not have been repetitive? Idk. Injustice on the big screens would have been great.The Earth Alliance vs Darkseid battle scene was epic not withstanding the CGI. Zeus and Ares blasting thunders was awesome. Not convinced by Darkseid though, in fact the character design of all the villains is absolutely terrible. A different Steppenwolf but still a terrible one in my opinion. (Take a hint from the Justice League animated series please, will be a vast improvement). Though I wasn't expecting any improvement in the CGI, it is after all a re-edit not a new movie. I hope DCEU if still existent can improve upon that.The final battle sequence was OK, it was nice to see Flash time traveling (again Flashpoint Paradox please!!). But it still left a lot to be desired. Also the power levels of characters is confusing. Though does that really matter now?Overall the movie was a vast improvement to the Whedon cut. But again it was far from what the DCEU could potentially be. Generally speaking, I feel there are some spectacular stories to tell from the DC comics and it's a shame we are left to rue with \"What Might Have Been\".", "Justice we deserve": "This movie is exactly something DC Fans have been longing for a long time.\nZack captures the essence of each of the 6 characters in an artistic fashion which only Snyder is capable of executing.\nCoherent storyline, terrific character build up, bombastic action, and electrifying soundtrack, Zack Snyder's Justice league is indeed a visual masterpiece, and does justice to DC Fans and beyond.\nI hope the studio let's him finish his vision.", "I didn't find why people was so hyped": "Cgi was bad, story was OK and they add some new characters, background stories and fights that's it.", "Ok for fanatics, confusing for casuals.": "It's understandable why fanatics automatically gave this 10 before even watching it. But, unlike Marvel this is quite confusing for casuals, as many characters and backstory you are automatically expected to know, and they don't even try to explain.As a DC fan - there are unfortunate character choices which differ from the characters in the comics.As usual Synder has more visual than substance.He is excellent at creating a visually rich world, with some good CGI, however there were many things in this movie like BVS and MOS that were over designed, resulting in poor CGI, which take you out of the movie.Some dialogue is good, but some was almost TV level basic and again takes you out of the movie.Overall 5/10Entertaining but no Infinity War / Endgame.1/10 - shouldn't of brought back Heard for new scenes!", "Justice is served!": "What a phenomenal movie!

I loved Man of Steel, i loved BvS and i loved Zack Snyder's Justice League. This movie is his hard work. And the one we've looked forward to see. And it certainly reached my expectations. Or maybe more.This movie is far far better than 2017 Justice League. Amazing visuals, incredible writing, better action, a great Steppenwolf and then Darkseid. Zack has intertwined everything excpetionally. All i need is a sequel to Snyder cut. And i hope Warner Bros. deliver it soon. After witnessing that epic ending, i'm quite sure there's going to be a Justice League 2.I mean it was fantastic. The first half was a little uninteresting, considering how many times i've seen it. But the second half is incredible. I mean, this movie is nothing like 2017. This is a completely different one. This is the one we deserved. 2017's working efforts must have been a little down, but this is great, alright.Watch it. 4 hours maybe a little exhausting but i telling you it's worth a watch, especially the second half.Visuals : 89/100Direction : 91/100Story : 85/100Pacing : 84/100OG score : 94/100Overall music score : 83/100Cinematography : 92/100Overall : 90/100Recommendation : 92%", "Now this is something we really deserve": "It fulfilled everything I expected from the start to the end..It shows The real power of the Superman & The Flash..I loved it", "Some of the worst CGI and cliche storyline": "The CGI is terrible, the writing is laughable, the storyline brings nothing new to the table. And it just looks plain bad.Acting was decent and it had some nice music... Thats about it...", "An insight into how big movie studios work": "My reflection is that it provides an interesting glimpse into the world of movies and movie studios. I remember that BVS didn't receive much love when it was released but I watched the longer ultimate edition on blu ray and found it to be a much better story, and the same is true with Justice League, although obviously this is a complete undoing and redoing of what we got in 2017.I know that 4 hours is a long time (I watched it in 2 sittings) but necessary for Zack to build the momentum, the character and plot development. I think the main success of this film is that it allows the director to fully realise their vision, a vision that was obviously at odds with the studio when it was first released. I wonder if Zack hadn't had to bow out if we would have still got the same film, or if he was given more space and freedom this time?The two versions of Justice League are chalk and cheese alongside each other, it's all the little extra beats that breathe much needed life into Zack's completed vision...like the locals singing Aquaman into the water... it must have been such a disappointment to those that knew what Zack had put together to see what we finally got in 2017.This restored vision would have well and truly set the stage for some sequels... and maybe it still could? I can imagine what happened though, looking at the success of Marvel, to make the money and appeal to as wide an audience as possible it was turned into a fast paced live comic book, with plenty of red sky's and a light heartened tone. No depth, no substance. I really enjoyed seeing cyborg's backstory and emotional story arc central to the plot. Even the 4:3 ratio didn't phase me too much after about half an hour.It's a really good film now, and a testament to what can be achieved when studios get out of the way of directors with a vision. Let the storyfolk tell their story without interfering or wondering what the other \"Marvel kids\" are doing. Great job Mr Snyder!", "Master class on how to cram 3 hrs into 4 hr movie": "There's absolutely no need for this much slo-mo.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. The scenes and action are beautifully done and you could print out scenes in an art gallery. It's just that I was expecting more.But still I was entertained and wowed by the CGI. Well done!", "Let there be justice!": "\"And what's your ability?\" \"I'm rich.\"4 hours, oh my. These 4 hours passed much quicker than I expected though! That was a really nice movie, I love these Avengers style movies where a bunch of extraordinary characters unite.Because of Superman's death, the otherworldly creatures know that Earth's strongest protector is gone. That calls them to Earth to collect the so-called Mother boxes which have the ability to deform particles. If all three come together, then the monsters from Darkseid can combine them to destroy all of Earth. Ok, they don't really have any greater motivation - so the enemy definitely doesn't measure up to Thanos.To counteract, Batman decides to bundle together a team of special individuals. All with special abilities - well, and himself, the one who is rich. The movie tries to do a bit much here but that's why it's 4 hours long. It manages to introduce every one of these characters.At some point, the characters realize that a mother box could bring back Superman. Since they themselves are not strong enough to defeat their foe, they decide to try it with the accompanied risks. Risks they did bring but Superman was eventually successfully revived.Not sure what I think about the power levels. Should Superman really be this much stronger than the rest of the team combined? What makes him this strong? I mean Wonder Woman is literally a Goddess.The main part of the movie ends with Barry going over light speed to time travel and reverse the destruction of the entire world. Unfortunately, we didn't really get to see a super high stake battle. When Superman joined, the enemy didn't stand a chance.The real ending is an epilogue that foreshadows a lot of things to come. They are quite intriguing and makes us thirsty for more. However, it seems that Zack Snyder is not planning another Justice League too soon. That is quite disappointing. Baiting us like this and then not delivering. :(The movie was quite suspenseful and nicely shot. It was rarely boring and even though it had many predictable scenes, they were still a nice sight. I'm not that much a fan that the filming is so dark - apparently much of Snyder's style. Batman had some nice humorous scenes, he was the last character I expected to give us the comedic relief but it fit quite well with his character!Now Superman is back, and the question of Suicide Squad should be asked again: Who would stop Superman if he turns evil? Apparently, the answer is: No one can. At least that was the result of the battle in the middle of the movie. Will this problematic come up again in the future?", "Long overdue": "Zack Snyder has without a shadow of a doubt given us a masterpiece.\nThe movie will get 100s of rewatched from fans of DC and comics all over the world.

FOR REAL!": "While every movie has its flaws, as this one does, I don't find that they're even worth mentioning, because they did nothing to detract from my overall steadily held excitement and thorough enjoyment during the entire four hours of this wondrous, and truest so far of any DC live action experience, adaptation of the comics.Each character was well-represented, and I found there to be enough \"story\" there for each one to get me hooked. Each one was set up beautifully for solo movies, not that it needed to be done, but at the least they were characters that were taken and treated seriously as leading characters and not just side-kicks to Superman. What could have been an ugly, boiled mash of too much stuff and too many people going on to make cohesive sense, was actually beautifully woven into easily digestible segments to the audience. I'm excited to see more from each of these characters in the future.(Not really spoilers at this point on, but still they are if you've not seen either version of the movie. In which case, DO NOT see the first one, or don't watch it until AFTER you see this well-crafted 4-hour epic, so you can laugh! Lol. Just a bit of advice.)Superman's re-appearance was familiar if you've seen the 2017 version, but was also different in that Superman's encounter with Batman was much more intelligent. Remember how he took Batman into the air and reciprocally asked him if he bleeds? Yeah, that didn't happen in this one, thank goodness, or thank Snyder, I mean. Nope, it was a whole lot more accurate in terms of how Superman would have eliminated Batman, by simply using his heat vision. Boom. Dead! No fuss, no muss. But fortunately for Bruce Wayne, Lois Lane intervened just in time, though it didn't save him from a new pair of undies nevertheless. Speaking of which, how smelly would that get in a the bat suit?Cut!Next, I really gained a much better understanding of the Cyborg character. The actor was awesome and really filled the shoes. I heard previously (I forget where) that he no longer wants to play that role because of bad things between he and Whedon, but I do hope he reconsiders if he hasn't already, to stay on with Snyder and company!New characters! Martian Manhunter! OMG! Another \"nod\" to Supergirl's open hibernation capsule! Darkseid, in the flesh!And a lot of really gritty but awesome dialogue amongst the bad guys, to boot, not to mention much more interaction between our heroes as well.Some people are going to try and pick apart this movie, but when I consider a project of such a gigantic scale, now that I've seen the end result myself, I am, as nothing more than an average male consumer of all things DC comics, quite, *quite* content with Zack Snyder's vision and results.

It's undoubtedly much superior than the theatrical release i saw on 2017 which left me scratching my head and how Superman looks so weird with the CGI. Thankfully ZSJL erased all of that and i'm happy to experience an epic masterpiece from a superb director. What a treat!", "Can't wait to see the sequel": "Regardless of it's faults, this is the greatest comic book film ever. Warner have got to give us a sequel.", "Nice work from zack right here!": "I won't make smo analysis of this films quality but i just want to say that this film is really entertain me much better than joss whedon version. For example the battle of jleague and stepphen wolf in joss whedon version make superman like a god and the others like trash who can't win the battle. But in this version we see more teamwork and more epic scene also this version is not really dark. But i read another people review said this version also bad i mean maybe they're marvel fans who hate dc so much but to be honest this version is way much better than before", "A Masterpiece. A TITAN of a Film": "It is hard to even know what to say about this film I thought this was going to be an amazing experience, but it delivered more than I can even describe. This is a spectacle you will never forget. I PRAY we get more of the SnyderVerse.Thank You Zack Snyder!", "Enjoyed it.": "Not blown away or anything. Definitely enjoyed it though. The theatrical cut looks like garbage compared to this.. that has less to say about the Snyder cut and more to say about how garbage the theatrical cut was LOL.Overall a worthy sequel. I will watch it again for sure.", "Why so serious?": "Zack Snyder's Justice League follows the formation of the Justice League and Steppenwolf's evil plot to destroy the world. It's a clear improvement from the Justice League released 4 years ago, but whether it serves to \"Restore the SnyderVerse\" remains to be seen.", "Everything makes sense": "I just watched man of steel, Batman vs superman and zack snyders justice league and it all makes sense. DC FOREVER!!!!!!", "Glorious": "We need more from zack\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse.Zack is a legend\nWarner should apologise to us.", "It's pretty much the same JL we got, only with more slow motion, and unnecessary scenes. There's a good movie in there waiting to be released, but this one is not it.": "Mild spoilers here.8.4 does not truly describe this movie.Is it better than JL 2017? Yep.Action scenes are better. There are some truly breathtaking scenes. Snyder is a master when it comes to fights. There were certain parts where I was glad I was watching the movie. His JL looks far better than the 2017 one, which seems austere and pale in comparison.Now, for the bad things.Snyder tried again to cram 20+ movies into one. He seems to desperately want to measure up to Marvel. First of all - he can't. He's not a good director. He can chroeograph incredible fighting scenes. He can create some out of this world visuals. But he cannot direct a movie with the right pacing and amount of detail. He should let that to the pros. He's obviously way out of his depth here.If we take out the slow motion scenes, so many of them deeply and completely unecessary, the movie would last 30 minutes less. If we took out all of the unnecessary moments, scenes, and dialogue (like the flying car scene, which leads to nowhere, or the \"Martian Manhunter\" easter egg that has no place in the movie) we could probably take 30 minutes more out of the movie. 3 hours would make for a snappier experience.Still - the major issues are there. There's just not enough time to care about anybody or everybody. WW had her movie, Bats and Superman did, so, yeah. But we don't know a thing about Aquaman, Flash or Cyborg. And there's just not enough time to tell their stories.I wanted for all the exposition to end to watch the fight scenes, just because of how amazing they looked. But it was like a demo of a good movie, not the good movie in itself.Corny melodies accompanying the protagonists, strange changes in sound design (Voices sometimes felt and sounded different from the rest of the movie(, and the fact that the pacing was uneven and SLOW made this movie boring.I'll never watch it again. 4 hours is far too much to waste on a still unfinished product. Still, nice try, Snyder. It's better than the other version. I'll give you that.", "Don't watch this film if you have ADD": "I have attention deficit disorder; why did I think watching this was a good idea?

BUT, it took 4 hours, millions of dollars, and a sequel will never happen. The end is the best part, but it's like watching a preview for Grand Theft Auto 6 and then Rockstar disbanding before it's released. Hopefully we get a Flashpoint Paradox movie at least.Pros:\n1. Steppenwolf is cool looking.\n2. Cyborg isn't a whiny woman.Cons:\n1. 4:3 really? Whatever.\n2. The musical slow parts were laughable.\n3. It's still the same plot.\n4. At 4 hours, good luck not fast forwarding.\n4.5. I laughed at so many parts that weren't supposed to be funny. Especially Cyborg's new scenes.\n5. Meh.", "I cried because of greatness of this movie": "After 4 hours of watching this movie now I got addicted to this type of movies (I need more)Maaan the slow moshing in this movie is crazy it make me hold my breath and give to all my body a goose bumpsBelieve my it look like you get Drugged", "Worth of every Accolades_DC WORLD": "Incredibly different take on JUSTICE LEAGUE.....\nI guess now DC has outgrown itself from other comic World...love the way Snyder gave cyborg long overdue screen time and he has shined like a diamond.Flash is quirky and funny and holds the scenes in the end of the movie...it's not long but worthy to be taken notice and time spent on.Snyder has raised the bar, wish it had released on big screen and please take note that it's far better then Marvel's AVENGER ENDGAME...\nCertainly it's par with the above mentioned marvel installment.", "Epic Storytelling, Needed a Bit More Refinement": "I enjoyed Josstice League, but it was deeply flawed and the choice of photography was...odd. Snyder's version is much more fleshed out, but it removed some of my favorite lines/scenes from the theatrical version, which I felt could have been left in.When the JL are at the Batcave and Aquaman sat on the Lasso of Truth, that was a pretty funny scene and worked because Aquaman is so angry and distant. I thought it added a nice touch. Then, when Superman is revived and the JL are confronting him, Aquaman's heart is racing. Cyborg tells him to calm down and Aquaman replies, \"I can't. He's not right.\" Those were both funny scenes delivered perfectly by Mamoa. Not sure why they were cut other than they were filmed by WhedonThe film is lovely to look at. The longer run time gives Snyder a chance to flesh out some of the characters. I like that Cyborg got a backstory, but I still think there was a ton more to him that got left out. The film had way to much exposition (characters telling us what we already see on screen) and had more scenes of characters just walking than the Lord of the Rings trilogy (Why was Bruce riding a horse across the moutains of Iceland?).Honestly, I feel like the Snyder version is highly rated simply because of its comparison to Whedon's version, not because its a great movie on its own. Way too much talking and walking. Still it was well worth the 4- hour investment as I love these characters. I would really like to see a JL2 to see if Snyder can improve the arc of these heroes.", "Feels like an \"art\" project by an untalented but well funded 3rd grader": "Just awful. I couldn't finish watching it because it already wasted an hour of my day.", "It may have took me all weekend to watch it, but it was worth it.": "Now I haven't been much of DC cinematic fan. But this film has given the DC cinematic universe some promise.Yes it is long! But the way it is broken up into parts as well as it being on hbo max, you can't help but watch it in segments. Which is what I suggest you do. That kept the engagement of what was going to happen next( yet not much suspense) . Now if I were to watch this in 1 sitting I would say the first two hours are boring .But, the last hour and 30 is the most intense and engaging part of the film, filled with some pretty dope action scenes as the heroes showcase their abilities.Please DC keep a similar formula of including more hero's. Because these hero's don't have much personality unfortunately, aside from the Flash lol we need to see more.Aside from some logical things ( such as the lack of the Green Lantern) and the fact that this movie is 4 days long it has a decent story that develops fairly.", "Thank you WB for writing a wrong": "I loved this new cut. Almost everything that was wrong with the first one was corrected in this release. Everyone told me not to watch the original, which I did so that I could stay in line with the other movies. If you haven't seen the original, don't, just watch this one and you'll be satisfied.My only gripes was it was only in 4:3 ratio, which while still in UHD, it defeats the purpose of buying a big screen tv for these types of moves. 4 hours was also a little long. While I had having movies split between different movies this is a long time to go without moving. Finally the last \"Dream scene\" was just out of place. I'm thankful for the correct looking Joker but it just added extra time to the long move and felt very out of place.", "Superman is not the strongest!": "I like the movie but I hate to show superman more powerful than all hero's. I really hate this.", "Resurrection": "A problem is if you have seen the WB version, it takes a bit away from Zack Snyder's version as you know the basis of the story. However Zack Synder's version is superior and offers a lot more. Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) is 4 hours long, but it is broken up into six parts. The storyline is good and something is always happening, so the 4 hours is not too tough to sit through. I watched 2 parts had a break and watched more parts soon after. I actually understood the story better this time, and enjoyed getting to know the characters more. The movie is dark with its lighting, but overall it is visually impressive. As a team these superheroes don't have a lot of chemistry with each other, and they don't all gel well together. This movie along with The Dark Knight are DC's best efforts so far when it comes to a superhero movies.", "An Attempt Was Made": "This film, for all that it lasted, should have been a boring classical music concert, and, even though it doesn't fully reaches Pink Floyd/Yes levels of live concerto, its rock & roll enough to warrant a second viewing.", "Zack Snyder does it again": "After Men of Steel and Batman V Superman now we can truly have a DCEU universe there's nothing to hate on this movie snyder shows one's again that he can tell a story from th comic books at pick perfection and the camera work is fenomenal there's nothing to hate on this one it's what it has to be, besides the CGI that could've been improved it's nothing to complain if Warner gave him more money it could've been ever more better, his vision was perfect the actors did a fantastic job as well. Hope Warner let him finish the story cuz the next one will be even more crazier. Thanks Zack you did it for us, for the fans.", "Terrible & way too long!!!": "My headline says it all. Don't waste your time.... Literally!!!. It's 4 hours long. If you didn't like the first one, you're not going to like this one. All these positive reviews are basically all these grown manchildren defending it, knowing very well that's it's terrible & a complete waste of time. Don't listen to any of the positive reviews!!!!", "This is NOT the same movie & It is EPIC! #RestoreTheSnyderVerse": "Absolutely a FANTASTIC experience! Everything from the movie score to amazing visuals make this movie stand out. The 2017 theatrical version -the infamous Josstice League- was heavily reshot and literally \"BUTCHERED\", in combination with the behind the scenes drama. This experience is fresh & UNIQUE within the Superhero Genre. It IS dark, but with a serious tone and light touches of humour where they need to be, in order to be natural and NOT FORCED(unlike the 2017 version Flash was just a JOKING machine, but in this movie he really shines!). So the only thing I personally forsee that could REALLY step-up DC's game is the SnyderVerse! This is like the Lord Of The Rings saga. Only one word can define this movie: EPICNESS. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse !", "Best Dc Film": "Incredible movie. Impactful action , great story , visuals are stunning . Characters have great story .", "Stop acting like this is the best movie ever": "This movie sucks but because of the first justice league movie everyone is acting like it's god. The ending with joker had no reason to be in it and it was obvious that it was in there for the trailer. And why is the Martian Manhunter in this? Shouldn't it be the green lantern because we see a green lantern in a fighting scene. It's not good.", "The movie all DC fan deserve": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best movie of mine. Well I am a big fan of sci-fic movies. But this movie in in next level. Everything\nis so perfect the story the graphics . Mostly the elaborated story is amazing. I watched the previous justice league and it was okayss. But it is\nnothing to compare Zack Snyder's Justice League .The first film was incomplete , There was no elaborated story given. Zack Snyder's one tells the full story and perfectly.This is the movie all the DC FANS deserve and wants. And if you are a SCI-fic movie lover or a DC lover I recommend 1000% to watch this version of\nJustice League , You will love it.

I liked ever actor in the OG justice league but the movie was an absolute joke. Nothing was explained I could care less about the characters themselves never watched it again. This new cut was extraordinarily better. At first I thought it was just gonna be a much longer joke, not really understanding the different directors but wow what a difference. I actually like the new characters now and I'm excited to see the next movie, that was awesome.

I am amazed at the high reviews it has on here overall the movie is ok but like the last two Avenger movies the run time is to long.

It was a crime not to send the ultimate edition of BVS to cinemas. DC is very well alive thanks to Zack Snyder. Lets hope it does not stop here.", "Wanting something to be better doesn't make it better.": "This movie isn't any better. If they took out all the slow motion it would probably be 45 minutes long. All this praise is ridiculous and has got to be fake. This movie is badly written with weak performances, but not because of the actors, because of the lack of direction.I think our director/directors here were a little too caught up with trying to develop their storyboards than working with the actors, finding the beats within the scenes and finding the motivations of the characters... but I get it, it's hard to do when you're trying to catch up with Marvel.Look, I love comic book heroes. I love DC. But c'mon people, this movie makes everything I love about these characters seem lame as hell. This is trash. A cash grab. A picture book. This is a film. I want to be emotionally invested, I want proper origin stories... I want something better. DC comics is a lot deeper and cooler than this movie.", "Worthy of the hype but in a good not great way": "I thoroughly enjoyed Zack Snyder's justice league infinitely better than the theatrical version but like any movie there are still flaws mainly pacing and an underwhelming score.Nevertheless, the performances especially from the Justice League themselves deserve praise.It was great seeing Snyder's unfiltered visuals and style but I do think it would have benefited to have it streamlined.However, since it is likely that this is Snyder's last entry in the DCEU, it does make sense to put literally everything on full display. And when I say everything I mean everything.", "MUST HAVE SEQUEL": "A little over three years ago, DC fans were disappointed by the big screen release of Justice League - but now, in additional reshoots later, the legacy of the blockbuster is being rewritten.

If I knew it is this bad, I wouldn't waste 4 hours on it. As in comics, DC is proving it's inferiority compared with Marvel one more time.", "So much better than the original release!": "This should correct most issues that you would have had with the original release.\nI genuinely enjoyed this film. Even with the near 4 hour runtime, I was still wanting more.\nAdmittedly, the CGI is quite poor. But if you can overlook that, you should enjoy yourself.\nI just hope that they can somehow do a sequel, because we definitely need one.", "Brilliant superhero film and best DCEU movie so far!!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an absolute brilliant superhero film and best DCEU movie so far. Very different than the theatrical cut. The pacing, action, acting, cinematography/visuals, and score are spectacular. Zack using every bit of 4 hours to build up the story & character development in a way that feels entirely earned.What got me interested in this superhero movie:Firstly, the action was phenomenal done and well choreograph! It's nothing short of thrilling. The action all throughout this film was perfectly shot by Zack Snyder.Secondly, Wonder Woman in this movie was hands down the BEST portrayal of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman so far. Such a strong, inspiring, and downright warrior. She fits into this film so well & Gadot's performance is top notch.Thirdly, the cinematography & visuals is an absolutely GORGEOUS with exceptional CGI. Zack's work never let us down. He did a phenomenal job shot every moment in this movie to look incredible.Furthermore, the score from Tom Holkenborg is absolutely mind-blowing. This man should be noticed everyone. His score which make the story and visuals perfectly and gorgeous. It is such a beautiful score that always make me in goosebumps. For example, Superman black suit flight 2.0.Besides that, Zack did a great job to the main villain in this movie. Steppenwolf is actually a threat and scary. He has motivation. He had a strong reason for why he was willing to do so.Lastly, every characters in this movie has their moments. I really like Cyborg role in this movie. He make me tears up. Zack was right. Ray Fisher was the heart of the movie. Flash also great and mature than what we got in 2017. Flash in 2017 is a joke. Batman as always BADASS like BVS. Ben Affleck such a perfect actor for this character. Aquaman also BADASS. Everyone in the final battle are actually well team work fighting against Steppenwolf.Okay. That's all. As I said, this is a beautiful & brilliant superhero film that is 100% worth the wait and worth watching. In my opinion, this is the BEST DCEU movie & one of my favorite films.#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE\nI will give this movie 9.5/10 \ud83c\udf1f", "Go ahead DC": "What a movie it was!! I can't explain how happy I am as a Dc lover. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96", "That's more like it": "The Joss Whedon version was garbage.\nThis movie is great. 4 hours don't care, this movie is beautiful.\nIt's dark and more intense, more mature and awesome how a DC movie should be.\nIs it perfect? Absolutly not, there a moments I dislike or a not good but I finally can ignore the Joss Whedon child version.I believe this movie is my favorite DC movie now, I even like it more than The Dark Knight Trilogy.", "We need more of this ...": "Finally a DC movie that doesn't make me cringe, I really enjoyed this movie and hope that we will see more like this from DC.", "The hype was equivalent to disappointment!!!": "It is soo bad! And that is coming from a guy who liked Green Lantern movie because I love all things \"super hero\", but this was just too sad to watch... First... All real explanations from original movie was removed! Here I referring to Batmans catching and investigating of parademons and \"Big guns\" talk about bringin Lois to Supermans revival... Removing and replacing Wonder Womans amazing soundtrack with... \"that\" awful sound/melody... whatever it was! Then Removing Batmans 1989 soundtrack and those references about time from that movie. The Flash was still running the same, and that is like he was in wheelchair for 30 years, and now he is trying to run with two semi broken knees... In my collection, this awful remix of a movie will not replace that movie from 2017.", "Less crap, but still crap": "I will sum up this movie by simply saying this. The only time I felt anything was when the Starlabs janitor died because he had a wife and kids. The only reason I know this is thanks the the absolutely STELLAR character development he received as Silas Stone left the the building. He was pretty much the only character to receive anything close to any sort of character development. Which is why, I was saddened when he was killed, but also why I couldn't give a crap about anything else that happens. A multi-million dollar exercise in vanity.

Shame on the previous director.", "this was one of the most pointless films ive ever seen": "Legit I only watched this movie because someones opinion I really respect said this was a good movie long story short it is not. It is the opposite of a pleasant view experience. At this point I'm sure a Busby movie directed by Zac Synder would please the brain worms in everyone who likes this movies head. There's no need for spoilers 40% of this movie is cut and paste from the last movie which at least had the dignity to be short as well as terrible. No I would never watch all fours of this movie and I wouldn't recomend it to my worst enemy because it sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. Fight scenes have no stakes tension or any coherent purpose. The writing was god awful like painfully so I audibly groaned so many times durning one liners and jesus Jared Leto as the joker again?????? It's somehow even more insufferable this time too. The amount of money time effort polish and rabid fan behavior should make this movie great wrong its worst than bad its a mayonnaise sandwich no flavor no point no meat just stale bread and some spoiled cgi sprinkled throughout.

WHAT WAS THE POINT?", "Bloatware": "I realize I'm in the minority but this movie was uneven, and not near the 10 rating that so many Synder fanboys have given it. It isn't the worst comic series inspired movie I've seen but, it's not the best either. Whereas Whedon's version drastically reduced the story line and left gapping holes in it, Snyder's cut went overboard providing long boring narratives to many storylines that could easily have used significant cuts. Sometimes I got the impression that Synder left some scenes in simply to be different than Whedon's version, and for no other reason. It also makes sense why Fisher and Momoa were upset with Whedon, many of their scenes were left on the cutting room floor (but let's make Whedon the problem rather than their own acting).\nAs for calling this high art, as some have done, a Rembrandt or Van Gogh painting is high art, this is simply a 4:3 format movie posing as high art.", "Justice Is Served": "Excellence from Zack Synder.. This was a whole new justice league..", "Better but bad.": "Its a better movie, sure. But it is certainly not an 8/10.

Oh and why did they decide Superman's laser eyes worked better with no sound?", "Far better than 2017": "This movie is 100% for the fans if you are not a fan I can guarantee that you will probably not like it.\nThe movie does have it flaws at points and cg can be a pit patchy but this is just so epic that none of that matters", "A movie to watch just once": "The 10's are clearly fanboys and the 1's are most likely upset about the failed attempt or they are trying to balance out the far to generous ratings.Ugh, where to start? Right off the bat the music choices will immediately pull you out of the feeling for the scenes. What in the world were they thinking?\nThen there is the complete overuse of slow and super slow motion. When used properly it can be a great tool, but this was a blatant misuse at times. Enough so as to create frustration.\nThere is particular car crash scene where a person from a dead stop, in a basically broken down junker, drives ahead about 30 feet and the scene is portrayed as about a 140 mph collision complete with explosions. In super slow motion no less. Good grief.\nMuch of the movie is edited in such a way as to feel completely disjointed. It just does not have a flow to it and it has a lot of extra scenes that are unnecessary to the movie. Isn't that usually the point of having such a long movie, to tie things together and developing the characters in a way that flows?\nI could go on and on about many other things, but why shoot a dead horse.\nI will bet that the rating drops off quite a bit as more come in because for some reason the high ratings are all shown first.", "Not again Barry": "The movie was a pure ten...\ni felt emotional watching all them sups in action!

Is it better than the original? Sure, but that's a low bar. Cyborg/ Victor Stone gets more screen time but the development of his character is still lacking. Aquaman and the Flash (remember that the Aquaman movie came a year after the original Justice League) are still woefully underdeveloped. Forget the hype in the intervening years: if this movie was released instead of the original Justice League, it still would've been a significant disappointment. It, combined with the stunningly bad Batman vs. Superman, have placed the DCEU in the weird purgatory of having a Wonderwoman and Aquaman that are too popular to start over but having ruined their other main characters to the point that the franchise will be significantly hamstrung if they don't reboot.

Absolutely, the first 45 minutes or should have easily been condensed into about 20.The characters have story, dialog, and motivation. Steppenwolf stops referring to the mother boxes as 'mother' and legitimately serves Darkseid. Darkseid actually has his reasons explained. We don't get the stupid, cringe worthy Whedon scenes or pointless dialog. Sorry Joss, but Batman doesn't quip. The effects are 1000 times better, and the final battle is actually fun because you know the actual stakes. Is it classic dark Snyder? Yes, but historically, DC has been the darker of the two major publishers.I had my doubts but this was worth the 4 or so hours and it was worth the effort everyone put in to get it released.Whats even better is, Barry isn't the sniveling coward he is in the Whedon version, he and Cyborg actually matter, even after Superman shows up. Speaking of, when he does show up, Superman does what Superman is supposed to do, which is help take care of Steppenwolf, he doesn't just suddenly start doing everyone's job for them.If a sequel isn't made, it will be a travesty.Did I mention? Dessad and Granny Goodness!!!!", "Unfortunate": "The Snyder cut and Joss Whedon's cut of Justice League have their own strengths and weaknesses, and in the end, neither are distinctly better or worse than the other. Between the two, there's a lot of content that should and should not have been cut out, equally but differently abysmal music, and, obviously, they both share the same, boring story.It's important to watch both of these movies and see the difference in a movie with and (mostly) without studio interference, but contrary to my prediction, I believe I prefer the Joss Whedon cut. Allow me to explain:This film's main weakness is it's extreme length. I didn't enjoy the shorter cut, and predictably, the longer cut was, for me, the same bad plot with a much longer runtime. In summation, Justice League simply isn't my cup of tea. If you love superhero movies, I'll just say that this isn't even close to as good as the Avengers films, which I also don't like (excluding Infinity War), but I'll go ahead and call the Snyder Cut a must watch if you love the DC universe. But, if you are an avergae cinephile, I'd tenderly recommend you spend your valuable time elsewhere.Here's a hot take: I thought the alternate, evil Superman timeline was extremely fascinating, moreso than the timeline in which the film primarily resides. After discussing this with my peers, I discovered that these moments were intended to set up an overarching plot for a series of films, and I would have loved to see that. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers canned that idea along with Snyder's original vision. Now, in terms of Snyder's vision and the additional scenes, I find that, in general, most of the additiona are unnecessary, poorly cut, confusing at times, and seemingly irrelevant to the plot. I look to the inclusion of Martian Manhunter as an example. I really don't get how that was necessary. However, most of the scenes (certainly not all of the scenes) that were already part of the Whedon cut have been enhanced by the Snyder Cut, though that has significantly more to do with money than artistic vision. And, of course, Steppenwolf has been improved massively, both narratively and visually. Still, though, his resolution was dissatisfying. Unfortunate.Overally, I think it's good to watch both of these films and see the difference in directorial choices, but I lack any strong opinion on which is \"better\". My only strong opinion is that both of them kinda suck.", "Better version but still not a great movie.": "I liked this much better than the 2017 release but two things that bothered me with the other version still bothered me with this one. So many similarities in the storyline to the Avengers movies. Even more annoying is that about 90% of the scenes are shown in slow motion and I'm not just referring to the Flash's scenes.\nEvery time a scene slips into slow motion it jolts me out of the film fantasy. Makes me want to roll my eyes. And what was the point of the film screen ratio and the muted colors? I don't think either of those two choices helped any.", "Bad.": "The other one was garbage. This is at least a movie. A bad one.\nDialogs are bad and cliche as usual. Conflicts and climax points were emotionally uneffective. Characters are hollow. Contains a lot of unnecessary scenes apparently recovered from dumbster. Bad screenwriting. Narrative was focusless. A dont like the slow mo sequences with licenced songs. They were like a dog food commertial.\nOn the other hand, this version takes itself seriously and show more respect to viewers compared to other one. Contains a lot of good eastereggs and comic elements. And some of them are very surprising. I found myself with a huge smile in some scenes as a hard core dc fan.I recommend you to watch this if you only want to waste your time in work or airplane.Good luck with the third try warner.", "The Movie We Deserved": "Forget the 2017 version and pretend it never happened. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED in a Justice League movie. Thank you Zack Snyder!", "The Masterpiece of Zack Snyder": "Now this is exactly what we fans are waiting for... The real 'Justice League'. Thanks to Zack Snyder. 4hours movie & fully engaging. Not just superman show. Every carecter got enough screen time & we can see all of there back stories, abilities and powers. Specially Flash and Cyborg's powers are just amazing that didn't seen in 2017's justice league. Carecter development is brilliant and the background music are the plus point and really heart touching. Can't miss it, just watch the movie.", "I'm sick of the critics bashing anything non-mcu": "This movie is amazing. I'm not a fan of zack snyder but he nailed all the tones of this film and it's heros absolutely incredible. Equal to the avengers in every way except the special effects aren't quite all there all the time, but theyre damn close.", "...and Justice for all": "Some time ago I have written a review for the theatrical version of Justice league stating that it was clearly not the intended vision but we were served with a quite decent WB animation like flick that was entertaining enough. However, as part of the Snyder cut movement, I too have been longing for this version to come out so that the world can finally see the conclusion of MoS and BvS.1) The acting. Compared to the first version there have been significant changes and improvements in character depiction. Almost all of the main characters are darker in tone and execution but are way more layered and have much more depth. The only one that has remained identical is Flash (his silly, goofy persona fits perfectly in both version, which says a lot about how Ezra Miler portrayed the character). Wonder woman is characterized with less emotions and more aggressiveness (resembling the BvS version) than the one seen in WW or WW84. Of course, it is hard to go back to the version previously known when these characters have branched out in different ways in their own movies respectfully. Aquaman was a bit of a rough cut in this version, straying almost a mile from what we saw in his standalone movie (a movie branched from the theatrical cut) but his likeable and \"dude\" persona is still present, only toned down. Cyborg, as was my opinion in the theatrical cut, was phenomenal. In this version, his portrayal only intensifies. His general place in the overall story is pivotal and Fisher understood this, portraying the character similarly but with much more style, coolness and depth in the Snyder cut. By far the most tectonic departure was Batman. I am still not quite sure if this movie was supposed to be a contrast to BvS where he had no faith and his humanity was lost somewhere (until Superman brings it back to him) but Affleck's portrayal in this movie is that of Bruce Wayne, and not Batman. Sure, we get Batman fighting and doing cool stuff in certain segments but the essence of the character in this movie was Bruce Wayne and not Batman. Steppenwolf is now a menace to be respected and frightened of. We are presented with a demigod that literally destroys everything around him and is unparalleled in strength and brutality. This is one of the pivotal reasons why the Snyder cut works and the theatrical doesn't. It has a masterfully crafted, written and executed villain.2) The story. Interestingly enough, the overall ark has not changed that much. So any further developments in the DCEU, regarding Justice League movies, can calmly continue the story. But, to be completely honest, this situation resembles the tale of Achilles and the turtle. If told right, it is a philosophical debate regarding Zenon's paradox. If told incorrectly, it is the same story, but the first one just makes more sense. That is also the case regarding the two stories of Justice League. The Snyder cut makes more sense and is a much more complex and intriguing story. The continuation of the story is not questionable nor are there necessities to be explored in different manners in the future. The Justice league defeated Steppenwolf, Darkseid is coming for us and Superman is resurrected. We have a fighting chance... or do we? But, for the sake of the movie itself, the Snyder cut is told in more detail and all of the actions of all of the characters are now completely understandable. We were given the answers to questions like: what are the motherboxes, why is Steppenwolf here, who drives him, why and what is to come next if the JL fails. The story also brilliantly sets the table for standalone features (which can be linked to the Snyder cut, the differences are there but they are not game breaking that the characters and/or stories are incompatible) and the continuation is clearly visible and possible.3) The music. Even though Elfman did a great job, Holkenborg kicked the ball right out of the park. He heavily leaned on Zimmer's themes, also improving upon them and adding interesting and complex segments that fit the tone and depictions of the movie. Both soundtracks are good, and both fit their movies respectively. I just prefer the latter one.. in every way imaginable.4) Editing. The most common critique is the length of the movie. Personally, the 4 h runtime was not a problem as the movie has a very beautiful and linear flow, making breaks and smartly pausing by introducing chapters (resembling a comic book). If this was to hit theaters, it is completely noticeable which parts would be cut out and which parts would be shortened, but in this format, it is really not an issue at all. As a matter of fact, I intend to watch it again today, the very next day after seeing it for the first time. So no, the runtime is not a problem specifically because of the format it was released on.5) The direction. One either loves or hates Snyder. There is no in-between. He is a visual storyteller and the amount of visual detail in this movie is remarkable. Most of his movies require multiple viewings to full comprehend and take in all of the little elements he put in them. I believe that this movie is the same even though the flow of this movie is much less complex than the previous ones. It is so straightforward and simple in narrative that it requires very little debating and/or thinking about certain segments (unlike the neck breaking in MoS or Martha scene in BvS). So, this movie is much more wider audience friendly than the previous ones, which is exactly why this is the version we should have received. The logic behind mangling this version the way they did is a complete mystery to me. The one thing that really does stand out are the fight scenes. They are choreographed to perfection, thought of, methodical and nerve wrecking. Every hero has exactly the same amount of time as everyone lese, and there is no struggling for screen time or absences. The fight scenes graduate progressively and climax in a phenomenal way. The punches are not held back and every single character has an important role in every fight scene. Unity in its finest. But above everything else, the fight scenes are extremely entertaining.All in all, we are finally presented with the true version of the Justice league. The one that really sets the story straight and sets everything on its way. It is really hard to find a flaw in the movie, to complain about something because the movie is simply put - really perfect. It has no delusions of grandeur, it is grounded, entertaining, straightforward, it has masterful character buildups and interactions, a ferocious villain and ties most knots together in a single understandable universe. Grab popcorn, grab a soda and just go and have fun. This movie will give you exactly that. If you loved what came before, you will adore what you are now presented with now. If you didn't like what came before, you will be entertained enough so that you can't say you didn't have a good time. Not a lot of movies can achieve that.As a finishing note - let this be a great lesson for future studio interventions. Artistic freedom must not be meddled with. Artist's visions must be seen through because only when you believe in your investment, even though it may take some time, will you get you investment back... and much much more. For now, thank you for letting us experience this movie. To Mr. Snyder I say this - your movie is the single greatest DC superhero depiction of all time.As a lawyer I must say that there a really few instances of true justice in this world, but this one... this is what true Justice looks and feels like.", "A Most Pleasant Surprise": "After the big disappointment of the theater movie I thought DC movies were going downhill fast. After hearing about Snyder's version I wasn't sure how this would be so I thought give it a try. I'm glad I did, well done all the way around from Snyder and puts the theater movie further behind in the rear view mirror. I hope Snyder is able to do more with this in the future.", "Such an improvement": "Worth watching? Yes 100%, it should've been this instead of the other garbage, there was a lot of cool things introduced but it will never be talked about again.", "Zack Synder Justice League": "A different perspective Indeed,\nYou feel Justice for the day, the characters stuggle is real and grounded.\nA VILLAN you won't be sympathetic towards, actually gets you feeling a need to be more human than ever.Only issue I have it was it wasn't long enough.\nCould have used an extra hour especially the Age of Heroes, Flash Back (History Lesson).Otherwise, it was a really good continuation of BvS & MoS.", "An awesome superhero teamup flick with story depth and rewatching value": "Let's just set the records straight. The story doesn't alter much from the 2017 version except for one key change. Glympses of a new villain. Other than that, it's the same story.However, the movie just depicts what a director, good VFX and great background can improve a movie. The movie realizes the full vision of Zack Snyder (which fans fought for years). The movie gives each character their own mini movie and each character is masterfully done. The biggest improvements are Cyborg and Flash. They have a full arc of story and proves their worth in the Justice League team.One thing I must add is the action sequences, VFX and beautiful cinematography. Fabian Wagner did an absolutely amazing job and the film's start at Nordic Area with Aquaman is absolutely fantastic to look at. Ben Affleck with his white bearded look and shades absolutely is the best portrayal of Bruce Wayne (Couldn't believe I'd write that anyone could best Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne).The soundtrack by JunkieXL is a massive improvement. It's tough to compose music for a 4 hour movie but the soundtrack compliments the action sequences and screenplay pretty well. (Would have loved to hear the original WW track a bit more though)If I want to write a review of the #SnyderCut aka #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague I must talk about the man himself, Zack Snyder. The man worked for free for the last 1 year just to complete his vision and give the Fandom what they wanted. Zack is probably the best visual story teller in Hollywood right now (James Cameron said he gets inspired by Zack in an interview).Despite being very talented and doing wonders, Snyder is one of the most misunderstood filmmakers ever. His movies are full of ideas that are lost on the superficial audience and the critics. He is like a comic book fan's wet dream. His movies carry the characters and have deep themes (same in this movie), and yet, he fully delivers on the visual style and bombastic action. The best of both worlds.The horrible irony is that people still hate him. Half the fans hate him and think he doesn't know what he is doing and the critics hate him because they aren't even trying to look past the bombastic action and dig deeper into the meaning behind everything.", "The DC we all want": "This is the movie i was always wanted to see as a DC fan ...i am a big fan of DC since my childhood so its the way it is ... People should know what dc truly is ..big love", "I mean, it was good but...": "It's no Avengers. Sorry but I had to say it. I do like both Marvel and DC Universes so I tried to remain unbiased while watching this.It is without question much, MUCH better than the theatrical cut. It's a very good movie still with flaws. Steppenwolf actually looks and feel like a REAL supervillain. He kinda steals most scenes he's in with his presence, even though he's heavily CGI'ed quite a bit more in this cut. A great improvement nonetheless.It's 4 hours long, not a fan of that. This is why Marvel broke up Infinity War and End Game. Just a lot for the eyes, even with the solid character development that is rewarding it's hard to make it all the way through at once. Binge watching shows is different, you have clear breaks in between episodes. This has \"chapters\" but they were blended together a little messily.Ultimately it's a solid superhero flick that is better than half the Marvel films but doesn't even come close to the better half. (Infinity War, End Game, Dark Knight & Rises, a few others are 21 out 10 if I'm rating this movie a 9)Casting Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is still one of the worst casting decisions I have EVER seen. Not to mention we bring back Leto as the Joker for 5 minutes at the end, when he was undoubtedly the least liked Joker of all time? Those two things alone keep this from being a 10 to me. Other than that? Definitely see it.", "10/9/8/7?????": "I can only assume the high ratings are from die hard DC fans or comic book fans in general because there is no way this should be rated so high!4 hour action movie!?!?!!! NO action movie should ever be that long. I could have sworn this was going to be released in 4 hour increments but maybe I misunderstood?Is it bad, not necessarily.\nIs it better than the original? Sure?\nNone of it matters because of how long it is and all the characters they decided to cram in, most of which have no character development and still no standalone for some.I always thought, and still do, that it was a mistake to do a \"DC Avengers\" movie before doing the standalones.Batman's character may work in the comics and certainly in his own movies but when you put him in movies like this where everyone but him has super powers, he's just pointless.Maybe it's just me but the CGI in this just doesn't work compared to what Marvel has done.And to wrap it up, where does it all go from here? Affleck was already gone, WW84 bombed, Cyborg and Flash have had their own issues in real life before even having standalones so will they get their own movies in this universe?To me this was all business. WB knew this would get a ton of hits and pull in $ however it works for streaming now and that's it. Overall, I'm glad I saw it but this is a 1-time my.", "A 8.5 for me - as a DC fan had a very wide smile after watching this": "After I watched its 2017 version, I had forced myself to like it since I felt that was the only JL teamup we were getting. When people asked for a Snyder Cut, I had thought 'its the same movie - move on with the story, make better movies'. But now that THIS exists - this is canon for me. I can now see what could/should have been in 2017. It has problems - but no movie is perfect. The runtime is double the original - but when you dont have singular movies to setup every character, you need the runtime. 2017 one cd have been 3 hours, lots of movies are.\nOnce again, the team works - but now its backed up by a coherent story, some goosebump inducing moments, better villains, better characters, better action. Gone are 'falling on a woman' and 'brunch' jokes - replaced with better character we can root for. A superior movie when compared to the original , a good movie when tied to its own franchise - probably the best in its series.", "Doesnt get any better": "You got your 4:3 ratio, your even worse CGI and ofcource a 4 hour run time.

I respect his vision and I think all the doubters need to try and respect it too.", "Longer but still sucks!!!": "Sorry but if you follow the comics and what these characters have been based on forever; this movie and the first one just suck. Sorry you don't stay on script from movie to movie its really sad. And you don't need a birthing chamber to save Superman he just needs the radiation from the sun. So that whole part was pointless.

Masterpiece or trash?": "Zack Snyder's justice league is one of the most surprising superhero movies I've seen in a while. I to be honest wasn't exactly excited for the movie. But as a film guy regardless, as well as a DC comic book fan, i was excited enough to go watch it when it hit streaming.\nAt the start of the movie it is already demonstrating a completely different tone. The last version was more witty and rushed, but this is slow and dramatic. The tone in general balances out the darker moments with the lighter moments. The pace is decent, the scene's all are long enough that they leave an impact, mixed with the great music score, gives off an artsy film at times. A lot of concern is the pacing, I have heard mixed things about it, but for my viewing (watching all in one sitting), I thought the pacing was well done, keeping my attention and not being bored. Characters have actual character arcs and story i.e. cyborg and Steppenwolf. Both having dimensional characters and heart. Steppenwolf want's to get on darksied's good side. Cyborg is so dimensional. He struggles with being in this body, and understanding it. He is the heart of the film as in one of my favorite where cyborg helps a lady with her financial troubles and discovering himself inside. Everyone else is improved also, Aquaman is less jokey and takes things more seriously, as well as empathetic. Batman isn't as jokey and actually transforms from BVS from a cynical killing machine to a hopeful guy with faith in himself and others. Flash is also a big change, having motives to get into the field of fighting against falsely accused crimes, again he has more too do than just pushing a family car around. Actually saving the day. Everything about character and plot is better.\nThere are flaws, as too why it isn't a 10/10. The pacing at the end, especially the nightmare scene, is good, but feels tacked on and unnatural. Part 1 and 2 have too much slow motion and licensed music over it, that it becomes distracting then when you look back, if you kept it at normal speed, we would have a shorter movie. Some points of the film it is like it skips forward to the point of, 'wait what did i miss?'. But it doesn't happen often.\nRegardless of the issues, i don't think it will ruin the film. After the second viewing it really does fit better.\nSo in the end, i believe this is one of the best superhero movies out their, better than the avengers movie, easily, And that is coming from a guy that really likes those movies. But this movie just speaks to me.", "Dark! Gritty and no cheese!!!": "So glad this version came out! Was so disappointed by the previous movie.

I got excited again. I've been a Batman fan since my parents let me see Batman (89) on vhs. And to see the team up of a man with gods to fight monsters was something out of the mythology passed down to us around a campfire (or long car ride).Justice League came out. Saw it opening night on the biggest screen I could. And.... I had that same feeling I did watching the first Avengers movie. And it hit me - these two movies didn't feel like the epic mythology I was promised. It didn't feel like I was seeing man and god team up to defend Earth.Fast forward to Infinity War & Endgame. I got the payoff and the feeling of catharsis in a movie theater.And tonight I experienced epic storytelling. Not in a theater as this film deserves, but in a comfy chair on a big screen TV.This team of artists weaved an epic in four hours. Just like there are novels, plays, comic books, concerts, and even tv shows that are events. This is event cinema for the fans.And this was made for the fans.Thank you HBO Max, AT&T, and especially Zack Snyder.", "Worth a try!": "The more time the movie runs the better the storytelling.There isn't much to say about this movie.

If your a DC fan then watch this masterpiece, you won't regret it!!", "No red sky at night, veiwer delight": "I give the 2017 Justice League 3/10, it was a horrible mess.Going in to the new cut I was thinking, probably nothing much has changed, I was wrong.The SFX are better, the cinematography is better, the score is better, the pacing is better, the story now has heart.Cyborg is now one of the best and now has an ark which reminded me of the animated DC movie Doom.All in all well worth a watch.", "\ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udcaf!!!!!!!!!!!!": "THEY CAME THROUGH!WB needs to fire whoever the hell decided to can Snyder. ATT, Nolan, Afleck and all the other producers saw through the political BS and pushed to have this project finished CORRECTLY. AND THIS IS IT!They told the story! It wasn't rushed (obviously 4 hours). Introduced the characters correctly. Introduced new side ones. Now all they need to do is finish the other 2 justice league sequels as planned.Oh and FIRE THE DBAG AT THE HELM OF DC/WB.", "A Cinematic Achievement! A Dream Fulfilled": "Zack Snyder's JUSTICE LEAGUE is everything fans wanted, and more. At 4 hours, the film really forges through. The visuals are epic in scale, not to mention the R rating makes everything feel very grounded. Blood! Very interesting to see old scenes recontextualized, which makes this feel like a brand new film. Truly a cinematic achievement!", "So much fun and so much better!": "I think we all knew this would be a million times better than that Josstice/Warnerbros suits stinker! That's a low bar. But this was so much better and such a different movie altogether! I love Zack Snyder. Man of Steel was the Superman movie I always wanted to see... when I was a kid the best we had to settle for was Smallville(still love that show) but there was nothing else. The Reeves movies were classic but horribly outdated and cheesy and Superman Returns was nothing more than a boring rehash of the Reeves movies.Man of Steel finally showed Supes in all his glory and power by pitting him against actual threats! AND it managed to ground the character without any of that cheese and corniness that I hated so much in the old movies.I loved BVS... I remember seeing it with a friend who wasn't at all into the superhero movies in the theater and she was on the edge of her seat right with me! The hate on that movie was ridiculous... people just love to pile on. I can acknowledge it had issues -- particular the final act with Doomsday but otherwise I loved it and the Ultimate Edition was even better!After seeing BVS Ultimate Edition and now ZSJL I'm convinced now more than ever that movie theaters are a thing of the past. Why should a director like Snyder be confined to a 2 hour cramming of his film. He clearly has a sprawling vision and I have no doubt that other directors at his level could benefit from streaming. The problem with popcorn flicks is that we're more focused on the popcorn than the flick. You know a movie is special when your hand hovers over the popcorn bag and you've completely forgotten about it.That's how I felt watching ZSJL! I literally only paused the movie bc my bladder couldn't hold out for four hours... otherwise I was completely locked in from start to finish. From the beginning the entire tone of the movie was different... all the silly, marvel like color - thank God it was gone. There were stakes... guys I was actually worried for our heroes. I actually laughed at myself bc I forgot where I was... bc with ZS... the heroes MIGHT not make it through. I'm not trying to trash Marvel... but we all know things will be just fine for the characters in that universe(Iron Man) being the lone exception.My point is just that I'm an adult and I feel Marvel really is a general audiences world. I like stakes, I like seeing these larger than life characters go through very real very human struggles... and as hard as it can be to watch... I like seeing them lose. But more than anything... I like not knowing how things will turn out for these characters!Another thing I need to point out about ZSJL -- WONDER WOMAN!! Now, look, I know a bunch of you will disagree but I hated both Wonder Woman movies... they were both corny. Terrible special effects. Terrible dialogue(\"I fight for love!) ugh! But I loved WW in BVS and she was absolutely BADA$$ in ZSJL... I mean that first scene that she showed up in! My jaw was on the ground! AND HER SWORD IS BACK! Dude, I thought this character was a lost cause after her two solo movies but this movie proved to me there is nothing wrong with the character or with Gal Gadot but the director Patty Jenkins and her particular vision for this character!It's so bizarre that this character is supposed to be the embodiment of female empowerment - the movie has a female director but somehow it feels like a complete insult to females. In both WW movies Gal Gadot is little more than a super hot chick with powers -- she does her model walk in slow mo - delivers terrible dialogue(I fight for love again) and that's it. So how is it that ZS somehow makes her what she's actually supposed to be?Anyway, I loved this movie! I loved that Steppenwolf was a legit character, with legit motives and man was he terrifying!(until Supes showed up lol!)Needless to say: RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE!!!! how could they not after this?!", "This is where the DC movieverse needs to go": "Gritty realistic characters that show the full range of the human condition and what is possible to achieve when the right team of heroes is put together and led.I don't want the sanitized versions of these characters, I want the versions that Snyder has brought to life.Do we now need a Snyder JLA2? Absolutely!", "Called it": "Jared Leto needed to stay in the trash with his criminally unfunny 2000s reach-around joke where he belonged along with at least a dozen instances of Ancient Lamentation Music, 15 minutes of slow motion and an hour of b-roll and clunky exposition to retcon a mess of a storyline.Also this movie deserves at most a 5, nowhere near 8 or above. I give 2 stars for the cast and crew doing their best with what they had and -8 for WB trying to pretend Justice League wasn't a bomb because it deserved it because they didn't bother building a solid film franchise first.", "Done Right. Bout time. Take the time...": "Okay finally a good version of Justice League. Just completely forget Batman versus Superman and the old crappy Justice League. It is long but he does a good job breaking it up and at least giving good character development and a true plot. Much more like the Justice League Warner Brother movies. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Everybody wants to say how it's overrated and almost the same as the other but they are wrong completely different. I can't wait for more Zack Snyder Justice League movies.!", "It is a visual, musical work, splendid frames, it is a visual poetry. Thanks Zack Snyder .!": "Finally we got what we deserve from Zack Snyder\nYesss, thank you Zack Snyder! THIS is the movie the DC heroes deserved... And the fans as well!\nIt's an amazing continuation on \"Man Of Steel\" and \"Batman V Superman\" and the story is splendid this way. Character arcs, worldbuilding, awesome effects... Note to Warner Bros: let Snyder continue this franchise. He really knows what he's doing! This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and it's perfect. Character buildup, plot, humor, climax, emotions in the movie is so great. I loved the movie from the beggining to the end. I love this movies.\nit is a visual, musical work, splendid frames, it is a visual poetry.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is fire": "WB you blind ..

To be human is a thoroughly pointless existence when you have characters that are insanely powerful.", "Well.........didn't we had the infinity wars.....ALREADY ?": "Although this cut is far better than the 2017 incomplete version we got from a guy who took over after zack \"left the building\" for a while due to personal issues that doesn't mean that we never saw those things before in former epic dc movies.\nunfortunately for zack and his vision we already saw those things in the latest avengers two films infinity wars and endgame.\nwe already saw the doom of the world the darkness the desperation the sacrifices....etc..etc\nthis is getting tiresome.\nthe only real value of this movie is that it's completely different from the 2017 version and so u can check out the differences here and there as only 20% is the same footage.\nI can guess for the die hard fans this will be a great addition to their collection but outside those fans I don't think this movie can add a lot to an already tiresome formula.", "Justice league we all deserve": "To all dc fans and superhero fans A perfect masterpiece", "So boring and long": "Well of course it's 4 hours long given 80% of the film consists on slow motion clips.The script fails to bring background to the plot in a fluid way as each scene seems disconnected from the previous one. This is worsen by the fact that some scenes are way too long and add nothing to the story.Dialogues are scarce and when they occur are very wooden or cheesy.The action sequences are fine though the CGI is mediocre at times.In any case, the movie never felt interesting but it is not a bad film either... it is just dissapointing but because of the unachieved potential this story had.", "So much better!": "Literally the only thing I dislike about this movie was the music.", "The fight was worth it!": "This movie is a powerful, motivational, and touching journey. Every character and their own personal struggle is credibly and smartly introduced. And the character arcs of already established characters, like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are very well continued.Snyder's visuals look, as usual, stunning, just like the visual effects, which is just an incredible accomplishment, considering the less amount of time the VFX team had to finish the CGI.Meanwhile, I don't think there's still a need to mention that this film is by FAR superior to the massacre, which was presented us in theatres, back in 2017.I cried, I laughed, I cheered. This is an emotional rollercoaster and I can only recommend you to watch it.In the end, all I can say is #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Lived up to every expectation": "The film was amazing, this right here was THE Justice League and all you need to know is watch it, no words can give you the complete experience.", "A MASTERPIECE, A TRUE MASTERPIECE!": "Can something be truly perfect?

From the action scenes to the music . I hope there will be a part 2\n. You'd have to be crazy not to make one.", "Better, but way too drawn out": "Having a 4 hour movie about the justice league isn't a problem. 6 integral characters and a main villain are a lot of people to juggle and contain in a single movie. The problem I have is how about an hour and a half of this movie is made up of slow motion scenes, random bits of characters walking to weird music, and characters imagining things that aren't even happening. During these scenes I wanted to turn my tv off and call it, but stuck with it because of my love for comic book characters. When these scenes weren't on I actually enjoyed the movie. The fights were cool and my gosh the visual effects are astounding. It's a decent watch but nothing special", "This is what a MOVIE should be like": "If future movies about DC heroes are not made this way, better don't do them. Zac Snyder, congrats, best movie of 2021 also one of the best things that happened so far. I hope you will continue doing the upcoming ones.", "Slow paced and full of pointless content.": "This Snyder Cut is possibly the worst directors cut of an already bad movie since \"Alexander\" being that it was inflated with slow moving exposition content that wasn't necessary.The final battle sequence was definitely a step up from the regular cut, but it also now weakens the Flashpoint story since Barry now already, twice in the same film, broke the laws of the speed force.Bruce's nightmare at the end is way out of place. It should have happened earlier in the film being that he literally mentions it to Diana.I still would love to see a sequel with cohesive vision, but this is far from the masterpiece it's been marketed as being.Zack Snyder is a fantastic director, no argument there, but his Superhero movies are all too slow paced and dark and absent of any light hearted fun.All of the actually funny moments from Whedon's version are gone in this, which is saddening because the Aquaman/Flash quips made up for the lack of Green Lantern Flash banter that comic fans are used to.Save yourself time and just watch from the final battle onward.", "Justice was served here...": "A phenomenal multi-superhero movie! We could connect to all the characters in the movie deeply. Cyborg and Barry's characters were developed and were justified to be the core of the movie. For me, this was the best cinematic experiences since a long time. Music is just so awe-inspiring!", "A good movie with many good things in it": "The movie is very good and and the character development is also very good. Each character is important and we can feel the presence of each character. Flash and Cyborg are developed very well. Wonder woman, Batman is also used properly and in few review people have complained that batman is not used properly but I have different stake on it. Batman is used as much as story demanded not more no less than that. I do have 2 complain about this movie that is as the movie was going to release on TV screen and most of display device are having 16:9 ration and shooting in 4:3 makes it difficult and 2nd some scene looks very long and i do believe that with proper editing movie could have been cut by 15 min at least without missing anything from movie.", "Mind-blowing!!!": "The snyder cut completely makes it for fans who has been disappointed since the last justice league...even though the movie has a duration of a long 4 hr...not even once we get bored while watching it\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcafConclusion:\nIts definitely a must watch movie!", "Best movie ever made": "Zack Snyder's Justice League has completely lived up to the hype. This movie has changed my outlook on life, shut the door on comic book movies forever, and taken the spot as the official greatest movie of all time. I could never recommend a movie more. Best movie ever made!", "It was the same movie...": "Someone told me I should see this as it \"wasn't even the same movie.\" Well, it mostly was.Ever watch Lord of the Rings, extended version? It is an extra hour, has many more scenes, but not much is different. Now Justice league is different in that sense, but not all that much. Plus, as the person watching me with it said \"it looks like a music video.\"", "What we should have got in 2 movies": "After watching this it just feels like how badly the first movie was made, considering the amount of potential this storyline has.....but I still feel that these DC movies explain too much instead of allowing the fans to think for themselves. All the characters speak out what they are doing before doing it which is too kiddish...", "Involvements and the new official Justice League movie": "*Don't let this distract you from the fact that they put in additional unneeded footage of Mera played by the known abuser Amber Heard*, who is also in talk to get her own show and has officially gained support from director James Wan (because he likes her...) to be included in Aquaman 2 and not have the role recast, etc. This is aside from several huge media outlets taking her side or avoiding criticism of the situation despite her actual abuse of actor Johnny Depp being public available material that everybody with access to the internet can look up. The severity of it is shocking, as is the support Amber Heard is met especially in continuing her role against what more than *1.5 million people* have wrote their signature in an official petition to have her removed from.Since this is the newest footage of her in this role and nothing at all is being done about it, quite the opposite, I've taken space in this review to speak up. I hope you will go out and actively show your support to disallow abusers to get away with their behaviour unpunished by any system and by the people, and to hurt Warner Bros who actively supports her, where it hurts, in their money pocket, since that's the only thing that will stop their hypocrisy and poor, biased treatment of this case against Amber Heard. *Thus do support by boycotting Aquaman 2 with her in the role of Mera and any possible Mera television show per this happening, as it allows an abuser succesfully avoiding punishment by the public and gain even more success and popularity in the Hollywood business.*If you are still in doubt about her actions or the severity of them, I can't do much here but recommend a quick Google search/YouTube search and look up photos, videos and articles showcasing the hard evidence, photos, videos, recordings which involve Amber Heard herself admitting to the abuse as well as Johnny Depp's severed finger, etc. The actual proof is there widely available, and your support will help bring justice. You've watched The Snyder Cut, you've watched these heroes, go take actions of justice yourself now, alright?*At last, I will speak for the movie alone and not Amber Heard's role in it.*The Snyder Cut has some of the most stunning visuals seen in about any superhero movie. It's where the movie is the strongest, when it combines its strong visuals with the depth Zack Snyder carves out for the characters.Unfortunately, it's hard to develop all the characters very much in one movie (even when it's 4 hours long). This means some of the character moments and lines fall flat every now and then, and we miss a bit more backstory to make up for the highly dramatic elements.Zack Snyder's Justice League still does a great job of fleshing out the story and the characters more than the cut that now nobody will watch ever again. Wonder Woman, Cyborg and the Flash are the standouts of this cut and bring a lot of heart and action.In conclusion, I think the movie has an epicness and stunning quality that's impossible to deny even for the hardest doubter of the Snyder Cut, so all I can say is really... Go see it for yourself and enjoy.", "You are all joking right?": "This movie is slow, the acting terrible, the cgi is horrible and just leaves the world feeling could because nothing feelings real. This movie adds nothing but violence and darkness to the Joss Weadon version. The only people this movie qill apeal to is Zack Snyder fan boys. The villians are still just as useless as the original with no more depth.", "Completely different movie!!": "Incredible vision by Snyder, it's what I was originally hoping for until his family tragedy and studio's decision to make the film \"lighter\" with director Whedon. My only complaint is the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, I understand for iMax it works really well, however this film will be seen 99% on HBO Max at home on widescreen TVs, or iPhones, tablets & computers. Doesn't make any sense???? Still a masterpiece & at 4 hours it's basically 2 movies like \"The Avengers finales\"", "Almost perfect.": "It's long. Yet you never notice it while you are watching it. Everything you wanted to see the character development the Easter eggs the action it is all here. It is non stop until the end and it sucks to see the trash ww we get now and the batman we have to look forward too... hope Zach and the crew get back together and do DC right.", "Must see!": "Absolutely fantastic! Definitely wish this was the movie we got in 2017. #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Unreal movie.": "Restore the snyderverse now! This movie was worth the wait, it would have been magical in the cinema. Epic!", "What I hoped for.": "This was everything I hoped it would be. It had better continuity and the storyline flowed. It was a 4 hour epic that that was paced perfectly. It goes to show just how much of a hack Joss Whedon is. I hope it will breath life back into the DCU and continue to develop into something to not just rival but to supplant the MCU. It was worth the wait to finally see this masterpiece complete. Please turn control of this universe over to Zack Snyder so he can continue to right the ship and share more of his vision with us.", "One of The Best Films of Our Time": "This is a story. A beautiful story of a live-action Justice League. The 2017 release was an extremely watered down and bland version of this movie. Zack Snyder's vision was what we need for this universe. The 240 minute runtime (4 hour runtime) seems to fly by once you're immersed into the story. And there is much more genuine emotion in this film. Deeper backstories.We got to see a Batman that builds a team. Aquaman with his mental tides. Wonder Woman making tea. A powerful black-suit Superman. Flash becoming his own man. And most importantly, Cyborg as a human. Darkseid!. This movie gives us all we need. The tone is even different. There's jokes, and fun, and still those dark elements we've come to know. I love this movie. And I hope you will too. Go into this with a clear mind, this is a comic book, a DCEU live-action adaptation, and it's a damn great film.", "Serious actors saying funny things": "Such a waste of resources. Actors sometimes look perplexed themselves on their lines. And some are actually not bad actors.If you want to make a movie with superheroes, audience need to accept from the beginning a set of exaggerations, but if you want it to make a good movie, stick to the necessary ones and don't overexaggerate everywhere: use adult lines, try to respect physics as much as you can, when adding things from other domains (informatics, physics) use an expert opinion so you don't say gibberish. Otherwise what you get is something worse than the cartoons. Good examples are the old predator and alien movies.Second, if audience accepts all your over exaggerations, under any circumstance do not try to do \"artistic\" or \"touching\" moments, remember it's the same movie where we accepted the bad guy who's an extraterrestrial who already destroyed 100k worlds and stumbled on earth speaks English with his master in lines a little worse than Narnia. Focus on things you CAN do good, and that is hack and slash with good effects. Good examples are Lord of the rings and Matrix.Marvel movies found a good way to compensate for all the gibberish, their actors look like they already know they will say gibberish but they do it in a funny and more acceptable way. WBs Justice League also kept an optimal time (no \"artistic\" moments) with the main content so we don't get bored with too much gibberish.A movie that fails all of this is Zack Snyder's Justice League.", "A small victory for the fans...": "I gave the original film a 2 out of 10 if that tells you anything. The 'Snyder Cut' of Justice League is infinitely better than the theatrical/whedon cut of the film, and is a shining testament to how bad Warner Bros. screwed this whole thing up.I didn't notice the 4-hour runtime because I was too busy enjoying the movie, it's pacing, the character developments and arcs, and a better version of the films antagonist to notice how lengthy it was; just to list a few things. After all, we've seen what happens when you introduce 3 new characters and then force everyone to come together and fight a villain crammed into a 2 hour movie; you get the 'Warner Bros./Whedon Cut.'I wish that we could get more of this 'Snyderverse,' and less Shazaam/Suicide Squad/Birds of Prey crap, but Warner Bros./DC has decided to make a hard, left turn into \"woketown\" along with the rest of Hollyweird, which has proven over the years to be such a great way of maximizing profits without alienating the general public.In closing, I just wanna say that I'm glad this version of the film now exists so everyone who helped deny it's existence, sabotage it or badmouth it can now see how truly wrong they were. Glad that in the end I got the movie I wanted. A small victory for the fans...", "No movie should be 4 hr with only shades of black and red.": "Definitely an improvement over theatrical release but the runtime makes it a headache than a entertainment. Why can't Jack Synder make a movie with real world colors. What's with shades of gray, red and brown. Its irritating and headache inducing. Jack Synder must go. Aquaman was an amazing movie. Synder's negativism has ruined DC. Moreover, no DC movie can be good with Superman. That's what I call the God problem. How do you make a movie when one character is basically God. They should learn from Mrvel which is fun, entertaining, colorful and much better character development. Only some wanting to be different fans prefer DC. They should reboot everything. This movie was OK. But 4 hr.... Come on, its not Lord of the Rings.

Why the format was changed to 4:3, there is no reasonable explanation, except perhaps to draw a time parallel with \"Wonder Women 1984\", which is not really an explanation, because it can only carry a negative connotation.Is it better than Marvel's 2018 \"Infinity Wars\"? Of course not. Is it less disappointing than the sequel \"Endgame\" from 2019? Certainly it is. Does it fix the bitter taste in the mouth after watching \"Wonder Woman 1984\" from last year? Well, maybe, for a nuance.The recommendation is, if you liked the original version at all, you should take a look at it.

They could have probably trimmed this movie to 3:20 but apart from that it is hard to find big flaws. It carries its weight all the way through and the final battle is astronomicaly better and more tense then the 2017 one. It also makes way more sense story wise. Snyder successfuly makes the character better through adding character building scenes which Wheaton cut out for cheesy bad jokes. It gets a 8/10 because some scenes are a bit of a drag and could of been cut out to make the run time at least 30 min shorter. The ratio is amazing btw in my opinion.", "Happy to see RealCut": "Yes!

Too many details, too much time, too confusing.", "Watched it twice. Same feeling.": "This movie was not perfect, but dang it delivered. It keeps you wanting for more. I watched this a week ago and I have been watching all the reviews and glad they were as surprised as I am of how the story turned out.", "Definitely an improvement, but not a masterpiece": "The Snyder cut improves on many things from the original like the action is better, the effects (with some exceptions) are better, the acting is really good, the tone is more consistent, the music is way better, the villain has more of a motivation, and has genuinely amazing moments (everything with cyborg, flash turning back time, and the final battle). But the thing is, this could have been cut down hugely and still be good. There is a lot of scenes that either are pointless and add nothing or are mind boggling in the worse way (Martian manhunter raises so many questions, darksied is cool on paper but in the film he does nothing that warrants his inclusion, and the nightmare sequence is terrible from Jared Leto still sucking at being the joker to building something up that may never come true). I like it don't get me wrong and I'm glad Zack got to make what he wanted to make, but in my opinion this is not the masterpiece.", "MY GOD": "I've just watched a masterpieceI want morewe all want more", "Batter than Marvel!": "Have yet to see the movie, but i already know from the trailer this makes Marvel look like trash, and i'm saying that being a huge Marvel fanboy.", "Worth the 4 hour watch": "Short:\nThe previous cut had a lighter tone while this is the darker, more sombre version.Long:\nA plethora of changes in this version including costumes changed, some new characters not seen in the previous version, introduced. Quite a bit of gore added. Dialogues replaced with new ones in the some of the same scenes as earlier, implying alternate cuts were filmed simultaneously. In the 2017 version, many characters did not have a significant role due to cuts. In this all the characters play equally significant roles. Flash & cyborg have lengthier roles in this which alter the outcome of the story significantly. The comic lighthearted, even cheeky dialogues of 2017 are replaced with more serious and dark ones.\nIn 2017, many people including me were left confused with unexplained time jumps in the cinematography. Those have been fleshed out here. More detail has been added to Barry's character and his abilities. Steppenwolfe's suit & CGI has been modified to add a more sinister, villainous appeal. Superman donnes a different costume in this version.In all, plenty of changes, multitude of added scenes, alternate dialogues, even the ending is altered greatly. In my opinion, worth the 4 hour sit-through.Only one down for me; no 16:9 AR(Zach deliberately kept it at 4:3). Still Id give it an 8/10.", "Surpasses my expectation": "I truly thought the 2017 release was bad. They tried to turn a DC movie into a Marvel with light hearted (bad) jokes. I wasn't going into this new (original) version with much hope. I've now watched it 4 times. It's just that good. It's the DC movie we deserved. It's dark and gritty as DC should be. There is some well placed humor unlike 2017. I'm now a strong supporter of restoring Snyder's vision for this universe. There is too much potential not to move forward with his vision.", "Is Zack Snyder's Justice League Justified?": "1. If you gave this dragged out garbage a 10, what do you give The Godfather? What do you even give the Nolan Batman trilogy?\nPersonally I rated this compared to every action film after the Matrix. Saying that how can you possibly give this a 10 compared to the Daniel Craig Bonds, or even the first 4 Die Hard films? The three Thors and Nolan trilogy? Even the first Wonderwoman, and Aquaman though for different age ranges are clearly better stories in the superhero and action genre. So if one is comparing this to all post Indiana Jones, Superhero and action films only, and you're going higher than a 5 you have no taste in film. Because if this is a 10 what are the Nolan Batmans? What is Inception? What are the first 4 Die Hards?\nI rated this amongst the superhero genre only. (If I included overall adult action PG-13/R this gets 1/10. Albeit better than the theatrical release (which isn't saying much at all) still doesn't make it a good film. Since the 300 films I haven't been entertained by anything directed by Snyder not Man Of Steel, not Batman vs Superman and definitely not this.\nI didn't enjoy all the Marvel Films some of them stank, some were funnier and entertaining some where purely for kids and people who want to have a Migraine for a week from 3D CGI in an IMAX - so positive reviewers who say \"if you beg this film you're a marvel fan\" I say I'm a film fan and want to be entertained. This was not an entertaining film at all.\nThis film alone\nProblem 1 cinematography:\nThe Problem is it's 2021 most TV owner's even if not at 4K and still on 1080p want 1.78:1 or 2.35:1 aspect ratios not letterbox format. I have a 55' 16:9 like most so for 4 plus hour feature which requires special effects for this genre 1/3 of my screen's width shouldn't be wasted.\nProblem 2 I'm aware there was much debate to present in color or black and white. With the aspect ratio black and white would have made sense and given it and \"old school\" feel. The CGI was so obvious as well that it may have looked less ridiculous in black and white. On top of making the choice not to make it in black and white. Then there's not normal coloring either, perhaps a compromise. It's as if it was filmed through polarized sunglasses so the color is distinguishable but it's lighting is somber and depressing making it hard to stay awake. (Changing the setting to Dynamic doesn't make a significant difference- it's a \"dark film\" so it's filmed with a dark feel).\nSo far we're presented with a R rated hero film now to me that means there has to be a sense of mockery and foul language (satire) there is neither. That leaves sexuality or really violent. I found nothing violent that is different than a loony tune cartoon. (Taking content and characters intended for children and making it targeted for adults is not an easy task). I simply don't get the R rating.\nSteppenwolf's introduction like the original movie emanates from \"the boxes\" on wonder woman's home island. There's been no attempt on making any improvement in terms of realism... There's been no full explanation as to why now does Steppenwolf appear? There is no explanation of what his betrayal to Darkside was, and a very week backstory as to why conquering Earth would place him back in Darkside's good graces.(Because 5000 years ago Earth was the only planet to vanquish Darkside).\nThere is nothing scary looking or intimidating about the CGI work or the raspy microphone echoing of Steppenwolf's voice. He remains just as irritating and annoying and the voice doesn't range with much emotion or anger either. Compared to Marvel the CGI presentation is far inferior to that of Thanos or The Hulk. Klingons are scarier looking.\nIt begins like 2017 with an embarrassing beat down on the Amazonian breed of women... but extended. Even Wonder Woman's opening scene tossing the explosive was Obvious horrible CGI on the level with something from the \"Arrowverse\".\nThis goes back to black and white definitely would have been more suitable for this film as it was in \"Sin City\". Color doesn't work in R rated heavily laden CGI film.\nSo in terms of the cinematography though I bring down the first 45 minutes it applies throughout the remainder of this bombastic chaotic 4 hour mess of a story.\nCasting issue: I felt very strongly about this when Batman vs Superman was released as well as the \"Definitive Cut\" Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor not only a poor physical choice based on cartoons and comics... but he is more reminiscent of Jim Carry's \"Batman Forever\"'s riddler with acne and a higher level of ADD and more irritating than comical. He doesn't come off as narcissistic and sinister, but as a spoiled bitter brat with resources. Not the over confident intellectual with a well planed and calculated sinister plot.\nBen Afleck... after Christian Bale, Ben Afleck regardless of his personal conditioning, doesn't do Bruce Wayne well at all. He's Batman in and out of the costume. His \"darkness\" isn't convincing either with his puffy cheeks and heavily cleft chin.\nThe movie has a different feel after seeing Aquaman (though this takes place before his solo film). And after the first Wonder Woman.\nIf one is choosing Cyborg over the Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter (Though I have no understanding as to why) He needs a movie as does the Flash (sorry Arrowverse TV doesn't cut a Flash intro for film).\nUnlike the first release there's much mourning for the Superman. This obviously this becomes the center of the story in the first 15 minutes of hour three after the first encounter with Steppenwolf... I'm yelling \"STOP HITTING AND GET A DIGITAL ERASER\".So though back story for Flash and Cyborg is given more attention it's not sufficient enough to satisfy Or explain if they're ready for this kind of confrontation.So you get to the two hour mark when you get to that initial battle with the Justice League minus Superman. Though I have more background info and the story has more structure - I'm bored out of mind, from dry acting (outside flash) and the CGI and the fact that the five heroes never fought together- with the Amazonian CGI battle at the onset 90 minutes ago and the short Atlantis one fight scene 45 minutes ago, these \"fight scenes\" don't translate into good cinema or action.\nSteppenwolf with his raspy microphone voice is not intimidating but irritating. Plus how evolved is Flash there's a pointless scene where he saves Iris but he's being quite underutilized power wise as is cyborg...going back to the question how ready are those two? I guess Batman wants some meaning or purpose beyond Gotham scum? He nearly killed Cavil which would have been awesome.... instead Doomsday does and the Superman sacrificed himself!!!\nYAWWNNN 150 minutes in and there's nothing that can happen that will improve the pace of this film. I'm simply waiting to find out what earned this a R rating.\nIt's lame and awful with more clarity than the theatrical release.\nI'm surprised this broke 50 on metacritic.", "Better than the 2017 version, but not the best": "Probably a lot of you will disagree, but scrolling through the first few pages of reviews and only seeing 9's and 10's had me wondering what film you saw. To be fair the budget was micro in terms of superhero films, so what they achieved was impressive. But unlike some of Snyder's other films I don't think i'll remember much of this film. IF ONLY THE MUSIC WAS BETTER!Steppenwolf is far better in this version and seeing Darkseid was pretty cool. The long runtime made the story make way more sense than the 2017 version, and i'm all for it (watched it all in one sitting). And probably the biggest praise I have to give the film is making Cyborg a character I cared about.As for the films drawbacks I have to say that it's somewhat slow, but understandable as it's supposed to set up the sequels that Snyder had planned before everything happened. But unfortunately because of this it feels like the movie that was supposed to come after was the one I was looking forward to. The worst part of the film for me was the music because it made good scenes seem a bit stale. It's probably because of the forgetful music that I'm not rating this film higher. I gave Batman V Superman a 6 as well, and this film is better, but it's less memorable. There aren't any scenes that I'd say are bad in Snyder's Justice League, but there aren't any I loved either, unlike BVS with the doomsday finale, courtroom explosion, and Lex Luther's talk about demons coming from the sky. Don't get me wrong, this film doesn't piss me off either like BVS did, but the lack of good music is frustrating.There probably won't be a sequel but if there is i'm all for it.", "Worth Seeing at least once.": "It was much better than the original and I enjoyed it, but I'll never watch it again or never think about it again. The Flash still has his movie coming out, but I hate the costume, all the lightning effects, and don't really care for Ezra's performance; and I get that this was him still learning how to be The Flash, but I got tired of him tripping and falling down.I'm glad Snyder got his redemption and got to fix it to his vision. But this dark & brooding style seems to have run it's course and I'm ready for them to refocus and try again. Anything could happen, but I don't believe they'll continue on with the Snyderverse. I won't miss it.", "Finally the depth we have all been looking for in superhero movies.": "This was such a redemption title. It awed me, brought me to happy tears, surprised me on so many corners.The depth of each character.I hope Zack Snyder gets endless power and funding for whatever he wants to plug energy into next.I went from being so angry that the original release was such a Hollywood fluff, and ruining my childhood dreams of live action Justice League, to feeling like I was 10 again watching the cartoon.", "Best Movie in the DCEU": "The movie was just perfect according to me and it could not be more beautiful. This is way better than the previous Justice League movie which was released in theatres and was directed by Joss Whedon. The original theatrical cut is often referred to as the \"Whedon Cut\". I really like the direction,the effects that was used and the much detail story that make the fan understand it more easily. I am giving this movie which is (4 hours long) a rating of 10/10 Stars and I hope that Zack Snyder continue the good work to help to develop the DCEU that fans are eagerly\nwaiting to See in the future years.", "Justice Has been served.": "As as lifelong DC fans this is everything that I asked for. It is a marked improvement on the dumpster fire of a movie we got in 2017. Each character has their own arc and every hero contributes to the ultimate goal. Superman is not the ultimate savior flash, cyborg have equally important and fleshed out contributions.", "Thought it would suck. I was so wrong.": "Really blown away! How could WB look at the Whedon cut and go yeah thats better. This film as great action, amazing characters, great villians and a decent story. It also sets up a sequel and I really want to see it. Thank you Zack Synder for serving these characters justice!!!", "PERFECTION PERSONIFIED!!!": "The saying substance over style is pretty well known I'm sure. But when it comes to Zack Snyder's Justice League the saying changes to Substance & Style.\nThis is a DCEU film that I've been waiting for since my love of comic book films were a thing. I'm not a Marvel fan or a DC fan I am a Superhero fan.\nAfter watching this however I'm torn as to which I think is superior?\nZSJL or Avengers Infinity War!!!???\nAll I will say now is the action was visionally stunning and powerful. Not saying anymore just well done Zack Snyder for bringing this into my life \ud83d\ude0d", "Best SuperHero in history blows weak marvel away": "Film of the year! we have waited for years for this moment and we have won with our movement. It has everything a superhero film needs and more and it now stands as the longest and greatest superhero film to ever be made and not even the weak child made films could reach this level.. If you don't like dark superhero films or even DC or Snyder than this film is not for you ..stick to the PG 13 only marvel films.. Now granted Deadpool a awesome R-rated film which i can say is near as good as JL...JL is far longer and better and DC and Warner Bros need to get with the times and make what we the fans ant not what they want ..they work for us not the other way around and keep making these types of film like JL 2 and 3 and as for the haters let them eat static.. When it comes to marvel Justice League accomplishes in 4 hours what took marvel 9 films to to get to their first avengers film.. This film now real and the haters better get used to it.. You have so called fans like Jody's corner who claim to be fans but bashes Snyder and his fans for making a awesome film.. This film rocked and that is a fact deal with it...

The storyline is much richer and more logical. I cannot stand the old version which is just empty.", "Zack snyder''s version is way better": "I didn't really think this would be any better since I don't like man of steel and bvs. So Zack Snyder's third dceu movie really just got me thinking if I'll watch it. I'm not like hyped for this movie but of course I'll watch it. The 2017 Justice league is not like bad but it's a sort of mediacore movie that is bright and has a bunch of dumb Josh Whedon jokes that just don't work for dc characters. Not to say that I hate jokes in movies but it just doesn't really fit the tone of the other Zack Snyder dc movies.OK time for the positive stuff of the movie. Zack Snyder's Justice League is of course better than the 2017 one. The main thing in the Snyder cut is that it's four hours which is giving more screen time to most of the characters especially cyborg and flash who just like side characters I didn't really care about. Now everyone is like focused at some point. The action is fantastic the spectacle and cinematography is great and the movies finale is way more epic than the 2017 version. Stephenwolf who is the villain of the movie has more personality than just getting motherboxes because he's bad. This time collecting the motherboxes has a purpose other than taking over the world. The r rating is not really necessary but it's still good to see a r rated Zack Snyder dc movie it's full of great stuff in it.Now time for the negatives well this movie is good but Zack Snyder just likes his slow motion and used it a little too much that it slows the movie. Wonder woman's new music is a little unnecessary if it's like used in every scene with Wonder Woman. It's not too long I watched it in one go and was like is it over it doesn't feel long at all. The so called cliffhanger is not to exciting even though I still wish to see what Zack can do with the dceu which is changed in at good way by this movie.", "A Snyder Masterpiece": "This superhero epic consists of a dark storyline, an incredible entrance for a new villain in the DCEU, and an intense and brilliant score by Tom Holkenborg.

Hopefully Snyder's new Zombie movie will be better.", "What a film": "People say this is better than the original when this is the original and not that hack job joss whedon did, God for what he did to this film after seeing it for what it was ment to be is a crime its self.", "MEGAAAAA": "Although 4 hours long it really didn't feel it and was truly a pleasure to watch from start to finish!", "Wow.. just wow..": "I was expecting that at all... i thought i was going to watch the old crappy version, took some popcorns and drink. And then ... wOWthe first 5 minutes alone are a pure master-chief, nobody talks, just the shots the musics, the characters' sadness... pure ART.That's what this movie is, pure art. 4 hours long weren't enough, i wanted more!!I felt like i was reading a book, a marvelous book well written and all its characters, their perfections and imperfections, everything was perfectly balanced.Even my girlfriend who hates super heros movies couldn't leave an eye off from the screen.Definitely my favorite super heroes movie.Good job to the team behind the camera, you guys are magicians.", "Very Impressive.": "Wow, I can't believe how good it was. It was a completely different movie. This should have been a two part theatrical release. Why WB changed it is mind-blowing after seeing this cut of the film. The characters were significantly better and well placed within the story. Cyborg was way better. The biggest difference was Steppenwolf, I thought he was dumb and annoying in the first but the Snyder cut made him so much better. The story was better explained and laid out. The only complaint was the drawn out somber singing scenes.I hope WB sees there error and brings Snyder back to do more. Thanks to everyone who made this happen.", "Better, but still awful": "Straight to the point... the cgi is horrendous. The over powering voice of Steppenwolf is irritating and the really annoying theme that's played every time wonderwoman enters gets boring very quick. English terrorists with no plot saying very American things like 'city blocks'. Obviously apart from the big names, no other character development in the universe made the characters irrelevant.", "The best movie": "This movie was great and beautiful. The special effects are excellently designed and I personally enjoyed it", "All I hear is, yes, daddy, in these reviews.": "Please, calm down. I just wanted to walk into these reviews without needing to take a shower.It was a good movie. Retcon should have been the sub title. Retconned like a boss on creative pills.

The cut is giving you totally new perspective compared to the cinema version.\nIf the version would run in cinema it could have easily pas the 2 billion revenue and come close to Avengers End Game.\nEven after 4 hours I couldn't get enough and would love tho watch some hours more.\nI like the the cinema version and didn't understand the critics. But after watching the Snyder cut I realized the critics. It goes much more deep inside the Characters. How they get who they are and why they are doing things they do.\nThe epilogue is sensational. It is just a tragedy that there is not going to be a sequel based on the ending of the Snyder cut! The fans would love it!!!", "A Masterpiece... Of Bad Pacing": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a master class in storytelling and infinitely improves on the theatrical release. The writing, directing, acting, comedy, drama and cinematography are all highly improved aspects in this movie. However, this film's largest issue comes with it's pacing. The 4 hour runtime in unnecessarily long and at least an hour from the first two acts could have been cut. Overall ZSJL was a truly incredible, albeit long, cinematic experience.", "If only DC could be free of it's idiot overlords...": "Finally we get the movie as it was meant to be.

Truly an amazing film.", "Makes Endgame look like child's play": "No lie, Synder's Cut makes Marvel's End Game look like child's play and this didn't even include Darkseid.Endgame was long, it was predictable, it was kids friendly, it was too funny for me to take most of it seriously. But with Zack's cut, he really captured the moments. Each character was true to their original self esp Flash. And the fight scenes where so bloody, it gave it a sense serious business. It had it's funny moments too no doubt AND to even think that Darkseid didn't even feature in the main movie but they still manage to pack it with so much action, that was like the steal.Can't wait for the sequel, maybe in 4 years time \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I seriously can't wait, hopefully they get to fix that horrible looking Darkseid. Buttttt OMG, Deathstroke looked so amazing.", "Release the Whedon Cut": "I demand they release the Whedon Cut!

Sure with beer and laughs how bad it is you can watch this, but as a DC fan this is a total embarassment!1. Batman. This actor is the worst Batman of all time. Even Clooney's. Clooney knew he couldn't do a good job, but this one believes he does a good job, making this a total cringe. The writer almost knew NOTHING about Batman to write such a script for him, completely ignoring what Batman is. I watched his moments with the expression of WTF on my face.2. Wonder woman. She is the reason that people in ancient Greece banned women from participating in plays! That.. bimbo just can't act. It's like a chinese driver stereotype but true. Sure she looks sexy, but that's all to it. And her \"sexy\" is stupidly discomforting to look at when she hadnles bad guys. It's like a 12yo girl trying to act in bdsm movie. Can you imagine that? But it would be the same acting as from her. I don't care how her armpits look, but she CAN'T FREAKING ACT! Is hollywood so poor on good looking girls that at least went to a drama school.3. Flash. For god's sake please fire those people who hired him. 1st role and it's terrible. Flash is like a Dick Grayson, he has his talking charm. CHARM, GODDAMIT!!! NOT BEING A FKING IDIOTIC CLOWN. Of course, most of it is in the script, like when he dodged a sneak throw from Bruce Wayne. HE DOESN'T HAVE SUPERSPEED REFLEXES, HE ONLY HAS SUPERSPEED! Fire those idiots who wrote this. This is embarassment. It's like writing that Aquaman can fly.4. Aquaman. This is the least annoying actor. I can't say anything bad about him. He is almost the only one who knows how to present himself in a movie. But once again, terrible script. His character is not realised. Not in 2 hours, not in 4 hours, not in 24 hours if the same people who wrote the script would write it again.5. Victor aka CGIborg. Despite many millions spent on this movie, even people who make CGI fked up. WHY! Please somebody tell my WHY! Why a liquid terminator made 30 years earlier looks more human than todays cyborg drawn in CGI? The black guy whose only and only job was to make faced... did an awful job. THERE'S NO EMOTION THERE.God fking damn it. WB, you have really fallen lower than netflix.I don't recommend watching this movie if you're a fan of DC. IF you're a casual who doesn't know that Batman doesn't use guns, it's okay, even better than ok. At least there's a story in here. If you can sit through all 4 hours of partially boring dialogues.", "Totally different movie!": "This movie was phenomenal! The storytelling made way more since than the first version. I would have paid good money to go watch this in a movie theater. Even if they had to split it in two parts.. One of the best superhero movies of all time in my book. Great job Zack Snyder", "Vindicated to non believers": "But to the ones like myself who spent the last few years fighting to #releasethesnydercut its a Victory. In binge culture, where people watch entire seasons of tv shows, Zack Snyders Justice League proves that a 4 hour movie can tell a fully fleshed out story of individual superheroes becoming a league. Zack had this vision and through his own tragedy, he completed it. A visual and immersive tale of triumph. This is definitely a major part of history. And I'm glad I was part of it.", "Definitely what we were waiting for": "No unnecessary-childish jokes, no stupid civilian saves; badass actions, better story explained, cooler heroes, more appeared.Definitely what I was was waiting for.", "Snyder took a broken concept and created gold": "To all superhero and or comic book fansThis movie is everything the original cut failed to be.I cannot stress enough how good this wasTruly amazing and yet at over 3hrs long, still enthralling to watchThe extra scenes such as Flash's job interview and subsequent meeting of his soon to be love interest just makes for a better experienceMr Snyder i loved it.", "Intense. Darker. Grittier. Grounded. Better.": "Unarguably the best Superhero movie ever according to character arcs, the brilliant storyline and subplots. Sets up an entire universe beautifully and the cinematography is top notch. The score not only enhances the scenes but also brings out the hidden depths certain comic book based movies are afraid to take. The dialogue is scholarly and rational, the jokes land and it brings you to tears when it has to. The pacing, action, acting and the visuals are consistently magnificent. Every bit of the 4 hour build up & character development feels entirely earned. There was not a single second that bored me. Every characters in this movie has their moments since these are perfect representations of these heroes! A must watch for fans of action, drama, comic book superheroes and filmography in general.", "Credits Going Up And Tears Going Down.": "A film that broke all existing barriers that could be broken! A film made for fans, where there is no specialized critic in the world that can describe the feeling of watching this work of art.\nThe only thing I have to say to the DC community, my brothers and sisters in battle, is: congratulations! We did it!\nAnd to finish what I have to say to Zack Snyder, thank you ... thank you very much! And may true justice be done to you !!!\n#RestoreSnyderverse", "thank you mr snyder": "Just simply: WOW. before I never really bothered with all the things going on around the movie and its making. being a more of a Marvel fan, I just found Justice League weak but okay. now knowing that it was more of the studios compromise version for the theaters I was excited to see the Zack Snyder Version and hooray, this is really really good stuff. there are stories that show a lot more background and deepness in the whole project. I never felt bored or wondered how much longer will the movie go on. not once. great work really. if it were in a normal format and not the 4:3 which I really don't like, it would be a straight 10 out of 10. wonderful entertainment, thank you Zach Snyder.", "Trash, Just Slightly Better": "Better than the original but still not good. Too long, the story is muddled, and it suffered from what all DC movies do- it just isn't fun or good.I fully embrace bad, fun movies or good, not fun movies but you can't be both. Batfleck is still awful. The only good thing was the Joker", "The pieces just don't fit together.": "Could have been a lot better quite easily, but it wasn't. Shame as there was a lot to like but it was only just watchable.", "Stunning....worth to watch ..!!!": "Incredibly aligned, perfect story , great theme..amazing action....everything was worthy...zack ..u have done it...and proved it that DC is still the best\n..!!!", "Here we go": "What we got the first time wasn't what we wanted what we got now is what we needed\nAbsolutely amazing movie.", "AMAZING!": "The best of DC comics and better than another marvel movie", "Better than the orginial but nothing spectacular.": "Once their honeymoon period gets over with this film, the fans will realise its more of the same. For the moment it will be 10/10 galore.", "Beyond expectations!!": "What a wonderful ride. A humongous leap. Story makes more sense in this one. Grittier still entertaining and has right amount of action. Do enjoy it at your own pace.", "\u00bfCan perfection be described?": "This is a masterpiece of audiovisual production, its 4: 3 aspect is unique in its category, well implemented, without disturbing at any time, plot carried out to perfection, open ending with possibilities for more in the DCU, it is incredible what Snyder did, just amazing.", "A significantly better movie than the previous one, but still not good enough": "It is very hard for me to criticize this movie, because i think it is exactly what it should be. A movie that is perfect for the fans that wanted it to be released. However, I think this movie has its issues. First of all, I have to say that the cinematography is quite great. I think that the colour grading is pretty slick and I think that it was a good idea to minimize the usage of grey (A lot of Zacks movies tend to overuse it). When it comes to the score, It is obviously good, but at times it can feel a bit out of place. But overall, Junkie XL did a very good job. Now I want to get more into the story and the characters. Well, even though the story is good enough for basic CBM fans, it just wasn't good enough for me. The story is the basic \"bad guy attacks Earth, the team of heroes has to unite, because if they don't, they'll get their asses handled to them\" and I have to say, I am over it. Now, I don't blame Zack Snyder for using this type of story, because usually this is how CBMs are. And I think that it would be perfectly fine if the characters were compelling enough. A lot of people are saying that Cyborg and Barry are the best characters from the movie and I have to agree, but that doesn't mean I don't have issues with them. I think that Cyborgs character arc could have been great, but there is simply not enough time for that. If you want to build this type of inner conflict, you have to let it breath. You have to show enough of Cyborgs issues with his dad and himself, but also, you have to show a lot more of the dads point of view. And I think there are a lot of scenes that seem forced, ingenuine and not that original. And a lot of this applies to Barry aswell. I don't think there is enough time to properly polish his relationship with his dad. I think that it would be a better idea to have him as this kid, that is a little bit confused and new to all of what is going on and have him be \u00e4fraid of messing things up and thinking that he isn't brave enough. And for example, you could've had Bruce as his mentor, that is basically telling him what to do and that everything is going to be alright. That would have been great for him, in my opinion, but instead of that, we basically get another character with daddy issues. And I have to say, there are a lot of people that find these characters great and full of emotions and that is great, but I feel that if you are hard to please in that aspect and you are looking for complex characters, you won't like these charaters as much as some people do. Now I'm going to go quickly through the other characters. Superman isn't enough in the movie to say anything that special, Aquaman just seems like a standart badass that doesn't have too much depth to him (that applies to Wonder Woman aswell), even though Batman is introduced as this team leader, he doesn't seem to have that much of an impact on the team, meaning I don't think he was necessary for the team to work (but that is quite subjective) and Steppenwolf feels more humane, but still he doesn't seem like that much of an interesting character (he feels basically like Darkseids side chick). The dialogue can sometimes feel cringe and unnecessary, but it can also feel really bad at times. Now, what is the summary of my review. I think it is a movie for Zack Snyder fans and also fans of CBMs and action fantasy movies that aren't hard to please, that want these epic and massive glorious scenes. Because of the surprisingly good pacing, this movie is enjoyable to a certain extent and I think you should definetly watch the movie to form your own opinion. But I'm warning you. If you don't care about action too much and you're focused more on dialogue and stories, you won't probably enjoy this movie that much.", "Now I need MORE of this!": "One of the best movie of our times but i need more from Zack Snyder in this universe.", "Nothing could save this...": "Not even an actual Superman or Wonder Woman could save this, and not a \"Snyder Cut\", this movie is like the fifth performance of the day from the Donkey in Tijuana.", "Why did Warner Brothers turn this down?": "This movie was 300 times better than the whedon cut and if this came out back in 2017 DC might have been able to be restored with the multiple movies that were supossed to come out after the true justice leauge but for some reason they let a drunkard offender try to do justice leauge in 2017 but all things said this movie is literally great with improvements to vital charachters that were just left out in the theatrical cut such as Cyborg finally got to show what they were made of. The teamwork is awesome and the fight scenes are magical and in this movie I cared about every single one of the charachters.", "KAPOWWWW!!! This is comic book movie at it's best!!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is THE movie that we expected to get in 2017 but didn't. From the pacing, the character buildup, the storyline, VFX, score, everything was TOP NOTCH. Definitely one of the best comic book movies ever made and Mr. Snyder's best one thus far. It is now imperative that Mr. Snyder is allowed to continue and finish his vision. We want to know what happens next. As such, #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "was this necessary?": "I would say nobody asked for this...but actually u guys did. And now look what we got. I hated the original, i hoped that zacks cut would fix it, but it still looked awful and had no soul. It kind of remindet me on the rework george lucas did on star wars. Fix the important stuff, and not a dance scene in jabbas palace please!!!. Who cares!!!!!! And what a fail to change the format. So stupid and arrogant. Why did nobody stop this. We pay a lot of money for big tvs so use the screen my god...redicolous.", "batman vs superman batman returns": "I am so happy i get to experience this master piece all characters dark no unnecessary jokes or cringe worthy dialogue except when arthur points a finger at barry other wise movie takes itself serious which is a good thing.", "An absolute delight!": "This movie is awesome! It is so wonderful to see Zack Snyder finish his movie they way he wanted to! Having seen Josstice League in 2017 when it came out in theatres, I felt it was a bit weird. I am glad to see WonderWoman as a badass! Cyborg had a lot of character moments! Thank you HBO Max for letting Zack do what he wanted. Thanks to the fans!", "A proper Justice League movie.": "Satisfaction at its finest. Thank you so much, Mr. Snyder.", "I NEVER REVIEW ON HERE BUT WOW....": "This was so much better than I anticipated it to be. I couldn't even finish the first justice league but this is so much more superior. Kudos to zack Snyder, hopefully he can complete his trilogy.", "The \"Must-see\" version!": "Fortunately I couldn't quite remember all the details of the cinema release of Justice league which is where I saw the original release. However, settling down to watch this a few nights ago was the real deal. This is the version by rights that should have been released from the get go.\nIf you are looking for an adult superhero film which ties all the superhero stories together nicely. I cannot fault the acting, screenplay, soundtrack and overall storyline hence the 10 stars.\nIf you haven't seen this film yet then why are you reading this?! Grab a bucket of your favorite popcorn, settle into your sofa nest and switch your phone off for 4 hours. Get ready for a cinematic ride that you only experience with a true epic such as this.", "This is the true Justice League": "The movie is perfect. This is how the things must be st the begining. Not 10 because is too long.", "Perfect tribute to autumn": "This film is a masterpiece.\nIts a perfect tribute to autumn snyder.\nI was engrossed for the whole 4hrs zack snyder's vision of justice league is what all DC fans thrive for and really hope there is a part 2.", "Best of the best": "Finally a Justice League we deserve\nMASTERPIECE!\nMASTERPIECE!", "An overly long, but otherwise massively enjoyable epic": "I've not been a fan of the Zack Snyder's DCEU. I despised Man of Steel, and I only enjoyed maybe 2/3 of Batman V Superman.How pleasantly surprised I was to find that Justice League is a truly good film. I really enjoyed it, and I think it and its director deserves all the praise it's getting right now.Zack Snyder seems to be at his best with extended run times at his disposal., Watchmen Director's cut was amazing, and BvS Ultimate Edition was infinitely superior to the theatrical release. The same is true of Justice League, and here he crafts a well fleshed out story with some genuine character development and back stories.Of course, it's not a perfect film. It is HEAVILY indulgent, and if I had a main beef, it's that it really did not have to be four hours long. It could easily have been 3-3.5 hours if some of the masses of slo-mo shots had just been trimmed down a little. There's some really long exposition sections where we get a history lesson too, and while it's nice, I'm not sure it's entirely necessary as everything just grinds to a halt for 5-10 minute to accommodate them.I also feel that once again Superman is by and large ignored, and I think that's been the way from the start with this franchise. He feels like a background character in this world, reduced to montages and fleeting moments where we see Henry Cavil's ruffled brow, and it's hard to buy that he's seen as this important by the team of the public.It feels like there should have been a second Superman film prior to BvS to let us really get to know him, but they rushed in and killed him in order to get to the good stuff.There are also one or two scenes and music cues which I still prefer in the 2017 cut, but regardless, Justice League 2021 is a truly great watch which is massively enjoyable. It sucks that we still have to see Amber Heard, and even worse with a terribly butchered English accent, but she's not in it for long.Bar a largely unnecessary epilogue and too much slow motion, this is well worth checking out.", "This was what the fans wanted": "I enjoyed watching a movie that made sense lol. The character development was great. They didn't make the Flash a crying wimp. Cyborg's story was solid and the action scenes were way better then the original. In all, a great movie to watch for comic fans.", "4h of boredom": "Oh. My God. This. Is. Boring.I guess you have to be a DC fan to enjoy it. For the rest of us, this is a hard pass.", "Everything DC": "When it's the DC universe, literature and film. This is pain, character, darkness, hope... at its absolute best. Emotional and evoking. Powerful and imaginative. An amazing achievement by a great filmmaker who understands the universe and has battled through everything to make it a masterwork.", "The Justice League we deserved": "It may run at 4 hrs, but to die hards, it doesn't feel like it. It's weighty in all the right ways, does the characters all justice, and is able to keep you fully engaged for the entire runtime.The only downfall I can give the movie is that it relies too heavily on the idea of the heroes being gods to non-metahumans. The slow motion, iconography, and worshiping is played to give it almost a religious feel and the comics never did that. But still a great watch, nonetheless. It almost erases the entire Whedon fiasco...almost, if THAT wasn't bad enough to become infamous. Snyder is able to reintroduce all of these characters, squeeze in a few more, and actually do them all right and allowing you to care about someone who only has a couple min of screen time.", "This is the movie that was meant to be released": "Without saying too much, this movie is epic, intense and incredibly well done. While still essentially being the same movie that released in 2017, it feels vastly different and adds a ton of interesting content that viewers will love.", "Bigger and better!": "10x better than joss whedons version. Fingers crossed for Justice League Part 2 \ud83e\udd1e", "Hell Yeah...... One of te best cinematic experience. It was like we are in a DC heaven": "One of te best cinematic experience. It was like we are in DC heaven", "HOLY AMAZING FILM BATMAN!!!": "Ok. This version, one and only version is amazing and what we deserved. That crap bag Whedon out together is nothing compared to this. I'm already watching it again!THANK YOU ZACH!!!", "Simply genius": "I will tell you this i have watched it 2nd time in 48 hours. 2nd time is even better. Masterpiece", "Entertaining.....but": "We all have been cooped up without any good movies to watch. This was long awaited but did not need 4 hours. The slow motion being cut out could have saved at least a half hour. And the music every time Wonder Woman did most anything was annoying. I admit I was hoping to see more from the Joker so I watched it to the end anticipating his entry. Jared Leto is under rated in his role. His make up was amazing, his lips looked as though he had been eating flesh, loved it. I think they were trying to make him like Joaquin Phoenix here. The back stories were great, looking forward to seeing Barry Allen and Victor more. Superman should have waxed his chest if he needed his shirt to be off. CGI was over the top. And why is the lighting always terrible in the DC films, needed the slow motion just to make out what they were doing. Also can someone tell HBOMAX to update from Dolby 5.1 so we get a better experience when using surround sound. I had to sit in the front row of my theater room to hear it.", "Absolutely incredible": "I don't even have the words. One of the best movies I have ever seen.", "The Rise of the Justice League": "I enjoyed every minute of the movie. I hope that Snyderverse can be possible to continue this adventure with the same cast. Thank you for this masterpiece", "Every minute of the 4 hours is great!": "My first impression was \"how can Zack Snyder think he can keep a DCU fan's attention for 4 consecutive hours\"? Especially since I own the previous movie, and have seen it a few dozen times. His vision of Justice League kept me glued to it for the entire movie: better development of each of the characters, more realistic action, better special effects and especially CGI, better depth of trama - all of this made me become absorbed by his vision. I really liked the prior version, but this one is way better. I have just one critique - I love to have a better view of the environment surrounding the characters, closer to what we would see with our own eyes in the real world, so I really missed the widescreen view since Snyder selected an old 4:3 standard screen format.", "Give me the Snyder Verse!": "An absolutely amazing film! Snyder delivers one of his best films and advances in the same footsteps of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. It's not even worth comparing to the theatrical release, that movie was garbage. Snyder must complete his vision! #RestoreTheSnyderVerse !!!!!!", "I don't remember the previous one": "Absolute masterpiece. I don't know what they were thinking releasing that crappy movie before. Oh this was must needed", "Boring, why is the DCEU so bad?": "I don't know where to begin...is it better than the 1st take? I wouldn't say so, you could say for arguments say that the plot is nowhere near as messy but Iean other than that, it's just boring. Overkill on the cgi that looks horrendous BTW, I mean now that WB added an extra \u00a370million to get this cut finished the total budget is around the \u00a3370mill mark...INSANE, I've seen better cgi in the early 2000s..I'm not a Marvel fan boy or a Synder hater. I loved 300, Watchmen I actually liked BVS( Ultimate edition) but this film is a mess..how can they get a group of the best hero's in 1 film so wrong I don't know. This needs fixed and I mean the DCEU, I love the fact its more aimed at adults than Marvels happy meal films but fix it. I'm not one for remakes reboots call it what you will but please get the dceu fixed, everything from Suicide squad to this has been below par and on paper they could be great films.", "Wonderful": "If you like DC and you want to be entertained, this movie hits the brief.Wonderful to see Snyder finally release his vision, and it's vastly superior to what Whedon did.The film has heart and soul and is a true development of the two Snyder films that came before.If you liked Snyder's Watchmen and the director's cut of Batman v Superman - this is a must watch.", "4:3 Two for the price of one - Equal to Endgame": "This is not what it is.Gathering the DC universe coherently. Having it make sense.This is a 2 or 3 on the best movie scale. This is a 12 out of 10 on the - never you mind, we're fans - scale.Does this movie make any sense? Yeah, kinda. Is this movie in any way similar to the film under the same title from 2017?Eh. No? Kinda?2021. You have four hours? Like Batman and Superman? Why not watch this?", "A Big Improvement but": "Why the muted color and old style aspect ratio? Really made it difficult for me to watch. Maybe it works better on the big screen but on a TV I dont care for it.", "Zack Snyder thank you": "Finally a much deserving DC level short. Looking forward for the future by Zack Snyder only period! .", "Exactly what you'd expect from Snyder": "Is it a story told in a more coherent way than the OC? Absolutely.Is it still an amalgamation of one clunky scene followed by another clunky scene?Is it still filled with dialogue, characters, and their emotions, written in blunt crayon?Will you, as a full grown adult, feel moments of embarrassment at how on-the-nose some of the emotional (and musical) cues are?Have the story telling and plot beats all the subtle nuance of a 4 year old telling you about their day?Is the action stunted and lifeless and the CGI horrendously outdated?Is the only person in this film who remembers how to act Amy Adams?Will you shout \"Get the feck on with it!\" more than once?Unfortunately, absolutely. Yes to all of the above. And the worst thing is it looks, from the epilogue, that there's more to come from Snyder. Talking about failing up. I'm just not getting the love this is getting. Maybe people are just surprised that it is at least coherent and in time, like Joker before it, the ratings will level out a bit.", "Wow!! So epic": "Thank you Snyder!! That was an absolute treat. Everything DC fans have been missing and waiting for. 4 hours long but I didn't want it to end. Just pure gold for the DCEU. So much potential and excitement for future installments as long as Snyder is there to guide them.", "Better in many ways, but still pretty flawed": "It's an understatement to say that this four-hour version of a film is better than its Frankenstein'd predecessor - I mean, it would have been a catastrophic failure if it hadn't been.That being said, there are still some things about ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE that are a bit smelly. And since I don't want to take too much of your time, here are my observations in bullet points:THE WRITING: While at times decent and mostly focussed, the writing sometimes plunges to garbage level. Now, let's not focus too much on the plot here - it's ridiculous anyway, but it's comic book fantasy, so maybe don't get mad if this isn't CHINATOWN. But especially the dialogue is quite bad at times, many gags are pretty lame, and many instances could have been fixed by tighter editing. Does this last line work? No? Snip snap.THE DIRECTING: Zack Snyder is highly gifted when it comes to visuals, but in the character interaction you can see his limitations. The writing comes into play as well, of course, but some beats are so naive and clumsy that you can't help but cringe a bit.THE VISUALS: Well, most of it holds up pretty well, but let's address the elephant in the room first. Why is this in 4:3? Most viewers will have a TV set that has a wider display - we're not in the 80's anymore, Zack. Most shots would have looked way better in a wider format; at least 16:9 would have been needed. Most of the camera work was absolutely fine, but some decisions felt pretty forced, like for example the way the Joker's scene was shot. The VFX were pretty decent, even though you could see that some of them had to come together pretty quickly.THE SOUND DESIGN: Mostly decent, but a few too many cinematics. It kinds takes away from the epic scope if you have a bass drop every two minutes.THE SCORE: Despite my pleading and desperate praying, Tom Holkenborg still gets these gigs. What is it with this guy? His \"arrangements\" sound amateurish, his harmonic progressions are too basic to invoke any subtlety or a wider range of emotions, and his \"Leitmotif Mickey-Mousing\" is plainly ridiculous. The most obvious example would be Wonder Woman: whenever she does anything, the score goes to the \"ethnic whining\". Yes, every time. Absolutely astonishing. His \"orchestra\" is a poorly programmed MIDI sequence, everything else is BIG DRUMS and SYNTH BASS, yay! Is it that hard to find a decent composer these days that you have to resort to an amateur like Holkenborg? And although there are times when his score goes by unnoticed (fortunately), this is an unacceptable way to score a big tentpole production like this.So, there you have it. If the movie comes with your subscription, sure, go watch it. If you have to pay separately, maybe wait for a discount or something.", "Justice is FINALLY served!": "Wow! What a difference a fan or two can make. I remember sitting in the cinema in 2017 watching Justice League thinking \"I thought Joss Whedon was supposed to be carrying the Snyder baton, making this in the same style and tone?\" I left very underwhelmed, annoyed and upset for Zack Snyder. His work tarnished by a so called comic book fan.Fast forwards to 2021 and here we are. It's finally here Zack Snyders Justice League. Four glorious hours of superhero goodness promised to us in BVS. This film has all the trappings of a great movie, distinctive Snyder style and some great moments of heart, levity and action!Batman leads the charge to stop an attack from Steppenwolf and his boss Darkseid. He must assemble a team of heroes to help him take on the threat. It also means trying to bring back the fallen Man of Steel. If it sounds familiar to Josstice League then you're right. Where he stripped away the diversity and the creative storylines Snyder had clearly (and lovingly) put together to weave his magical superhero tapestry, Snyder is now allowed to complete his vision and give us all the narrative threads Joss saw fit to tear apart.Gone is the stupid humour, gone are the idiotic attempts to make the Flash seem like a punchline. Gone are the idiotic one liners and gone is the bad taste and texture Joss added to the film. So too is that teribble looking Steppenwolf.Now we have a coherent story, one which allows all those narrative threads set up before to be fulfilled. The CGI designs are much improved, Darkseid wets the appetite and the action is intensified. Suddenly the Snyderverse is looking once again like a real thing!I have to give credit to Ray Fisher whos ark in this story is finally given the dues he deserves. As Snyder has always said, Cyborg is the very heart and soul of this movie and no longer the side character Joss Whedon made him out to be.It really amazes me how much was chopped out and butchered by Whedon and Geoff John's. How could ANYONE believe their version was superior to what Snyder had been building to since Man of Steel?Ben Affleck shines as Batman here and gives a performance that is now in line with what we saw in BvS. Gal Gadot is fierce in this film. If WW84 left a bad taste in your mouth believe me this will redeem Gal here. Shes stellar in this! Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller add subtle moments of humoir and heart in equal measures and now its earned rsther than forced. Both characters benefit from Snyders retooling.The score. Wow. How wrong could Danny Elfman have been for Justice League? This new score by Junkie XL who has been with Snyders series since Man Of Steel brings back familiar beats and adds new touches to ones we've heard before. A vast and superior addition for sure!In all this is everything you could want if you have been clamoring since 2017 to see this. Zack Snyder presents what to me equals a masterpiece of superhero cinema. Warner Bros need to shake themselves for ever doubting that this man had anything but the very best intentions for this movie and these characters. I hope Geoff Johns and Joss Whedon are watching all the hype and the fan reaction. You guys thought you had won the day but now... Justice is well and truly served!", "Marvelous!": "I'll best honest, when I first start watching the movie I didnt expect that much. I was like its \"probably overrated\".

And finally, props for not making Batman the focal point.", "E P I C": "This is an epic adventure with themes of loss, sacrifice, uniting\nA film that should have been released in 2017 has the time to shine\n~ its time son FLY ~", "RestoreSnyderVerse": "I am very very very happy after all this wait...

Theatrical version sucks!All hail King Zack", "Snyder might have redeemed DC": "I remember watching the Josh Whedon JL and I absolutely hated it. When I heard that Zack Snyder was remaking it, I was shocked. When I heard it was going to be four hours long, I was having a heart attack. I knew I had to watch it, no matter what. I watched it with my entire family (only two others knowing anything about DC) and I enjoyed the movie so much. At first, I wasn't so happy about the thought of sitting there for four hours to watch a DC movie, but I enjoyed myself. They improved almost everything, from acting, to characters, cgi, and story. What I love the most is that they went more in-depth with Cyborg and Flash, while the other JL completely ignored their character. My whole family (who usually don't care for superhero movies) enjoyed it as well. The only thing I had a problem with was Ben Affleck's Batman and why other than looks, he's nothing like the Batman in the comics, but that is very minor when you compare it to the entirety of the movie. Great movie, highly recommend it.", "Wow Zack...Wow": "Ohh Zack! You brought peace to my soul. An wonderful movie, The best in Superhero genre.", "Amazing Story and Justice for these Characters": "This movie was amazing. Period. The story flowed beautifully and made sense, every character had backgrounds built, the pace was perfect. Great build up and the end was mind blowing. Waiting for the sequel that was set up and so many potential spin offs. Thank you Snyder!", "Greatest comic movie": "This is without a doubt the greatest comic book movie made since the the Dark Knight. This is also the best team up movie ever.", "8.2 LOL": "The rating is just hilarious holy cow this is stupid.", "Same thing": "It got 5 stars because I like the cast but the movie was sad the same movie with a story line that means your ideals sucked and it's the only thing you could come up with.", "Rubbish": "Even worse than the theatrical cut.

I'm sad to say they don't even compare ..Which leads me to this movie. The coronation of the SnyderVerse. The ultimate showdown. I had some hope, I really did. Not much I'll admit, but a little glimmering spark of hope ..But oh my god what a bloated mess this was .. so many cringe worthy lines, so much ridiculous posing, so much bad CGI. I feel like I need a shower and a huge dose of Marvel movie magic right now to cleanse my body from this utter piece of filth.", "Imaginative but...": "It's simply a series of clever CGI over the top graphics, disjointed, mindless, utterly boring.

Who is the moron who did that? Anyway whomever had the foresight to give more money to restore this version deserves a promotion because not only is this way better then Avengers ...but Snyder hooked up you guys with 2-3-4 new movies !!!! If you continue do NOT WASTE ZACH SNYDER POTENTIAL. THE Whedon version never should have been made.", "A True Work Of Art": "An absolute masterpiece of a film. 4 hours of great story telling and depth in characters, with stunning visuals and cinematography.4 hours for a film sounds like a lot and exhausting, but it is truly the perfect amount of time. Everything unfolds at a very nice pace. The backstory of the characters is very well told, it isn't just 4 hours of superhero fights, it puts you on an emotional level with the characters, because the story is told in such a great way, that you have an understanding of each of the heroes as individuals. Heroes aside, the villians were portrayed in a much better way, as you are given a much clearer understanding of WHY they are doing what they're doing, and the introduction of Darkseid was great for fans of the DC Universe.The whole aesthetic of the film is fantastic, a very dark, true, real feel to it. A much more of a serious tone to it, unlike Marvel's equivalent, Avengers. While I do love the Marvel Universe, the difference between the two franchises is perfectly summed up with the Snyder cut, as I'm sure people will agree with me when I say Marvel films are filled with a lot more jokes and light heartedness in some scenes. Snyder's cut has a more gritty and darker look into the world.What Snyder has done with this film is breathtaking, and I am most certainly looking forward to the next film he makes within this DC Universe. We have been left a lot to ponder on, and I can't wait to see what's in store.100% worth your time. DC fans will truly appreciate what has been done here. A true cinematic masterpiece.", "Epic Movie. Spectacular 100!": "One Word - Genius !That was the movie we were looking for!!\nAmazing movie that which explain the whole history and complicity of justice league.Please give us More.\nI enjoyed every second of the movie, it's been A while since I enjoyed that level from a movie.", "Poetic, visionary, sensible and powerful. PURE CINEMA. PURE ART (AND \"HEART\").": "A poetic, visionary, sensible and powerful piece of cinematic art. Zack Snyder's vision finally materialized and it tastes like nothing else you've seen before... Every frame of the movie is imbued with a mythical energy that grabs you from beginning to end.Of course, if this genre of movie isn't your cup of tea and if you feel already ready to hate it, then don't waste your time & energy. Because it is a very singular piece of art that might not convince everyone, but it tells a coherent and meaningful story. Being seduced by this piece or not, it is a redundant & superficial debate in the end... What I see, hear & feel, while watching this movie, is a cinematographic piece that is true to itself. It follows a strong idea and is fuel by a lot of good feelings. Zack Snyder's immense passion for his craft resonates to the greatest extent...What a vibrant movie ! Every character shines, everything makes sense and leads to many epic moments you could not expect ! It has very few in common with the theatrical version (aside from some specific plot points), the way the story unveils before your eyes flows smoothly and is very tasty... You have very delicate and deeply human moments, but also moments that are action-packed or even totally 'metal' !! And wow it is oh so enjoyable !! It doesn't feel like 4 hours and hour after hour there is this crescendo that leads to a finale (the last hour is pure delight, in particular the last 30~40 minutes which are a total bliss) of the most amazing proportions ! The way the action and fights are constructed is very clever and nicely entwined with the storyline, it makes every new scene more satisfying that the previous one...These iconic heroes are baddass, yes, sure... But they all face their demons and have to step up, not simply on a physical standpoint, but moreover on a deeply emotional standpoint. They all excel and/or are demigods in what they do, but the answer is located somewhere else... And the way it all develops isn't clich\u00e9 nor is the simple recipe that many finales have...Zack Snyder has given all of his heart in order to add layers into every scene. He tells you this mythological tale with a great faith in what he obviously loves ; and like an artist-painter, he paints every frame great sense of both the details and the big picture. I've always liked and respected Zack Snyder ; but movie after movie, he proves that he is quite a genius visionary. I'm not saying he is the best (everything is subjective), but I very sincerely think that he is a complex artist, driven by powerful ideas, immensely passionate... And it shows, because he is able to combine action & emotion in the most artistic way. The photography & power of his catchy visuals mirrors the actions & choices of his characters in the most organic way. And you can see the connection he has with his actors and with everything that is going on in the frame/picture.Also, I wanted to add that -of course- it is rewarding when have watched the other movies, but it also can be highly enjoyed as a stand-alone piece. This 2-times longer cut automatically offers a lot of elements that make the whole piece far more cohesive and satisfying on a big number of levels...I'll finish by saying THANK YOU SIR, THANK YOU MISTER ZACK SNYDER for such a cinematic achievement... It's artsy, it has heart, the adventure keeps you on the edge of your seat, and every character serves the greater picture in the most epic way. It's a mesmerizing adventure, an emotional journey ; and once you reach the finale, you're pumped-up and it's just so good... Throughout the movie, you open your eyes over Zack Snyder's vision, and it allows you to appreciate every slightest bits or scene with a deep satisfaction. I thought it was gonna be very good, but it was impossible to foresee that it was gonna take these proportions and go in these specific direction... IT IS GREAT CINEMA. Not just blockbuster, but CINEMA in its purest form. ART.", "Let more directors release the true vision": "Light years better than the original release. The plot actually made sense this time. Zack is so gifted.", "WB shouldn't be lost faith and copy Marvel formula": "Finally, the mystery is solved. The instant feeling is: What were they thinking in the last version? The whole DC world got lost and we finally see the light. Snyder is always good in his own way instead of pleasing everyone. His vision is totally different from movies in the same genre. This Intricated yet intriguing piece of art is meant to be controversial. Is it too long? It is sensible that he divided it into different parts within the four hours. In each part, Snyder artfully put the different interludes portraying the characters without convoluting the main storyline. That's why he thinks four hours long is not an issue. He handles it very well. All the characters regain their demeanors and the performances of both Wonder Woman and Aquaman make their respective solo movies forgettable. Now, the Snyder world can continue.", "One my favourite Zack Snyder's movie #RestoreTheSnyderVerse": "This is probably most intense movie I have ever seen. Lots of surprises and nothing rushed. I wish there is continuation. This movie is epic and I have one word: #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "One of the most compelling superhero team up movie": "I wasn't really excited about his movie as I didn't knew about the #releasethesnydercut movement. But when I saw this movie I had tears in my eyes. So many jaw dropping moments and cool action sequences. Even the slow- mos were great though a bit overused. The starting was a little slow and boring but after ch-1 the catches up it's pace. There were many exposition in the film but the thing was that there were so many stellar sequences in these scenes that you forgot about the whole exposition problem. A great film to watch.", "Snyder brought DCEU to life.": "Thanks a lot Zack Snyder, for this\nMuch appreciated.Brilliantly covered almost everything in the movie, Fabulous job\nI still think, What the hell was Whedon thinking before releasing 2017 version?", "COMIC BOOK MOVIES AT ITS BEST": "You're either a comic book movie fan or you're not. If you are, at four hours long, you will get your fill on this one. Comic book plots, heroes, action and visuals at their best. My only negative? Get rid of the black suit Superman, you look like you're at a funeral, and you look like Batman's younger brother. (Revisionism can go only so far without killing - pun intended - the original idea.)", "Historical": "This movie was so epic \ud83d\ude2d i cant control my emotion's man such a beautiful movie just finished watching it this is canon at all cost this is it #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Huge Improvement": "Definitely an improvement to the theatrical Whedon cut. It's too bad we didn't get this version initially as I think it would have been more successful, and we possibly could have gotten some of those planned sequels. Unlikely we ever would have got the 4 hour version, however I think it could have been trimmed down to a 3 hour theatrical version no problem.There were a few scenes I liked more in the Whedon cut, such as the dialogue and interaction between Batman and Superman when they bring him back. Also, when Batman hits a nerve with Wonder Woman. But obviously there was just so much more content in the Snyder one. Steppenwolf and his story is ten times better, especially with the introduction of Darkseid. The Flash and Cyborg backgrounds are way more fleshed out, specifically the latter.I don't like to draw the comparisons between DC and Marvel, but I've always felt like DC should be darker and more gritty than Marvel, and the Snyder Cut holds true to that. It was actually surprisingly gory with a few F bombs being dropped.The main reason this version was so much better was it left me wanting more. I can't say the same for the other. There were lots of set ups for sequels and stand alones, and sadly none of us really know if those will come to pass. The likelihood is probably not. Maybe with HBO Max?When this was first being talked about as a release I wasn't holding my breath. It was for sure better than I thought. It's not perfect by any means, but it's at least what it should have been. Unfortunately this may be a case of too little too late to keep the DCEU afloat.", "ZSJL": "Stunning visuals aided by proper storytelling. Snyder's vision is truly amazing!", "Give me moreeeee": "All I've ever asked for in these superheroes type movies, that were brought over from the comic books.

Autumn this one was for you.", "Good Film Better Soundtrack": "Steppenwolf is greatly improved. I remember watching the original release and thinking what a weak, uninteresting villain. He is so greatly improved here, he's like a new character. All of the characters are improved upon here. Yes, more time helps but so does editing, dialogue, and music. The soundtrack is so damn good, it's almost it's own character. I admittedly have not been a huge fan of the DCEU, but this film really does make you want to see more. To see where Snyder was going with all of this. The idea of the entire Knightmare future being its own film is incredibly exciting. Unfortunately, it looks as though we'll never see it.", "A definite improvement!": "The theatrical version was halfway between average and the worst movie ever made, so a 3/10. This cut is much better, more like a 5-6/10 for entertainment. Most of the dialogue is still cheesy as hell but the movie is now enjoyable.", "Two extra hours would make any turkey into a good movie.": "This is a movie that manages to prove that if you have four hours to tell every aspect that needs telling to make the story work out any mediocre movie can be good. Green Lantern could have been amazing with four hours. Hell. Ishtar could have been at least good of it had four hours for a remake to fix everything people didn't like.So what. Snyder made a good movie with two extra hours and all the reviews of the Whedon and Studio version to go by. Its still four damn hours and a that would never be shown in a theater. Whedon made what the executives wanted. Snyder made what he wanted.", "It's like putting a lipstick on a pig": "The first time this movie was released it sucked. So the director decided to add long and boring scenes that supposed to explain some stuff, added more mediocre CGI and thought it will make the movie better. No, it doesn't. It's the same dull story wrapped with different package. Waste of money and time.", "God lord this movie is over hyped": "Has to be 4 hours to tell a decent story. A super amount of overused slow motion. 4 hours for such a basic plot it's honestly mind blowing. Not to mention having cringe characters jammed in for no reason.", "Wanted to like it": "I really wanted to give it a chance. 4 hours later I regretted it! It was entertaining, like the original. It just was not good!", "Best movie ever": "One of the best movie ever DCEU needs to go in this direction and use this theme they've to be different from marvel and others if they wanna make themselve a name you can't just copy marvel like you tried to do in Whedon's League and Birds of Prey. You've to do your own thing.", "Dreams do come true": "I've waited years to watch my favorite superheroes in a live action film worthy of what DC stands for; Zack Snyder is a passionate, dedicated and visionary film maker which has acomplished something not seen before in the film history and I'm sure fans can agree with me we will always be thankful for giving us such an epic film", "Someone Should Be Fired": "Are you kidding me? This version is about 100 times better than the Saturday morning cartoon we got with Whedon. Snyder made one of the best superhero movies of all time and WB let Whedon completely destroy it. Whoever pulled that crap should be fired and banned from filmmaking. Good grief. The tone, the heart, the action, the pacing, you name it, was so much better. At four hours it was never boring. This is a fantastic movie.", "An almost too big of an all-in from Snyder": "If you liked:\nWatchmen or any of the previous DC Snyder films.Sorry for the long review, but it is a lloong film that took 5 years to make.A bit of backstory first, because some people are still confused as to why this film exists. Zack Snyder is the mastermind behind the DC cinematic universe, like Jon Favreau is for Marvel. He directed Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman and produced Suicide Squad, Aquaman and both of the Wonder Woman films. He is the person who is building the lore and mythology of the DC universe, and virtually the only guy standing in some tangible competition to Marvel. In 2016-17 he directed his Justice League, an ambitious Avengers-like project that was supposed to bring all of the existing DC film characters into one film. Snyder showed his cut to the CEO of the studio which he rejected and so decided to radically shorten and change the film. Right after that - a sudden tragedy: Zack Snyder's 20-year-old daughter, Autumn, committed suicide due to clinical depression. In shock, Snyder left the project entirely and the studio hired Joss Whedon, the director of the first Avengers film. Whedon's film turned out to be a total disaster, he cut so much of the scenes that contributed to character development that both the fans and the critics including myself were immensely disappointed. It smelled cheap, simplistic and unworthy of it's predecessor films and budget, and I personally thought that this was the end of the DC cinematic universe. A crossover as huge as Justice League was most definitely the last film you want to screw up if you cared about your fanbase. But Snyder's fans were unshakable, Warner Bros studio got a storm of criticism from fans who thought the movie failed because Snyder left the project. People started signing petitions, going to flash mobs and started a huge #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag campaign, which became the most tweeted hashtag for an unreleased movie. The word eventually got all the way to the Warner Bros. Executives and the studio gave up - in may 2020 Snyder officially announced that he will be remaking the film.The Snyder cut turned out to be a whopping 4-hour 2 minutes picture and it basically took me 2 weeks to finish because of how critical and suspect I was of the whole endeavor, based on what DC has been producing lately. Most of the footage wasn't new - Snyder just used his filmed material from 2017 that didn't make it into the old cut, but also ended up filming some new, additional scenes that weren't there at all 4 years ago. Snyder tried to go for the impossible, more than half of the film are scenes around character development. The only way you can make 4 hours of superhero drama (as opposed to action) that people will watch is if you have a solid fanbase that deeply cares about the characters, and because it's been 4 years since the flop of the first film, I feel like most fans just stopped caring about DC (I certainly did). This worked for Tony Stark who's been with us since 2008 (11 films total!), and this worked for Steve Rogers who's been here since 2011, this does not work for Superman or Batman that appeared in two films prior to this one. But with this film they also introduced three entirely new characters - Flash, Cyborg and the villain Steppenwolf - and, in my opinion, they saved Justice League. Because these characters appeared for the first time and you basically have no biases or ideas about them from previous films (since almost 90% of their scenes were cut out from the first version), you could take up almost as much time as you wanted to evolve them without being repetitive or boring. Seeing their storylines fully developed we only now realize what a crime editing sometimes can be, their stories are not only personal and interesting, but essential - the soul of the movie.There are certain decisions I disagree with though - first the aspect ratio of 1.33 : 1 (basically a square that fits right in the middle of the screen). I see no reason whatsoever as to why this was necessary or desirable in any way. Yeah sure, you could argue of utility of such ratio for dramatic scenes around character building, make it \"close and personal\". But in the end it is still an epic superhero picture that would have looked much better on the big screen, Nolan big as I call it. Another thing is obviously the length - and I don't really like complaining about that, but 4 hours really is way too long and as you watch it you know exactly what scenes could have been cut from the film completely without making the mistake of the first version and destroying the film entirely (an example would be most of the Lois Lane tangent). I guess after all this history Snyder just decided to leave absolutely everything in, even if some scenes feel like pure time-fillers.But despite these flaws, in the end I did not regret spending 4 hours on a superhero drama. Snyder's Cut gives DC another chance, and DC fans some hope, setting up nicely for future sequels and standalone films like 2022 \"The Flash\".", "Masterpiece From DC": "This One Film Has The Power To Beat The Avengers , Avengers age Of Ultron.", "Joss Whedon should never be allowed to direct again!": "Wow... I mean just wow!!!! Not only is this a completely different version from the original, in every good way, but it has exposed how badly Joss Whedon ruined Snyder's original vision with bad humor, terrible CGI, and overall child friendly atmosphere. Let's hope he sticks to Marvel or directing bad comedy movies from now on.\nSnyder's cut is dark, it's gritty, and it's real! I mean he has literally poured his heart and soul into this movie and it shows. With over 4 hours of footage, there's not a minute where the audience feels bored or like the movie is dragging. This is what fans should've seen years ago! WE NEED SNYDER AT THE HELM OF ALL FUTURE DC PROJECTS!!!!!", "Best Dc Movie": "Loved when the first box opened an the Amazon's ready their weapons to fight..Like the intro's to all the characters especially Cyborg (wow!

This should have been originally released as a 2 part Justice league movie and would have made billions. Just an outstanding movie.", "Yes, it is worst then BvS": "I suppose if you are a fan of this particular filmmaker you may enjoy this.\nHowever if you are a fan American comics or cinema this is one heck of a slug.Of course it has the Zack Snyder remove-all-colours filter on it the entier grueling 4h. It has one of those musical score that you keep ''noticing''. Not sure\nif it wants to be a traditional movie score or some hip-modern electronic beat. As a bonus this painful soundtrack is sparkled with a baffling selection of\nsad-oh-so-very-sad songs that keeps popping up. I suppose since the actual score is so awkward this was the only way to convey emotion with music.\nUnfortunately for the viewer is it safe to say the emotions provoked by this mish mash is certainly not the one the filmmaker was hoping for.As all of M. Snyder movies it is an endless collage of ever-so-epic glory shots made of CGI. The story is basically the same as the theatrical cut.\nBut it is stretched (and I mean STRETCHED). The viewer is left wondering if an editor was actually hired for this. Of course every ''heros'' in this story\nare dark bruiting murderous humorless power fantasies a 10 year old with severe emotional issues might conjure up, so no surprise there.So, if you ever feel the curiosity to know what caused the theatrical cut of Justice League, you too can suffer through this and it will leave you as\nit surely lefts the original producers; thinking this thing can maybe be salvage it we change the entier score, but the colours back in and trim\nit down as much as possible.", "very nice movie, really loved it": "Character development , movie theme is awesome, dark theme , loved story line similar like trying to created like marvel world", "Awesome movie....": "Zack Snyder....like John Boorman....is a master of story telling. This movie absolutely rocks in scope and spectacle the additional scenes added from cyborgs point of you were absolute genius everyone and this movie particularly Ray Fisher simply no bad performances and although the movie clocks in at over four hours you will never ever find yourself bored an awesome spectacle that will rock for the ages", "More likely to get great reviews rather than honest ones.": "I think that the majority of these reviews are from avid fans wanting to prove that these films stand up to their competitors once and for all!The fact of the matter is, unfortunately, there hasn't been an extraordinary film from DC since Christopher Nolan's Batman series.This version of the film however IS 10x better than BvS and Justice League. I'm not saying don't watch it because it is hands down the best film in the team up series, possibly, the stand alone films too!For me the main flaw is the bad guy who's name I won't attempt to spell because I'm not a huge DC fan and have never heard of him. I found him cheesy, pointless, no real motive or depth, and he looked awful. The voice, the CGI and the general concept/styling of the character let down what could've otherwise been a pretty decent rip off of the entire marvel series.Some of the slow motion shots are a little bit too long and flamboyant, but hey, we do all know what to expect from Zach Snyder, let's face it he is a world famous director for a reason even if it is getting a little out of hand now!On the subject of Zach I was really impressed with the character development and back stories in this film, (something I don't think is high on his list when making movies), although the main plot was pretty flat I loved seeing the cyborg in more detail, and FINALLY the Bruce Wayne/ Batman I'd been so excited for all those years ago when Ben Affleck landed the role.The anticipation of this franchise has understandably left us wanting more and a gut full of disappointment. I think most of the reviews on here have been left by hopeful fans not wanting to admit that all the time waiting was for nothing. Personally I think that the new \"The Batman\" film will set the bar high for DC once again and maybe we can have a full house of hero's in the not so distant future. Ultimately it's well worth watching and forming your own opinion, but it's certainly no Nolan. Enjoy!", "I appreciate the original more after watching this": "While it adds a few continuity scenes that would've been nice to include in the original cinema release, which I don't want to go into details on right now, my overall impression of the Snyder cut is that it is rather overblown and a bit pretentious.I am very sad about what happened to his daughter Autumn and if this release brought him closure on that then I am delighted for him and all is justified.Working against that is the disturbingly aggressive movement to get the Snyder cut done and released, which may have put a lot of unnecessary pressure on the director to go overboard in his response, in an effort to meet 'impossible' expectations.Unfortunately, the outcome is a competition between the Wheldon version and the Snyder version and on balance I definitely prefer the former. Sorry Zack - nothing personal. If it's any consolation, I preferred the original cut of Blade Runner too, with its more optimistic ending (that the planet may not end up a wasteland). Unfortunately, the sequel went with the dismal director's version.", "The Kal-El we needed during these times! Snyder is a genius!": "Everything about this was brilliant! The superman we needed. The Barry Allen we adore, the Batman, Wonder Woman and aquaman were just great! Zack Snyder is just brilliant. Don't listen to any negative reviews, sit back and enjoy!", "Awesome film!": "Really enjoyed the film, it has a great story, great action sequences and really did the characters justice.

I knew that wasn't a Snyder film I was hoping for. I never lost hope and look where we are! I was watching the movie with my little brother and we loved it from the beginning till the end. It didn't felt like a 4 hours movie. Every character added beauty in this film. No person was left out. And I still can't believe how good Ray Fisher was. In the Netherlands, we were nervous because we didn't know if we could watch the film on the 18. Thanks God it's possible. This is what the consumer want WB. Let Zack finish his story.

For ordinary viewers the original theater version was slick and nicely paced.Zack Snyder's cut, over 4 hours long, is very similar to the theatrical version, but more detailed with a very much extended different looking ending. Is it better than the theater version?

Truly takes story telling to a whole other realm with the visuals and plot.", "This is the justice league": "It just hit different, you don't even know when 4 hours will be gone.", "The Justice League We Deserves!": "Back in 2017 I saw JL (Joss Whedon) and it was at least good in my opinion it has some entertaining scenes definitely, 8/10. There are a lot of reshoots and a lot of scenes that I personally did not like too like Henry's infamous CGI mouth and the animation for Stepphenwolf though I have no problem with the character design so I pretty much enjoyed myself watching the film but it's just a popcorn flick to me. So when I finally got to see Zack Snyder's Justice League, I was blown away. The movie was that good it fixed all the problems in the previous version and I was impressed with the story it's pretty straightforward and not just a Justice League Extended edition. It's was a different movie indeed. Overall it was worth my time and if they're going release it in 4K blu-ray I'm definitely going to buy the movie.\nCongratulations to Zack Snyder.", "A Solid Superhero Movie": "This is by far a major upgrade from the abysmal predecessor of 2017's Justice League. Zack Snyder's vision was heavenly smothered by Joss Whedon in 2017. Now Snyder has fully been able to show his complete image of his Justice League. The question is, is it good? Yes.There are many positives to this movie: the characters are more well-rounded, the story is cohesive, and the the movie overall holds the viewers attention. Characters like the Flash and most importantly Cyborg are crucial to the story this time around. Instead of Cyborg just spontaneously appearing from the darkness, he has the best arc of the entire film. The Flash as well is actually helping the team instead of pushing cars out of danger, with one of the best visual scenes I've seen in a while.The action, set pieces, and writing are all major step ups.Now there are a few problems with this film. The exposition, even though its needed, at times it is too much. The slow motion, I get is part of Zack Snyder's flavor of film, but it can get overwhelming at times. Then lastly that epilogue is generally unnecessary. It feels as if it could've been limited to at least 15 minutes. Martin Manhunter as well did not need to be part of this as well since I thought he was going to be essential to the final fight, instead of being in just two scenes.Overall, the Snyder Cut is a solid action movie that I highly recommend to DC and comic book fans. The runtime can be worrisome to a causal movie watcher, but you can definitely watch it in intervals. The Snyder Cut is definitely one of the best DCEU films, accompanying now Man of Steel, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman for me. It can be considered a top 15 greatest comic book movie of all time.", "Zack Snyder's fans are crazy": "Turns out Zack hasn't understood why the Justice League is ugly in four years Then I might as well tell him and his fans that the real reason the Justice League sucks is the main line: 1. The main line of Superman's death and resurrection should not be played in the first stage, Zack this decision is a complete failure, seriously blocking the way of the future. Zack's Superman is too strong, after the resurrection of 1V5 is a failure of decision, the others depreciate worthless, you add up to less than a superman, call 666 over. 2. Zack's Darkseid is history's weakest villain, a man who conquers the universe and runs away like a rat after being hacked by the gods of the Earth. Does Darkseid have a mind of its own, shaped by four hours of tie-cutting A powerful villain has to have a \"B\"frame, okay 3. The main world solo isn't finished yet, so why does it have to end with Superman blackening the world It's like trying to run without even learning how to walk. What's the point of Flash's girlfriend showing her face How does a Martian Hunter's presence help the plot I told you to make a movie, not make a music video.", "What a true superhero movie should be": "It was incredible the story the characters and the world building truly a work of art now ready for more #restortheSnydervers", "Like Eating a Whole Cheesecake": "I have to admit that unlike many it seems, I absolutely love the theatrical Whedon version and gave it a 10/10. That's right I'm one of those precious few who feel that way. And I gave this exactly half of that 5/10 for several reasons. Obviously those who didn't care at all for Whedon's version or were merely disappointed might not agree with me.I sat though it once but will never watch it again. It was like eating a whole cheesecake. Don't get me wrong, a slice can be delicious but it would never occur to me that a binge is the way to go and I would have to suffer the consequences.The movie overdoses on itself with a mountain of slow motion shots that can last for minutes at a time. This includes not just action sequences but endless closeups, people walking or reflecting on something as the pace is slowed to a crawl while Snyder indulges in rendering a beautiful image but then staying on it for way too long.There is a reason why a great editor can make or even save a movie. The pacing is all wrong because it is not sustained in a way that I would personally find satisfying. The rendering for Steppenwolf is completely different and I much preferred the one from the original than this new version which looked even more fake. To me he never looked anything else than a cartoon here while in the first version, although not perfect he was adequate enough.The music with choirs and plaintive vocals is very depressing especially in the first few hours before the real action begins. And most of the time it went on for way too long. Some scenes that were snippy and fast in the original with an upbeat tempo were slowed done and stretched to a crawl here with this very sad soundtrack which completely changed the tone of the scene in question.Obviously, Snyder is a genius and can craft beautiful images like nobody's business although I am not a fan at all of the filter he constantly uses which makes everything look drab and brownish. I like vivid colors in movies and this felt grey and darker than I would like.Frankly, the 4:3 ration is the main culprit why I will never see this version again. I don't know why Snyder felt the need to revert back to this archaic format which made every image look cheaper and without scope. The whole way through, I kept thinking about all the background I couldn't see on each side, knowing it existed but was removed on purpose. I just can't understand this decision and I couldn't enjoy it as much as I might have with a proper theatrical format.I wanted to like it cause I love the original so much and there are things that are worth seeing yet I've had my fill and once was enough. I even watched the theatrical cut again the day after I was done as if to rinse it away. And I appreciated it even more. Whedon has a much faster style and I found it a whole lot more entertaining.For those who are big fans of Snyder, I can understand why you would hail this as a great movie especially if you revel in the minutiae and intricate details of this universe with backstories galore. But personally, the 4 hours, the 1:33 format and the non-stop slow motion shots got me so down and depressed that I will never revisit this again.I half recommend so to speak and it is certainly worth a watch but be prepared to live through a very long journey. Let's be clear, this is more a mini-series than a movie and it would probably work better being marketed as such. They decided to release it instead as one of the longest movies ever made.", "The wait was worth": "Loved the story telling, the depth of story and finally a worthy justice league movie", "Snyder the GOAT.": "It's the kind of a movie that deserves to be starved for.\nThe action is so epic and the soundtrack is so great. The best superhero movie I've ever seen so far.", "Just another reminder of what DCEU could/should have been.": "Lets get the obvious question out of the way - Is the new one (ZSJL) better than the old one (JWJL)? YES!\nI didn't have high hopes. I thought I'd leave unimpressed but no, this one is much better than the previous one. The overall plot is the same, but there's a new intro, there's much more to the Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman, Steppenwolf (shoutout to whomever designed this new version of his look) than in JWJL. Darkseid's in it, Supe' wears the black suit, the final showdown is much different, I surely prefer this one. There's a 19 min Epilogue, which is kinda like a set of post credit scenes put together.\nNow that I've gotten the good stuff out of the way, here's the other side -\nDC/DCEU fans are quick point out how this movie is the best ever since it's got so much more. What they conveniently don't mention is that the runtime is TWICE as long! So it BETTER have so much more. JWJL was 2 hours, ZSJL is 4 hrs and 2 mins. I don't know the specifics, but maybe JWJL won't have been as bad if he had 4 hours. People don't mind ZSJL being 4 hrs long because they had a bad experience with JWJL and want to trash it.\nI bet Zack Snyder's 2 hr version won't have been as good as the 4 hr version is, so why compare oranges to apples?\nFrom ZSJL, if you were him, what would you cut to bring this down to 2-2.5 hrs if you HAD to? *crickets* If the ZSJL was the only JL movie we got, I bet you'd have found it to be soooo long. Make up your minds, people! Long movies, or nah?\nWHAT is up with the slo-mo scenes, Zack? MOVE ON! Few too many!\nI personally found the music to be choppy. That switch from some good Hans Zimmer music to bad rock music/great background OST to a 1997 song 'There is a Kingdom' in the very next scene...smh..maybe that's just me.\nLong story short, ZSJL > JWJL. But it's 2x long, and I don't see DC fans and the media accounting for that. At the end of the day, this movie only salvaged the debacle that JWJL was but did nothing to change my opinion on DCEU so far.\nWatch this anyway if you're a movie watcher, regardless of if you're a fan or not, just be honest with your assessment.\nUltimately, this is just another reminder of what DCEU could/should have been. Maybe this can spark something within WB and DCEU makes a turnaround, but I highly doubt it.", "Simply jaw dropping": "Honestly my 4 hours flew by. Its such a good movie. I waited for the movie for 4 years and I believed it exists. Top Notch. Hail Zack Snyder!!!", "Absolutely awesome": "Thanks Zac. This was absolutely amazing. We want more.", "Barely Better": "They basically took the disaster the last movie was and reinforced the rich area so at least some people were saved. The movie is slightly better, which is why I gave this version an extra star, but it's still boring, filled with extra plot holes, wooden acting, terrible writing, and 4 hrs to throw in more useless appearances. WB has luckily reevaluated the whole series and scrapped the Snyder version because after this and BvS, this definitely needed an overhaul. The lack of vision is apparent. Even though this version is better, I'd still recommend that you watch the original cut. The original is funny because it's a train wreck, this version is just boring and trying to pander without any substance, doesn't seem worth adding two extra hours for that. I'm glad DC started caring and making more sense after they dropped Snyder, all because he made 300 doesn't mean he knows how to make a good comic book movie.", "Epic & VISIONARY!": "10/10 might be exaggerated, but it has to be, at least for me, personally. It is grand and full of heart. Better in any aspect, epic fight, most important, this formula to form CBM into cinema is now I concern.", "Burn this movie": "Zack Snyder doesn't have Clue. Movie made no sense and was laughable. Save your 3 hours.", "Great DC movie": "Not in the class of end game but i watched twice way better than the other version i completely forgot the other version.", "A whole new experience": "This is what I call a Justice League movie. It has almost nothing to do with the theatrical release, introducing what it could be the beginning of a series of movies, exactly like the Infinity War saga for Marvel. I really hope the sequels get released! We have some cut scenes from theatrical release, but a whole lot of new backstories and new scenes and of course a different villain. It's around 4 hours long so be prepared!", "Can't watch it beyond first 30 mins :(": "I have not watched 2017 version, but this is unwatchable for me, the movie is kind of stupid, very unrealistic, dialogs and actors play are boringWhen watching it I mostly compare with Marvel, and it's nowhere near it.", "Well Done Zack Snyder!": "I was skeptical about watching this film. Mainly due to the long runtime and as I was not a fan of the 2017 Justice League. It was worth the watch the additional content really makes the film feel whole. Cyborg and Flash get fleshed out they actually feel like characters. The wonder woman fight scenes looked really bad ass in the film. Ben Affleck's batman is really starting to really grow on me. Not much, but the extra violence added to the film helped. In making the characters feel much tougher. I hope this gets a sequel as it has many stories to be told.", "Disappointed Expectations after masterpiece BvS": "To be honest i like Joss Whedon's JL more. It's more complex, less pretentious(it is fine when it's reasonable), with humor and fitting characters. Snyder's Cut just has too much cliche and unreasonable pathos, stupid dialogues, bad work with characters. However, the picture itself 3 or 4 heads over Whedon's JL, nearly every frame looks beautifully. Although i dislike how Martian Hunter, Stephen Wolf and Darkside look, i mean, it could be much better.", "Director Edition is Better": "Overall, I like it very much. It has its own characteristics, but it would be better if it could be darker. The characterization of each hero is very good, and the transition logic is also good. I haven't seen the big screen version. This version is enough for four hours It's meticulous and well laid out, but it's really a little tired after reading it, but overall it's not bad. I really like Wonder Woman. The Wonder Woman in it is even more sexy and charming than in her own movies... Hope Warner has a sequel to it.", "This is not the improvement over the Justice League 2017": "Yes, you read it write. This movie is not an improvement over the previous Justice League released in 2017. This is a whole another movie. Whether you are a DC fan or not, you got to erase the Justice League 2017 from your memory.\nJustice League was Snyder's vision and he did justice to it. This movie is just better in every aspect, whether it is graphics or music or storytelling. Whedon and DC should understand this very clearly that DC universe is nothing like Marvel Universe. I like Marvel movies which are action comedies. But I don't want this for DC.\nJust a small request to DC - Believe in Snyder's vision.", "Superior to \"Josstice\" League (2017) But Not That Great.": "Frankly, Zack Snyder's Justice League was superior to Justice League (2017) - it lived up to the hype, it made the anew and it was a true continuation of Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. But honestly, part of me feels the movie is not that great.First of Zack Snyder's Justice League is just too long. Like four hours of movie to watch is just too long. And it was filler with irrelevant story arcs, more plot holes, and way too much slow motion. It took me two days to complete the movie cos I was always falling asleep midway.Secondly, although adding more scenes to make the movie more understandable and adding more depth to the characters, the Snyder's Cut still cut out and eliminated many of my favorite scenes like Wonder Woman's opposition to Superman's resurrection, Diana's and Bruce Wayne near altercation and Batman masterminding Lois Lane's calming down of Superman.Other than these, Zack Snyder's Justice League was good. Its action scenes, the Cyborg storyline, and its Injustice-related themes. But great? It just wasn't.", "disappointment": "Clearly this version is not what I could call the best. Some shots are much too long, complete backstory is missing, like that of cyborg, summarized in 10 minutes when clearly there is enough to make a film and the chronology has taken a stray bullet. I would even say a cannonball. What's going on between Mera and Aquaman? (Already she disgusts me but that's not directly related to the film so we'll pass) But we agree they are supposed to have at least a minimum of relationship following the film Aquaman. Not necessarily lovers but at least friends? Seriously the only exchange they had in two hours of film, it's a stupid Backstory on the mother of Aquaman that he has already found and what is more, he blames her for leaving when he is supposed to know the reasons!? What is this untie! And worst of all, Flash, I'm sorry the only Barry Allen worth going to the movies for is Grant Gustin. Because in addition to being ridiculous when he runs, Ezra Miller is not a professional (in his work as an actor). The DC universe is a disappointment from start to finish.", "Best comic book movie of all time!": "The Snyder Cut is honestly the best comic book movie I've ever seen/enjoyed and I couldn't take my eyes from the the screen if I could give it more than a 10 I would.", "Almost perfect!": "So I never read comics as a kid, so I don't pretend to know anything about anything when it comes down to it. With that said, Josstice League was an absolute dumpster fire. I remember watching JL and the movie, and there was 0 character development. That was because the length of the movie was only supposed to be 2 hours, so obviously that's not enough time to develop this huge cast. ZSJL on the other hand, amazing character development. Only reason it got 9/10 stars was because there were maybe approximately 3 times during the movie vfx looked bad, it wasn't awful, but it was cringe. Great job Zach!", "DC Masterpiece!! Zack Snyder's Justice League is a Triumph": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is truly an cinematic EPIC. It's DC's Lord of the Rings. Simple as that. I'm truly blown away Zack. This movie is VERY Heroic!! For the first time in a long time I welled up with so much emotions, as a diehard DC fan seeing our universe mythology just come to life in such a massive 4 hour film was an experience only Zack could accomplish. He truly understands our universe and characters and deconstructs them like no one ever has. He knows our comic mythology is at an EPIC level!! This film just opened up this world even BIGGER!!! Get ready to witness the first Justice League restored back to its FULL GLORY!! Also the MUSIC is phenomenal. Wonder Woman new theme and the justice league theme is forever engrained in my brain for the rest of time. This WILL continue because audiences are gonna demand it after THAT ending \ud83d\ude0e #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "this need to be canon": "This is the justice league movie we deserve ,snyder should finish his story without wb messing in his way", "we did it! we did it! we did it!": "A great time to be a comic fan! congrats to all the people who went out to get zack's vision came true.", "Finally a good movie (much better than the previous one)": "Not sure why critics are being really bad, I had to watch this movie over two sessions but still worth it!", "Perfectly Balanced !": "Snyder's Cut is a worth watch and it's fulfill the audience desires about what people truly want in this movie. Every character has introduced with back storyline and depth. Specially the background score is too good to hear while watching the movie. VFX is at the top of it's peak and it's far better than the 2017s Justice League. There's a lot more we see as we have seen in the 2017e movie.I'm glad that I get the experience to watch Snyder's Cut finally....", "Many of the High reviews are from DC Hard Fans": "Well I watch the movie.\nFor those who have not watch the first version, you are capable of getting crazy with the film. Live like you've never lived before.\nNow for those who have watch the first version of the film, it is good to see a development of all the characters in due time and the improvement of the action and CGI scenes, but the film is very long, it becomes a little tedious for the viewer and the line of the plot has the same poor circuit of the Joss Whedon one. And I was disappointed to see only 5 minutes of the Joker, with so much publicity around him.", "Epic film I wish it continues": "This was something like a superhero film with abit of the epicness of lord of the rings..it is difficult to describe it. I truly hope they continue this, it has enormous potentials. Visually stunning with great pace and character development.", "Great special effect, what should be in Hollywood": "The storyline is build up for a sequel, with a 4H length movie, would expect more. You are not getting bored through the hours of watching but most moments are slow. Like that they give a small introduction to each character making new incomers like girlfriends a better intorduction to cartoon movies. The plot is getting chewed out so easily so it is easily know where it is leading to. What was before difficulty was later an easy peasy, what is so strange.Great work but I hate so much the sequel build up of the story telling making it dislike for these movies instead finishing with a bang and see how the audience is reacting and later on make a follow-up on it and make it better.There are no surprise elements, everything is predictable. The story goes 2/6 introduction of the characters, 3/6 development of the plot, 1/6 to finish it up.", "Very good": "Im gonna be honest, i dont remember anything from justice leage 2017 movie. Probably cause it was not a good movie for me, but i think i will remember this one for sure. Cgi is not the best, but budget is only 70 mil. for a 4 hours movie, i get it why cgi is bad. But im okay with that, story for this was amazing and action was good too. 4 hour movie, but i was not bored at all. I hope for more Snyder cut 3-4 hours long movies to be released on steaming platforms. Atleast something cool to watch, cause cinemas are closed because of covid.", "Very long and filled with unnecessary scenes": "This movie is 4 hr long. Most of the movie can be completed in 3 hr. Now I don't mind getting more story, but we don't get more story for an extra hour. Instead we get really really pointless scenes like\n1. Martian Manhunter introduction. He didn't help when Zod attacked the world and was literally terraforming the earth or when Doomsday killed Superman. But he comes back to get Lois back on her feet. Again he doesn't help the heroes fighting Steppenwolf but later shows up. Entire scenes should be cut.\n2. Epilogue nightmare scene. No need for this at all. Who even understands what is going on in these movies? Only die nerd hard fans can understand this. Cut this out.Another thing is a lot of scenes drag on, especially in act 3/4.From act 5 to the end, everywhere the soundtrack is too loud to appreciate any fighting scene. Its like horn blower ringing near our ear.With all these negatives, there were some good things as well.\nAny shot Darkseid was part of was amazing. Even Steppenwolf was great.\nAmazon Island attack scene was really well done.\nEntire Cyborg family aspect was amazing, and Cyborg as a human were much needed scenes.\nFinally everything Wonder Woman did was amazing. But the constant 300 like noise and slow motion shot of Wonder Woman became ridiculous by third hour.Superman was ok. No change between 2017 and this movie.\nBatman was ok.\nFlash was much better but his powers are not at all explained. Only nerd fans will understand his scenes. This is not good for a movie.Overall, a little better than 2017 version but DC blew it from beginning.Killing Superman in DC's just 2nd movie - Wrong\nBringing Justice League with no setup - Wrong\nBringing Darkseid story so early - Wrong\nMaking flash reverse time so early - WrongThere have been so many things already wrong that this universe is doomed.", "Way too much filler and way too much CGI.": "A hot mess. There is so much unnecessary filler that is absolutely pointless. It's like 90% CGI. It was like watching a video game and the casting is terrible for all roles. So bad. However, Steppenwolf is much scarier in this version and if you're gonna watch one, this is the one to watch.", "What a pleasant surprise.": "I came in having zero expectations. The countless reviews were all over the place. People loved it, hated it, and everything in between. And apparently some of the Snyder haters AND fanboys \"bot-stormed\" Letterboxd creating accounts just to add a 1/2 or 5 stars.Thankfully starting where BvS left off (vs. the infamous CGI-stached Superman), almost EVERYTHING is different.One of the first action scenes with Wonder Woman is just a great example of the differences between the two movies.ANATOMY OF A SCENE: WONDER WOMAN\nIn both movies, Wonder Woman intercepts a luddite terrorist group planning to blow up a museum. I don't think there were any re-shoots in this scene so it's a great example of how the editing and score are exponentially improved by Snyder. The scene begins as a bunch of these suited terrorists storm the museum. In the original, that setup is brutally cut short while the Snyder cut is similar to the tension building opening of The Dark Knight. The actual Wonder Woman scene goes from about one minute to three minutes in the new cut, from a sneeze-and-you miss-it of mediocre action into one of the most badass Wonder Woman action scenes in all of her movies combined. Every shot is paced meticulously (things are slowed down AND sped up seamlessly), all to a fantastic score, and with the cuffs off with no PG-13 rating, it was just fabulously brutal and visceral.The movies extra time doesn't feel like filler. It's used effectively for building critical character arcs and establishing the important narrative of the threat of Stephenwolf and Darkseid.And what a massive improvement to the CGI and the special effects. I it was difficult to enjoy most of the Whedon cut due to the utterly distracting and horrible CGI. As an example, in the theatrical version, you couldn't look at Steppenwolf without cringing at his mouth movement. In the Snyder cut, that's fixed and his shimmering spiked suit is fairly interesting to look at it.Unfortunately, not everything is fixed, especially Ezra Miller's Flash. His introductory scene which is new is unfortunately muddled and oddly uncomfortable.ANATOMY OF A SCENE: FLASH (minor spoilers)\nBarry Allen is introduced while walking into a store where he bumps into Kiersey Clemons' Iris West (future love interest clearly). They googly eye each other for what feels like five minutes, but her gaze at him is just ... weird. Love at first sight? Then Ezra Miller's manically speed-talks for an interview and then there's that scene from the trailer where he saves her from her car crashing into a truck. But before he saves her, they give each other more googly eyes in super-slow-mo but this time her stare is corpse-like. And then he lovingly caresses a monster weiner of a hot-dog (no bun) that is floating in front of her face and then -- puts it in his pocket.I have so much more to say about the movies:The pluses: how vastly improved the soundtrack and score is, the wonderful scenes in Atlantis, Cyborg's critical extra time on screen, etc.\nThe minuses: the bloated finale, the multiple endings, the aspect ratio, etc.But I need to close this review out because I feel like I could just write endlessly -- and I am not that great of a long-form reviewer.AFTERWORD:\nI am very happy for Zack Snyder. To have that horrible tragedy happen and then have his movie essentially destroyed and pilloried, then to have that most rare opportunity to reintroduce what he originally intended, without studio interference. I feel like this is the justice (no pun intended) he deserved.", "I thought it was a new film!": "I admit when I saw the trailers, I got excited that a new movie is coming out. I didn't realize it was the 2017 one re-made longer. But about 30 minutes into the movie, I was like I had seen this one before, what's going on.\nI think Hollywood is in big trouble if they redo a movie after 3 years.\nIt's 4 hours long, I watched it on a lesser-known website, so I thought maybe it's leaked before the final cut. I mean 4 hours?!\nThe soundtrack is so out of the place.\nSome scenes does not make any sense.\nThe slow-mo scenes are kinda annoying too.\nThe villains are not scary at all. What about showing more of their backstory too? I still don't understand what they were on about.\nI watched it in three sittings, it was alright like a mini series. It is not bad, but definitely not a 10 for me.", "It is okay": "Didn't see the original version, so can't compare.I thought this was going to be impossibly boring because of the absurd run time but it managed to maintain my interest for the full film. Nothing really stands out, the imagery and action are fine but unimaginative\nand overall there is nothing to be amazed by. Probably wouldn't make good background noise.Very functional middle film but I haven't watched the prequel and the sequel isn't out so I can't say if it works for the whole series.", "Truely masterpiece": "This is how one should make superhero movies... if story is masterpiece then even 4 hours doesn't matter at all.", "Glad He Was Able to Put His Vision Out There!": "If you don't know that story, back in 2017, there was a movie that wasn't that good. It was called Justice League. The original director (Zack Snyder) who was supposed to be behind it had a family crisis that he had to get too and while he was gone, Joss Whedon stepped in to \"fix the film.\" So he did that and we got the film we got. People started campaigning to get Zack Snyder's Justice League. Just over a year ago, Warner Bros said they will put it on their streaming platform. Now it is out. Zack Snyder's Justice League is about Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) coming down to Earth to gather these things called Motherboxes that will let the evil villain, Darksied (Ray Porter) come down to Earth and take it for himself. The Justice League find this out and will not let Steppenwolf accomplish his goal. This movie has one of the best stories I have ever seen in a superhero movie. It tops all Marvel movie stories. I think Marvel sort of screwed DC over. They had all of their light comedy action movies that just happened to have Spiderman and Iron Man in it and when DC started making their universe, people were expecting a light hearted action movie. Although Zack Snyder wanted to do a dark take on the Justice League and all of the heroes he wanted. DC has even been doing this for years with movies like Batman Returns, The Dark Knight, Constantine, and many more. It isn't a new concept at all. Just now people want comedy in action. Marvel set a standard that people want all superhero movies to be like and in the process screwed over many other superhero series or franchises like DC, The Unbreakable series, Hellboy, and more. The superhero genre used to not be all over the place. DC comes out with two films a year that is it. This year Marvel has four plus three tv shows. That is way too much. This movie did its own thing. I respect that. It was a pretty dark movie. He took his time in the movie to get to the climax and it payed off because you ended up really caring for all of the characters involved in the film. It was brilliant writing. I thought someone was lost in the process though. Aquaman didn't really have that much motivation to help save the world. He did have one small thing but he still didn't have that much motivation to do what he ended up doing. I think most people ended up overlooking it because he needed up getting his own movie that explained a lot of his backstory although in this movie, we didn't really get much of that. Overall though, the story was a strong side of the movie. The acting was by-far the best part of the movie. Ben Affleck gave a way better performance. In the other you could tell he didn't want to be there at all. Ray Fisher also was given more of a light to shine in in this film. He was given way more space to show off how good of an actor he is. Same thing for Ezra Miller. Gal Gadot did the same as she did in the first one and same for Henry Cavill. Jason Momoa also did the exact same in this film as in the first one. The CGI was pretty good for most of it being done without the technology that they would normally use. There were some scenes that could use a little touching up but I came into the movie thinking the CGI wasn't going to be a strong suit. Although, it wasn't anything that would take you out of the movie. The score was a major improvement from the first movie. Junkie XL came back and did the score for this film. I am not saying that Danny Elfman's score was bad but I liked the new take on the music that Junkie XL has been doing as well. He did this really amazing thing with vocals for the Amazonian theme. The score ended up being another improvement for the film. Zack Snyder's Justice League improved the story, color grading, and acting from the 2017 Justice League. I would watch this film over that one by a land slide. I would recommend this film to anybody who likes superhero movies and just anybody who wants to watch a good movie!", "Masterpiece Movie Ever": "I really Appreciate it. One of the best Movie Ever.\nI will Thank Mr Zack Snyder.\nThank you so much for us such a greatest movie \ud83c\udf7f", "Snyder is back!

I am disappointed we have lost Ben Affleck as batman after watching this.", "What an epic film!": "Ever since the release of the theatrical version, I had prayed constantly that Zack Snyder's version of the film existed and what was rumored in the media would make it better than what Joss Whedon did. Now that it has been officially released, it exceeded my expectations and delivered some nice surprises. The character development was more fleshed out in this one from Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batman, Superman, and Flash. Ray Fisher stole the show as Cyborg. Steppenwolfe had a more in-depth storyline and his new design was badass. This is not just a movie. This is an experience. A hat tip to Mr. Zack Snyder for this epic thrill ride and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the DCEU.", "AAA PLUS MOVIE": "R.I.P AUTUMN! RESPECT ZACK! WE LOVE YOU! FROM TURKEY!", "Better, but still with problems..": "I'm rating this 8/10 rather than 7/10 because of the movie's problems which, im sure, are down to Warner Bros and not the brilliant people behind making this film.This is a far greater adaptation in comparison to Joss Whedon's (or Warner Bros') version of it. Why? Steppenwulf is more captivating, his CGI looks way better, he has more interesting motives. Darkseid is awesome in this, we don't get to see him much but his design, voice, and menacing presence is similar to Thanos' in the earlier Marvel Movies. They utilise The Flash and Cyborg better in this because they have more backstory.Now, down to the negatives: lets not kid ourselves here, if this was split between two movies separated by a year. We'd all be disappointed. Its the Netflix paradime at play, where TV shows seem better than they are because you can binge-watch it and ignore the filler in the process. There is tonne of filler in this film.\nWe also must understand, that Justice League is still a rushed project. Even Zack Snyder's cut has this feeling where they all just meet and a few scenes later they've formed the Justice League. Its uninteresting and uncaptivating.The ending: Awesome, this opens the door completely for future DC films. The conversation between The Joker and Batman is what we want to see more of, great dialogue.", "Need to more sequel": "Knightmare scene made me looking forward to sequel.And this movie?

The studio must be full of idiots that don't actually like superhero movies. First rendition was awful, it's like the studio wants to keep making bad movies.Great movie, remarkably similar to recent DC animated films, which until this one, were the only decent DC movies since TDK.", "Bloated Snyder Cut Is Interesting But Not Good": "We have finally gotten the \"what could have been\" Snyder Cut and the results are... interesting. It is true that it is both the same as the 2017 film as well as being different. Some of these differences are more obvious than others. Such as; it's twice the length of the 2017 film. So there's quite a bit here we haven't seen before. For example, both Steppenwolf and Cyborg are more fleshed out this time around. There's also no creepy mustaches-less CGI or unnecessary Russians gumming up the works.Those obvious differences aside, there's plenty of similarities. For example, The Flash is still the comedic relief, spouting out even more one liners than he did in the 2017 version. That's probably the most surprising thing about the Snyder Cut; the amount of humor that is in it. So it should be pointed out that despite what many people have claimed over the years, it is quite evident that a majority of the 2017 film was indeed directed by Zack Snyder. It's just that certain scenes were sometimes made shorter and/or shown in a different order, but in the grand scheme of things, very few scenes didn't carry over.The Snyder Cut, however, does share a similar flaw that hampered \"Batman v Superman\". The pacing is a bit stop and go and that's really due to the fact that it needs to cover too much ground. There's far too much character and story exposition required here because they didn't properly set it up in previous films. If nothing else, Snyder's Cut proves that this universe really needed a few standalone movies before it even existed in the first place. One of my biggest gripes, however, is with the choice of songs. None of them really worked for me. In fact, they were almost unintentionally funny. That Barry/Iris slo-mo sequence, in particular, is dreadful. That all said, It's not all bad. There is actually something to enjoy here, it's just not enough to hail it as anything more than a failed experiment.So for better or worse, this is Snyder's vision and for some, that's more important than the actual quality itself. But at the end of the day, no matter how bad it is, it's always interesting to have to watch to opposing cuts of the same film.", "Just amazing. A cinematic pleasure!": "By far the best movie by Snyder. I absolutely loved every part of this 4-hour experience. This movie has nothing to do with the theatrical cut as this new version is 1000 times better in every aspect. I hope WB restores the Snyder-Verse.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League 2021 Review": "\"Evil does not sleep, it waits.\"I am very happy to say this exceeded my high expectations going in to this. This is leaps and bounds better than the original 2017 Joss Whedon cut. This version adds a ton, cleans it up, and presents it in such a beautiful way. This is the true way to watch The Justice League.Let me start with some positives:\nA deeper remorse for the loss of Superman.Amazing new character development for all of the characters including some we absolutely needed like for Steppenwolf, Cyborg, and The Flash.Action is tense, impactful, full of risk, and has a sense of urgency.Steppenwolf looks incredible and I was awe-struck by his new, spikey, iridescent armor.A reveal that will shock most.The 4:3 aspect ratio (that I was initially worried about) fits this film perfectly and I personally had no problem with it.No more weird saturation / color filters that were extremely distracting and ugly in the original.The Batman \"dream sequence\", that was horrendous in the original, fits in the film a lot better and actually means something for the future of the DCEU.Jared Letos 'Joker' feels improved, though we don't get a lot, makes me hope someday he gets that chance again to prove himself.No \"we live in a society\" lineThe fact that it's chopped into 6 chapters will make this wildly more accessible for normal watchers to get through the 4 hour runtime.Lastly, the 4 hour runtime, although long, is very well used and makes this film feel a lot more structured when compared to the original. It even flows well through all six chapters and makes a coherent film unlike the original.The few negatives I have:\nYou'll definitely have to plan when and how to watch this because of its runtime.A few scenes where the acting / CGi wasn't the best, but it never took me out of the experience.Jared Leto deserved more screen time, I hope he gets another chance with his own film.This film really blew me away. I'm not really a big DC fan in general, and definitely not a fan of the DCEU as it stands. But that being said, this has opened my eyes and makes me want to see more from Zack Snyder particularly with the DCEU. This is by far my favorite film in the DCEU currently ... The action was amazing, especially that final fight with Steppenwolf, dare I say, was some of my favorite superhero team-up action i've seen. Everything from the action to the character development, the score to the visuals, it all feels worth it. I'm extremely impressed with this film and how far its come from that terrible 2017 cut. Claps all around for Zack Snyder.", "OMG! They fixed it !": "This is the way (wrong franchise but yeah!)\nWent into sleep or tantrums on previous bs.\nThis is the real thing!

And because of such we have the opportunity to experience Zack Snyder's Justice League. A reality in which Joss Wedon's abomination has been undone as if by the grace of \"The Unity\"!Wow! Like really... Wow! And the best part of it all... that absurd running minor sub-plot of the Slavic family caught behind enemy lines in the Chernobyl like HQ of Steppenwolf. God bless Zack Snyder for eradicating that pointless Macguffin! OMG Iwanted to tear my head off when I saw, ie was tortured, the original version!One critique though... Next time ease up on the over use of the slow motion camera effect... ehhhh a tad much...Ohhhh and yes I was always bothered that the Flash in the dream sequence had a Speedy Gonzalez like look in the Dawn of Justice Brice Wayne alternate universe flash forward. That drive me nuts causing me to question if there had bern a recasting I never caught.

I rewatch Batman v Superman before watching this and while not necessary, it did give me a background info refresher.\nIt's hard to put in writing what specifically makes this version so much better, but for me it basically boils down to a better, clearer story. Everything made sense in this version! Nothing felt like it was skipped over. And also I felt like characters like Cyborg, the Flash and Aquaman got a MUCH more fair showing this time.\nWhat really made this over the top for me was the Epilogue. SO MANY DIRECTIONS TO TAKE THE NEXT MOVIES!!! And that's what do exciting- this version can def breathe new life in to DC\nMy only complaint was the overuse of slow motion. Some scenes (like for Flash) totally get it, even a few seconds here and there for everyone- but sometimes it just went on too long\nAll in all, a must see for DC fans!", "RELEASE THE SNYDER-VERSE": "Was one of the best movies I ever watched, worth the wait and the 4 hour length", "Pleasently surprised": "I really did not care for the first justice league movie a couple of years ago.

Cgi was better (although not on the level of the avengers (if a comparisation has to be made), it has a darker vibe and feels more serious.\nWhat I did not like:\nBen Affleck just is not a really good Batman in my opinion. He's a bit flat throughout the movie.a bit too much slow motion. After a while you just don't care anymore about the added value a good executed slow motion brings to a scene.steppenwolve's voice is really not in sync with his moving lips. That's really annoying and I don't get why. Does not seem that hard. Same goes for Desaad and the other villains.if you use cgi because reshooting was not possible, than just avoid the inclusion of such a scene. Ben affleck was obviously fake in the scene in his cabin in the woods in the epilogue, when talking to the Martian. Awful.There are some other scenes where you can obviously spot that it's fake. That's a pity in this era.I think this movie is a clear upgrade from the first. I would recommand it to others, even if you really disliked the first version. This one is without a doubt better.\nThe only thing I would have cut from the movie is the epilogue chapter. Did not care for that. Has no added value since there will be no sequel.To end, could someone explain to me why aquaman always feels the need to take off his shirt before jumping into the water?

But ill try to be short and on point (since my english is GREAT.....)\nFirst of all i thought the movie was a bit too long. As a fan of LOTR extended i usually dont have a prob watching a long movie, but when Snyders constant slow-mo shots takes up most of the scenes, i start to loose my interest.\nDont get me wrong - the movie tries (and succeeds sometimes) to be epic, but it falls short unfortunately.\nWhat this movie succeeds most in is character development! Even Steppenwolf gets motivation in this film, but he also falls a bit short with his overpoweredness. Just another big guy who gets hit alot, but doesnt seem to get hurt except when the movie tells him to be hurt.\nThen to the CGI - And again, this movie is a MASTERPIECE compared to the first one - but i noticed a bunch of weird animations and i even got an example. Watch when Silas Stone (cyborgs father) gets dragged by the arc demons to Steppenwolf for interrogation. For some reason his legs go completly wild.. And when the queen of the Amazons starts sliding under the last barricade her feet doesnt even seem to be somewhat close to touching the ground. But now im nit-picking..I give this 6/10 not only because im really strict in rating movies, but i see 7 as a fun movie that i\u00b4d love to watch again, but not a fantastic movie like 8-10.

So so SO many changes were made. Why?The ending was again confusing. I think that Zack snyder just isn't good in hinting plots for the future, with him it comes across as confusing, and if you don't know that this is his style, you will think it 'stupid'. Now that I've seen this version and rewatched the rest, there is some logic in this chaos. But still, I don't like this/his style of story telling. In any case this movie was far better and consistent.

There's nonsensical disappearances of key characters in plot moving scenes, and wardrobe changes so quick, the editors didn't even notice them happening. I could easily continue ranting about all thats wrong with this film, but quite frankly, I think I've dedicated more than enough time to this thing today. Warner Bros. Needs to stop making live action DC movies. They aren't any good at it. Stick to the animated movies, majority of time, they are top shelf. They'll NEVER catch up to the MCU, they lack the vision.

The Snyder Cut is a huge improvement from Josstice League (2017), which was one of the worst superhero movies I'd ever seen. The Snyder Cut actually had character development and a good villain, unlike Joss Whedon's version. Snyder's version was also way less cringe and had much better color grading, because for some reason in Josstice League the final battle had a weird orange hue. I did have a couple issues with the Snyder Cut, mainly the fact that it is way too long: with a runtime of 4 hours and 2 minutes. There are so many slow motion shots in this movie-which I get is Snyder's thing-but without all that slow-mo I'm sure the movie would be cut down by like half an hour. There were also some unnecessary scenes, like the scene with Iris and the scenes with Lois and Martha. Those could've been cut out and the movie could've been three hours, which is still long but a lot more bearable. I also did not like the epilogue, because it set up so many movies that are probably never gonna happen. Leto's Joker was cool though and way better than his Joker in Suicide Squad. I think the main reason I really liked this movie is because of how much better it is than Josstice League, because I watched this with a few friends and the one friend who hadn't seen Justice League did not like Snyder's version. Which is interesting. But we all agreed that the final battle was amazing, and although I don't know much about DC, I do know that that battle is the right way to do the Justice League. I give Zack Snyder's Justice League an 8/10 overall. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but... #restorethesnyderverse.", "GOAT": "One of the best CB movie ever..

We also get a more in-depth look at Cyborgs struggles with his father.\nOne thing this movie does perfectly is depicting truly tense situations, when terrorists brake into the London bank, take hostages(some children), and start a countdown that will blow up 4 city blocks, we see a small moment of silence as the terrorist takes aim at the children, we see the emotion in his eyes as he switches his rifle to full auto; then the silence is interrupted by the booming soundtrack that accompanies wonder women as she deflects an entire magazine of bullets aimed at the hostages.\nThe only reason I'm giving this movie 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because at times, the cgi is lacking.

This all star ensemble cast, which include Superman (Henry Cavill), unite an alliance to battle demons from other worlds, Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) and his Parademon soldiers. Led by orders of Darkseid (Ray Porter) Steppenwolf comes to earth to find an ancient technology known as Mother Boxes (change machines) in order to \"cleanse\" earth.

I thought Man of Steel was quite good, somewhat enjoyed BvS, and liked Aquaman, but I just couldn't get into the 2017 version of Justice League. It was so forgettable to me that I fell asleep...and I didn't even go back to the missed part. But the Snyder Cut...I must say...Bravo! I liked the somewhat darker tone but it wasn't too over the top. Everything is subjective, but I think it would be a BIG mistake to not involve Zack Snyder in the DCU in the future, especially after the disastrous (IMO) WW84. Cyborg is AMAZING in the Snyder Cut. I even started to like this incarnation of The Flash...which bummed me out before because I wasn't sure I was buying it before. Even Jared Leto was BETTER than I remember. So, from the Marvel side, I wish the DCU a bright future! We need a good DCU.", "Love it": "Best thing I have seen from DC since Flashpoint Paradox and Superman Red son.", "It NEEDS to continue": "I was very anxious about watching this movie incase it was a massive let down. However, this completely knocked it out of the park. The story was grounded and entwined and made the 4 hour experience fly by.

The first cut was too short and had no story to it and felt rushed. The character development was insane and the story had life to it and was understable and Steppenwolf looked like a proper villain instead of an 80s cartoon character. Anyone who hates on this film has nothing better to do with their life because it was 10/10", "It's Huge": "Every character has played his or her role very precisely,", "Painful Ending...": "Knowing there will be no Justice League 2, 3. The Snyder cut set up an amazing story arc for part 2 and 3. As a hardcore DC fan, this will be one of those painful moments when you realize how we have been back stabbed by DCU and WB. I just dont understand how they can give up on such a mega opportunity to cash in and build a better universe. I wont be watching any of the upcoming movies simply because I regard this as the \"End\" just like they claim it to be.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is absolute blast!": "There are just so many things that this movie gets right over its counterpart. This actually feels like it belongs in the same world as Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and picks up exactly where the previous left off. The characters are given more time to shine and all have significant time to show they help the group. The Flash however steals the show in the 3rd act of the movie and there is so much more story to tell beyond this one movie. The rewatch ability is at a all time high and would love to see where the story goes from here.", "Quality Justice League": "I watched the lot, and I'm going to watch it many more times, absolutely brilliant movie 10/10", "A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT & WASTED TIME": "I can only imagine how bad the original Justice League was (not going to watch it to find out) if this was the \"improvement.\"A 2 hour movie stretched to 4 hours.Dull, boring, looked like a TV show at times, way overlong, had to force myself to watch it to the end.Marvel has nothing to worry about.", "This IS THE JL we deserved!": "Mr.Zack Snyder - you have given us the best and only true vision of JL!!! We need you to save The DC Universe we need the Snyderverse to exist !!! Every moment of this movie made me proud to be a DC fan unlike the vast majority of the DC/WB garbage that is being produced. The property is going downhill fast and Zack Snyder is the man we need to continue the stories that we all know and love . Long Live ZS Justice League - Long Live Zack Snyder!#RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Ohhh , ho ho ho whoa ho ho WHOA, what in the $#@! did I just watch?!?!?": "I really did not know what to expect before seeing this film. There were no commercials for it and the only reason I knew it existed at all was because of the plethora of late nite talk shows. Best I can understand it without looking it up is this film is a compilation of older (recent) movies chopped together in order to fulfill a vision of how that story was meant to be told. Now, what can I say? It's a NON - stop \"Meth\" fueled unrelenting journey. This is not your usual boring yadda yadda yadda- Ooooh really ? That's interesting----I DONT CARE type film. You will NOT have to suffer through endless dialogue in order to get to the good stuff. The good stuff arrived immediately AND DOES NOT LET UP- for 4 hours. I say this is a mish-mash of older films but you will not know it. As far as I can tell most if not all scenes are new. The beginning had a few familiar scenes ( I think) but besides that - glorious newness.It's a \"dark\" film, not in the sense of \"ohhh the humanity\" - just cinematography wise. There are not a whole lot of fresh flowers and sunny days happening here.. Which totally works - but maybe not for 4 hours 20 minutes of it. We are humans after all. Dirty filthy humans - we need that flower here and there to balance things out.Something i like a lot is that instead of the jabber jabber yammer of dialogue, the director opted for silent scenes, usually focusing on one \"frame\" so to speak - that tells a story in and of itself. A very powerful way to execute it in my opinion.Okay, now ALL that being said, it's NON- STOP- I mean REALLY NON- STOP. I thought that was super awesome in the beginning but hour after hour - one then hour 2 and then 3 yadda yadda yadda . I have come to the conclusion for the 1st time in my life that too much is sometimes too much and not a good thing. It's tiring, this film is very tiring. An AWESOME film, no doubt. But I am exhausted after watching this (and that's with it being watched over 2 nights). Sometimes, there truly is too much of a good thing.", "Good, not great.": "I liked it very much, some parts more than others.Amber Heard's portrayal of a manipulative man-hating psychopath is spot on and very believable.Ezra as the flash is a real golden nugget also.", "Sequel please": "Paving the way for a new run time format.

There's no doubt that this is the movie we were waiting for since 2017.", "Bloody, gritty, violent, exciting, FREAKING R Rated!": "It feels like such a nice change of pace and I love that. It felt more grounded - The movie knew when it needed to be serious, when we needed a joke and when the characters just needed to interact with one another, for us a viewers, and the Justice League as a team to care and get to know each other.\nOverall the atmosphere felt much darker than any superhero movie that has come before it, and I like that, as the DC finally found its own identity instead of copying the formula Marvel are masters at.\nDespite liking the grittiness of the movie, some of the violence sorrounding Wonder Woman, felt completely out of place, as I just couldn't imagine that she would have the mindset to absolutely obliterate bad guys, even if the whole story is set in a darker universe.The Wonder Woman theme to be played every single time she is in action was a great choice for the first or second time she appeared on screen, but the fifth time, it was just irritating. The slow motion effects as-well was way over the top, but I guess that's just his style.\nBarry Allan also got a lot more screen time, and I actually managed to become more invested than I was when watching the theatrical cut or any other \"The Flash content\". Despite enjoying his character ark a lot more, he sometimes just ended up being the forced comedic relief and other times his humor and one liners worked to perfection. It was just a hit or miss for me, all depending on the situation.\nThe rest of the justice league played their comic book character to almost perfection, and I love that I came to care more for Aquaman, Wonderwoman, Ben Affleck's performance as the Batman was great this time around, and certainly Cyborg, the heart and soul of the movie was amazing, but I must say \"God damh this guy is powerful!\"The whole campaign and 4 year fight from the fans was amazing to see, and I'm so grateful and happy for everyone, including Zack Snyder, for being able to show his version and story. Congratulations to him, and what an amazing achievement to have the ability to hit the excitement level that the Snyder cut has developed since 2017.Honestly the best DC movie I have ever seen! I hope that Zack Snyder gets to continue the story, as I just want more of this universe and see where the story goes from here, and if that's the case, than superhero fans are in for a wild ride!\n#RestoreSnyderVerse9/10", "The Best DC Movie of All": "The movie Justice League was made by Zack Snyder and it is a literally the director's version. The movie is action adventure and the cast in this movie is from Ben Affleck,Henry Cavil, Gal Gadot and so on.In short, the film tells about group of superheroes who were found and brought together by Batman to become a great team. The reason for their meeting was because of the awakening of the ancient apocalyptic box called \"mother box\" and because of the invaders who wanted them to destroy the world and so that the great conqueror Darkside could ascend the throne.In general, the film has everything like drama, a lot of action and a dose of fiction, also a lot of good acting.

I didn't hate the old one but this one was just better.Cyborg's story was fine, it wasn't necessary but I'm glad it was in the movie.I liked wonder woman in this movie, she was very mature and wise which is one of the things I like about her.and that's pretty much it!\nThis movie was bloated with unnecessary scenes. there's a reason it's 4 hours.everyone at all times has to be so cool and super edgy and emo! Jeez. how about moderation!what was up with the music?! it's so bad! they just start playing music at some weird unnecessary times that didn't even match the scene! it reminded me of Godzilla 1998 that just had too much music all the time!have anyone noticed in all the wonder woman scenes instead of her theme music, they just play someone yelling! yeah, someone just yelling! go watch the amazon and wonder woman scenes and you'll see. they did it at least a dozen times!what's up with all the slow motion scenes! people just walking(it's slow motion) coming out of the coffee shop(it's slow motion) looking at each other(it's slow motion) remembering stuff(it's slow motion) middle of the fight(it's slow motion) I think if you play all the slow motion scenes in this movie the normal speed the movie will be 3 hours, that's how much slow motion scenes it had!oh god and the cringe! so so much cringe! why did they made this movie so cheesy and cringey!the appearance of Darkseid in this movie was completely unnecessary. lets face it, his appearance was just fan service to make people excited! and they didn't even do a good job with it cuz it was so forced!Pretty much everything about Aquaman was ruined here! his whole story line and conversations didn't make any sense! I admit I don't remember much about him from the first JL 2017 movie cuz that movie wasn't any good either, but I think he was better there. and all the times we had to look at Amber Fart's face just made me sick!And that epilogue was so forced and cringey! just why did they make the epilogue? oh right, fan service!Did the previous DCU movies brought people's standards for a good superhero movie so low that they're just losing their mind for this wreck!\nfor a good time watch the DC animated universe movies. those are some good superhero movies, start with \"JL the Flashpoint paradox\" and \"Justice league War\".I didn't get my hopes up for this movie and I was still disappointed!", "Thank you Zack and to everyone else who wanted this!": "I can't express how great a film this is.

The time however flew by in a what seemed like a very short moment. When compared to the mess of the original release this was so much better. The characters had story arcs that made sense, those strange scenes from the original now joined together and fitted in place. The film was dark at times, but built each character fully. Gone was the comedy and stupidity of the final scenes. The justice league were exposed on a universal scale, giving potential to bigger, even darker themes. Bring it on!", "Review after First-seating.": "One of the biggest gripes that I had with the theatrical cut was the non existent character's backstory.

Four hours to kill in the safety of my COVID free home. I was really impressed. The characters were so much deeper and real enough to bleed. It's surprising how much character expo did for this movie. The addition of Darkseid and the motivations behind Steppenwolf's actions made me feel sorry for him. It became a great movie. Whaddyaknow? It should have been at least two films to be honest.That was the good. The addition of the post-apocalyptic, injustice universe could have been left out. At that point, it felt like they were just patching in anything they could find from the cutting room floor.Everything up to the Injustice set-up was cherry.", "Snyder rules": "Yes a very good film.4 hours of compulsive viewing.I loved Dawn of the dead and think zack snyder films are great.This is 4 hours of a proper story with great action and it just works.", "Good graphics. That's all. Story is awful n so many useless scenes": "The graphics and action is good but that's all there's to it. The story is nothing but another avengers endgame. Totally out of character for most characters. Plus so many useless pointless scenes. What for? To make a 4 hour movie? It could've been 2:30h without losing a single story line. So many scenes with just music and facial expressions that go on forever, I actually fast forwarded thru many scenes. Wouldn't pay a dime for this movie but would watch it for free when there's nothing better to watch. That's all. Donno why it got high rating, probably coz ppl just wanna watch action scenes with a lot of carnage but when it comes to the story, I doubt it came into consideration. As for the actors, I happen to love most of them and the rest did just as well.", "Good Movie Better Than The First Try!": "Jack Snyder's Justice League.This version was an appreciable improvement on the first iteration of this saga. Fans will overlook the strange pacing, clunky script or wooden acting for the bigger picture.For those not lovers of this franchise this was 4 hours of laboured torture however why are you watching this if your not a fan.The CGI was much improved and the detailing was spectacular.

Each character has depth and you are actually invested during the final battle. Although I knew they were gonna win , I still felt worried about the character's fate. The absence of the stupid one-liners by Aquaman and the Flash made it so much better. I actually felt that the characters had more than one-dimension. The 4:3 aspect ratio was also quite cool.

I disagree with any review above 6 starsWhat I liked- the OST was incredible, the visuals and CGI were great and the majority of actors in the film (in particular: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams and Ezra Miller)However, the story was bland and stretched out. After 2 hours I started to give up. Only the final fight woke me up. The direction was pretty basic as were a few action scenes. Even though it's different from the 2017 version, I felt as if I was watching the same film again at times. Gal Gadot was terrible in her role, Jason Momoa and Rya Fisher could've done better to.Overall, overrated and average.", "Not sure what the hype is about???": "It is a 4+ hour movie, about 2 hours longer than would have been OK.

Really??? Flash see everything essentially moving in slow motion, but missed everyone else leaving the roof top??? Way to much \"Slow-Mo\" dragging it out even further.

There was elements of the first but only because they were Snyder's pieces. This by far has entered my top 10 of all-time movies. Definitely around the last two avenger movies.

Sure, it is very long and yes, it is peak Snyder with all the visual overload you'd expect, but there's no denying it's a more cohesive and engaging version of the movie.", "Absolutely amazing.": "What can I say. When I walked out of the cinema in 2017 after watching Justice League at the cinema I had never been that upset by a film. Of course we all knew that Zack had left the film and we were told that Joss Whedon had done some reshoots in Zack's style. But what it turned out we actually got was 75% of Whedon reshoots (not anywhere in the same world as Zack's style), a complete mess of a story, ruined characters & characters cut out we were all so eager to see, terrible CGI, visually horrible to look at and a terrible Danny Elfman score not in keeping with what went before in MOS and BvS.Somehow though, I always knew we would one day get to see Zack's original vision, I had no idea we would get the 4hour masterpiece we did get. Even though Whedon did keep the spine of the original story, he cut the heart out of the movie and put completely unnecessary reshot scenes in. I just cannot believe the execs watched this version and deemed it unwatchable, they (and Geoff Johns) must have really had it in for Snyder to do what they did. Family tragedy or not, Snyder was fired, simple as that, and as soon as he was out the door, they moved Whedon in to change the whole thing. How they thought it would work for the best I do not know. I'm kind of glad it all happened the way it did, as if Snyder had stayed on, we would have got a Snyder film theatrically, but it would have been a heavily compromised version as the execs were butting their noses in and demanding changes (Steppenwolf's look for example). This way, we got 100% Snyder, with the exception of WB not letting him use a Green Lantern for the final scene, hence we got a bit more Martian Manhunter.I'm a big fan of the Snyder universe he built, loved MOS, he gave us a Superman film with action we had never seen Superman do before on film, BvS explored how the world would really react to an alien coming to earth, and I really can't explain why the critics gave it so much grief (more people who just have it in for Snyder because he's just too nice) and I think you will find it is one of the most talked about movies ever, then ZS's Justice League, a great introduction to characters never been on film, giving everyone equal time to shine, black suit Superman, Darkseid and so much more. What they did in 6 months to get this film ready to be seen is just a miracle considering they had to revisit the entire film, scenes that had been finished had to be put into the new aspect ratio, and finished the scenes they cut from the theatrical version and were therefore never finished at the time, a few tiny bits of the CGI is a bit shaky, but overall the CGI is second to none, OG Steppenwolf for example just has to be seen. The whole movie would need colour grading to Snyder's satisfaction, not the cartoon colour look preferred by Whedon.I'm not going to go through the film scene by scene, the movie was just too epic in scale. A scale not seen before in a CBM. The whole film was on a different level to what we've seen before either from DC or Marvel (yes, even End Game). I loved seeing it as a 4 hour movie, but I equally think it would have worked split into episodes.I'd love to see Snyder's original plan of a part 2 and 3. With the WB merger with Discovery and a big shake up of the people in charge at DC you never do know what might happen. Snyder's going to be busy with Rebel Moon for Netflix for a good few years or so, with spin offs and sequels to Snyder's own IP over at Netflix he could be tied up over there for life, but fingers crossed something might happen after if the (hopefully) new people in charge of WB/DC have any brains in their heads.Vvv4&\nEdit: NOV 2022 - Well, Gunn and Safron have just taken control at the newly named 'DC Studios', Vaslav has just announced 'We won't have 4 Batman's running around' so, I think Battinson is safe in what they are doing in their stand alone films but I do think Keaton's return as old fart Batman will be gone, hopefully they have struck a deal with the best Batman.

One that respects the viewer's time and gets you entertained the whole time. For me that's enough for a 6 or a 7 but adding Snyder's hard work to get this thing released he deserves to get a memorable rate and also to be remembered for showing us these characters in a decent way despite all the problems and tragedies he had to overcome.", "Laughably bad": "Snyder directs every scene like it's a bad Calvin Klein commercial. The dialogue and plot would be bad if a six year old wrote it. The acting is appalling. The CGI ignores all laws of physics and therefore looks utterly fake.It is truly terrible in every single aspect.", "while an improvement, high raters are too busy comparing Whedon's version to see all the unnecessary garbage": "Sure, it's better than the original. That doesn't make it a cinematic masterpiece. I could easily cut out 30-60 minutes of unnecessary things in this 4+ hour exhaustathon and still be left with a coherent (and likely more cohesive) story. Too much slow-mo, Wonder Woman's intro scene is absolutely dumb and spooky singing repeats egregiously every time she is on screen. Steppenwolf looks better and has an actual story and doesn't use the word \"Mother\" outside of \"Motherbox\" so that's a plus, but it's weighed down by the fact that his dialogue with Dasaad is repetitive and wastes time. Not to mention Darkseid being written into the story would have been cool if he had an actual backstory or motivation. Basically Snyder just swapped out one for another. Darkseid is an evil guy who does evil things, who apparently got amnesia from an axe wound to the shoulder? Strange use of my least favorite trope of all time.There are a lot of little things here and there I think could have been nixed for a better viewing experience. We don't need ladies chanting and smelling Aquaman's shirt from the water's edge. We don't need big chunks of the flash intro scenes, and we can probably remove Aquaman's and Wonder Woman's introductions entirely as well as they tell us nothing we don't already know at this point. The addition of Martian Manhunter was quite hamfisted and absolutely did not gel. Did I mention the slow-mo? There is soooo much, holy mackerel.I think it doesn't really make sense for them to revive superman, I think it raises ethical concerns and issues with adverse reactions to the Motherbox. Still, they do it. I could have seen Steppenwolf doing it, and then a fight where the JL needs to convince Kal-El they are on his side, it would also serve as a reference to the premonitions of Steppenwolf working with Superman, and would pre-establish a relationship between the two that would make his turn all the more tragic and understandable. Eh, maybe next time.Also, auto defense system??? Really? Cyborg has control over all of the world's technology, including the entire human economy and nuclear weapons aresenal, but cannot stop his hand from attacking superman based on a threat assessment with zero damage control contingencies? Talk about manufactured conflict.The movie really picks up towards the end and I felt myself feeling a little hyped for the showdown. It was significantly better than Whedon's, even without the Flash sequence at the end, which was pretty neat until he kept monologuing. Give this guy like two lines and let him focus on going back in time. Sheesh.Jared Leto's inclusion was interesting but not something I'm putting any bets on returning. Snyder's joker definitely suits Leto better, I guess we'll have to wait and see.6.5/10.

From the breathtaking visuals, stunning cinematography, top-notch CGI/special effects (for the most part, still unbelievable how they did it with a $70m budget in a few months), incredible directing and phenomenal acting to the drama, serious tone, intelligent story and deeply compelling characterizations of all the main characters. Also delivering one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard and some of the best action sequences in cinematic history. The film is also literally a slideshow of motivational and inspirational quotes. There's also a lot of cool parallels, Easter eggs, references, and symbolism present that may add more depth to the film. And let's not forget about the god-tier cast.

That's cause the brailliants of zack, I'm not that kind of people who make comparison between directors but in this case we can not, specially the writing was perfect every scene has a role and a cause of making, and that's what makes this one better.. The acting.. I'm not mentioning ben, Henry, daine, Amy, those are above ratings. From what I saw zack repeated all emotional scene of gal gadot and kept the fights Scences, we all knew Gal's performance Upgrades in the last few years, ray is the heart of the movie, Jason as usual badass and ezra is better than the old version. I agree that this version can be too long but hey it's not a theatrical version so it can be acceptable, we all waiting for the sequels to see how it ends\n#restoresnyderverse\n#thankYouZack", "Superior Justice League": "This is almost a completely different movie!

I enjoyed every moment but some were unnecessary quite long, I think it was meant to be a series of 6 episodes.

I watched the whole thing in one 4 hour block and I wasn't bored for a minute. All of the characters are hugely improved compared the theatrical cut but the biggest surprise for me was steppenwolf, he was great in the movie and he was actually threating, everyone in the main cast also brought their A game. Affleck was great as batman, Gal Gadot as always is great as wonder woman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman really good as well, even Ezra Miller and ray Fisher really grew on me, also henry cavill, while not in the film as much as the others, he absolutely rocks it as superman, oh and please give me a sequel, I want to see more DARKSEID!!!

If you're just a casual fan watch the studio cut.", "DC cracked the SuperHero Movies' Formula": "What a massive improvement from the former Justice League. Zack Snyder knew and had envisioned what a franchise like Justice League might become if treated correctly. There are a few plotholes and some terrible CGI but they aren't that irritating. The origins of Cyborg and the introduction of Barry Allen were integral to the film's plot which were cut from the Joss Whedon film for some reason. Batman seems like a true leader and Aquaman has a lot explained about his character thanks to the previous solo Aquaman film which has helped this film. Zack Snyder has increased the blood and gore which all the superhero films need but shy away because for some reason they think the kids are the only audience watching. NO!!!, the movie ahs the right amount of blood and gore and makes the film more enjoyable. Superman and Steppenwolf have a lot of depth to their character which makes the film seem realistic. The editing though is a bit chopped up and mixed and matched which can be a bit infuriating, but the film on its own is a true masterpiece for DCEU.

If I was, I'd still not be impressed by the over use of slo-mo action, terrible scripted lines and Ben Affleck still as Batman. He doesn't cut the mustard. Never will.It's a Marvel makeover, but they are certainly more enjoyable (again those films were not for me, but I was still impressed with some of those films).\"300\" was a good use of these effects.

Yes, I used the word masterpiece because not once was I distracted to look at the time. I did stop to cook some lunch for my little one, but once I picked it back up I was sucked right back into the film.WOW, amazing how different the two versions are not only in tone but pacing. I used to say the Best Zack Snyder film was Man of Steel, now I have to knock that down a notch and put Justice League (The Snyder Cut) as the best film he has ever made., which now knocks his Dawn of the Dead down to #3.So much more character development, tons of holes closed up quite nicely, I mean there are still some but name me a film without holes in it.All in all the wait was worth it and now I can rid myself of the blu-ray disc for Josstice League.", "4 hours i'll never get them back": "I have read the ratings comments and most of the people gave a 9 or 10 comparing with the movie made in 2017.Yes, if you compare it with that one you can give a 10 or 20 to this one, but if you just rate this movie you just can't give more than a 3.The movie is boring as hell,\nThey take 3 hours to recruit the team meanwhile the only things happen is some cgi fights and talkings.Very predictible,with lots of clichees\nVery dissapointed.", "Cultural Vandalism": "I didn't like the Joss Whedon version of this movie, but this is a much longer and much worse product from the same meat. It'll have some love because it's a longer movie and certainly, a more coherent watching experience than what Joss could put together from what he had to work with and what he had to compromise. But whereas the Whedon version was simply bad, this version is infinitely more maddening, poorly plotted and poorly forward thinking, and supremely more horrific and horror oriented experience than any DC movie that I've ever experienced. Zack Snyder's Justice League is a hateful mess, from a director who has said he hates comic books.", "A redemption!!": "Just finished watching and it's a 'heaven and earth' difference from the 2017 realese. Thank you Zack for redeeming this movie.", "Wao this is a Movie!!!": "Wao, tremendous movie is really like watching an episodes of the animated series but with a level of detail to the maximum. The story intrigues you from minute 1 and I was breathtaking with the scenes, Bruce Wayne has a positive and leadership attitude. Tremendous performances, music, and special effects.This opens endless stories.It is totally different from the one that premiered in 2017. The Villain is spectacular, you identify yourself with him. Steppenwolf is the perfect representation of the family pressure that young people go through. he is a villain with sense.", "It's slightly better but mostly pointless": "People are in desperate need of entertainment to have like this\nHe fixed a couple of plot points but it's still not a good movie it's bleak, the aspect ratio is distracting...\nThe CGI and visuals are so bad, the music is awful.\nThe dialogues everyone are always taking too much time telling us what we already see on screen.\nThe consolation prize, it's the fact finally fans had their voices heard", "Impressed": "I wish I never saw the original. This movie was great and I was tainted the whole time by the original. I fell asleep the first time I watched it (was drunk and it is a 4 hour movie) but this time watched it as it was meant to be watched. Good movie and hopefully the first release didn't ruin the continuation.", "Justice League Redeemed": "Going into this, I had hope that the movie would be good. It was everything I wanted and more! When the Flash time travels at the end was one of my favorite moments in the whole movie. Flash and Cyborg were the mvps of this movie. I still can't get over the Flashs' running form, it's just so damn ugly. This moving really makes the audience obtain a lot due to it being 4 hours long, which isn't really an issue as much as it is a statement. When Darkseid is shown killing the Justice League, I got chills and seeing his Omega Beams was amazing. And the scene between Batman and Joker was hilarious and so dark at the same time. I'm so happy Zack Snyder got to finish his movie and I hope he continues to make more DCEU films.", "BREAKS MY HEART": "Ok I will sound like a hater but I'll try my best not to. You can stop reading here or carry on. IDK man, this one much better than theatrical cut Justice League but still doesn't cut it for me. I mean, I literally have no emotional string to any of the character, the villain is just basic villain to rule the universe (MEH). The build up isnt feel to right. You just add character and hope people can relatee. And I assure you, that 8/10 is hugely affected by the fanboys.Idk why I expected this movie only for these detailed version of Justice League. Probably it's because I was expecting a different dish, only to be served with more seasoned. Well..", "Absolute thriller": "Never a dull moment in the entire 4 hour movie.

A literal comic book come to life and gets better and better with each subsequent viewing. 10/10.", "Flash and Cyborg": "Zack Snyder's Justice League Bring Justice to the Fans who really value his work. There is lot of Great Moment in this Movie; The Moment Barry Allen was in the Pet shop trying to get a job then he met Iris west there. These two people had great chemistry even in just a short period of time, this highlight when The car accident occur, Zack put a beautiful score in that moment, it shows lots of mixed emotions in that moment. On the other hand, Cyborg. Cyborg definitely was the Heart of this movie; Ray Fisher done a great job in this film while battling his own personal fight. His Cyborg and Ezra's Flash added thrills in the moment when the Mother boxes explode and barry needs to rewind the time to save them, this Duo give me a great moment and feelings for that movie. Love all the cast and moment but this two just stand out in that film.", "Absolutely a masterpiece": "When I saw the first release in 2017 I was disappointed. There is many gabs in the story, lack of explanation for many things, and the premise was presented, and the conclusion was offset.But with this version I was able to see and understand everything, it's absolutely amazing.Honestly, I never thought DC can pull something like this.However, many people complain from the lengthy showtime, however I found it fascinating specially during the pandemic where there is not much to do.", "Transcendent.": "This film captures an incredible scale but suffers from a lack of tying up loose ends. Everything feels quite splayed out when it's all said and done.This is like giving me one LoTR film and saying, \"that's it, that's all of it.\"I personally don't think this film was enough to get many haters to switch sides but I am sure that the all those dedicated #restorethesnyderverse people will make it happen.Incredible achievement. Fantastic job, Zack", "Justice League, finally!": "The film as it should have been. Much more character development and emotion. 4 hours felt more like 2 hours.

The original theatrical release did a hack job on the story. The story in this release is much more cohesive, meaningful and the characters more relatable.4 hours of this movie pass by quicker than 2 hours of the original theatrical movie.", "I can't": "Every time I watch a DC movie. I'm reminded that I'm a marvel fan. What was the point of removing Super Man's stubble from every movie? The effect looked not blended well to look real. It looked so bad.", "Amazing!!!and i hated original justice league ..": "This film is full with of emotions...beautiful done,amazing...just prooved that you dont need 23 film prior to do an amazing movie with all the superheroes..", "A VAST IMPROVEMENT!": "The original film that Zack Snyder didnt get to finish and that Joss Whedon and WB made a collossal mess up with was made right with this. At 4 hours it seems its too long but honestly it felt like a 90 minute piece whereas the previous version felt 12 hours yet was only 2. Zack Snyder's vision was in full flight seperated into chapters and made alot more sense storywise. Each scene looked sharper and with the extra content has much more depth. The basis of the original is there but isnt hacked or rushed and whilst the additional stuff makes the runtime climb, its so much more worth it. The chapters allow people to watchi it in segments if you cant watch the 4 hours. For me the best DC movie since \"The Dark Knight\" and up there with \"Avengers Infinity War\" and \"Avengers Endgame\"", "Better than Whedon's? Well....": "It was good to see an ensemble hero film where the protagonists and villains (that need it) get more back-story to explain their motivations. There's also no denying that the plot, regarding a standard planet-conquering alien, replete with army of cannon fodder clones, collecting some ancient McGuffin boxes that are necessary to complete their evil plans (aren't they always?) is the most predictable and recycled story in all of super herodom.I can't say it was massively better than Whedon's version, but I guess the fact you get twice as much story to absorb without it getting boring gives it the edge by default, and a 4 hour film that remains watchable throughout is an achievement in itself. The unremarkable dialogue and weak one-liners were probably the most disappointing thing about this version.It's got Snyder's trademark monotone colour palette and slow motion action shots, unconventional choices of soundtrack and long physics-defying action scenes that are all CGI. So I it delivers exactly what you might expect, in a longer form, and is in my opinion not a patch on Watchmen, which is easily still his best film and the only one of his I would recommend to track down, even to people who aren't particularly fans of hero films.", "Found it quite similar": "I found it very little differences in Zac Snyder's justice league compare to the regular justice league. This may just be me not being able to focus properly on a movie. But it was very similar same plot and storyline just little details added in, but all-round a really great movie and definitely worth your time.", "Vast improvement over the original, although it still feels kinda dumb and bloated": "The original Justice League was a pretty baffling disaster of a movie. Structured so poorly that the plot felt completely nonsensical, full of blatant technical flaws, lacking any character development, and rife with the dirty fingerprints of extensive studio-meddling. -- I was glad to see the Zack Snyder cut actually did fix (most) of those issues.\nHowever, I don't think the movie deserves the 10/10 scores fans are heaping on it. Disregarding the fact that the whole thing inevitably feels extremely \"weird\" - essentially you're paying to watch a re-release of a movie that came out only three years ago - its 4 hour running time did make it a bit of a slog to watch, for me. The scenes and dialogue come off as being a bit self-indulgant at times, the whole thing feels like the work of a director who's obviously trying very hard to distance his version from the original in every way possible.\nIf you're a hardcore comicbook/superhero genre fan I'd wholly recommend it, you'll definitely enjoy this movie and it does feel like DC redeeming itself in a lot of ways. However, I would NOT recommend it for the average movie-goer, if only for the fact that its overly long running time (and distracting 4:3 aspect ratio...) will be a turn off for most people.", "Redemption and Vindication at its best!!": "E-P-I-C! This is redemption and vindication at its best!! Everything about film made sense, characters redeemed themselves & a lot of wow factor from start to end. It was emotional, story driven & majestic from the music score to the action sequences.This is what Justice League should have been 4 years ago and we're very, very grateful we had our voice be heard. Thank you to the cast, the crew, HBO Max & Warner Media. Thank you to Zack Snyder, Deborah Snyder & AFSP. And most of all from one fan to all the fans who fought this, we did it everyone, you are all superheroes.Godspeed Autumn Snyder10/10!", "Overlong, overwrought but a stunning improvement": "This is a completely different film to the original theatrical release. It's a sprawling, mini-series-esque depiction of a group of lost heroes searching for a solution to the apocalypse. Too much slow-motion, and the pace can be frustrating - but there are undeniable pleasures to watching this epic story unfold.", "It is a MASTERPIECE": "It is just a Masterpiece. No Words needed to describe it any further. If you are familiar with the previous movies ( MOS and BVS Ultimate Edition). You will feel the epicness of this Movie. It is so much more than just a Comic-Book Movie.

It is overly long and some of the scenes drag. Some of the effects are a little rushed too but I can forgive this point given we weren't even meant to watch this film.Warner Bros. are a disgrace for not sticking by Zack, giving him time to heal from his personal grief, so he could come back and get this film made. Instead they rushed it out after a dire hack job with both writing and direction. Most fans would have been fine to wait, to ensure the product was right but - there you go.This is much more character driven and more time spent with Cyborg was nice too, seeing more of his story. I actually cared about the heroes this time.Shame I had to see Amber Heard's toxic face in it though.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is perfect for DC fans (mild spoilers)": "So first thing I have to say is personally it lived up to the hype, there are a few minor things that bugged me but I'll go with the good first:1. The biggest Justice of this movie was given to Ray Fisher and his portrayal of Cyborg, his and his fathers arcs were awesome and was probably the character I cared about the most2. The Flash is way better, and I mean waaaaaaay better, he's still the comic relief but also shown to be much more in control of his powers as opposed to push, run and save 1 family, he is the reason the team survives3. The pacing for a 4 hour movie was damn near perfect, it's split up into acts with each act containing at least 1 action scene to keep people entertained but also drove character developed keeping the viewer invested4. The action is much better and longer: the MA15 (Australia) or R rating (America) made characters much more badass, Wonder Woman chopping parademons In half and their heads off was awesome, seeing limbs blown apart and Steppenwolf be menacing slicing open Atlanteans and Amazons, I swear there were so many moments where I was like \"oh damn\". And the team fought together, Batman got so many good hand to hand combat moments which he didn't in Whedons cut, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Superman hitting Steppenwolf around like a baseball, incredibly satisfying5. Justice for Darkseid: in his very brief appearance he was badass6. Story and character motivations were much better, especially Batman and SteppenwolfNow onto the bad:1. Over-use of slow-mo and some average CGI (mainly during the Themiscyra fight in act 1)2. Score was a bit of a let down compared to the one from MoS which is one of my favourite movie scores, wish Hans Zimmer did it but still had its moments for sure3. Volkos hair lmao, why they do my man Willem Dafoe dirty like thatOverall 9.5 out of 10, tied favourite comic movie with Infinity War", "BIGGER AND BETTER!!!": "First of all it's a totally different movie. Watching Joss Whedon's JL was rather confusing in 2017. A polarizing movie like BvS still had its fanbase but JL was unanimously despised. well, there's no shock about it. It was the of DC pretending to be what it wasn't a carefree superhero popcorn flick. The dark melancholic and gritty of MOS was vanished, stepphenwolf as the antagonist generated barely any fearing anyone why was the patchy. Why weren't its subplots explode significantly we had all these questions.\nThe more you read about the behind the scenes of the movie justice league and the life-altering experiences of zack snyder while making it you realize why there has been such a mass movement regarding wanting his version of the movie.\njoss whedon the man who has directed multiple avengers finished the project however it is clear that the theatrical version that audiences saw was much different than snyder's version of the movie.\njosh whedon's version of the justice league is therefore mockingly titled the joostice league assumed to have been only one-fourth of snyder's version.\nThis is another movie all together that made me emotional excited and most importantly invested something that was entirely missing in joss whedon's version and I'll exactly tell you why the good it isn't pretending to be something else. What i love about the dc universe is when it sticks to its theme of dark gritty and compelling shades when it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't in the first place. With snyder's version of justice league we are reintroduced to the same theme that i fell in love with the movie.\nThe cgi of the snyder card doesn't look jarring as the original product steppenwolf and his new armor actually looks menacing and intimidating and not a poor man's fancy dress competition.\nThe movie will end on a cliffhanger that was originally a part of snyder's trilogy with the justice league will we ever get it we never know but I can only wish for the snyder verse to be restored. The wait honestly was truly worth it.", "Vindication is a four letter word (Zack)!!!!!!": "I thought this day would never come. Absolutely amazing.

The hype is real.", "Perfect setting of a more mature tone to a comic book movie": "The character motivations are so perfectly set in just one film, especially for the newly introduced characters. The cinematography catches your attention just like piece of art in every scene, brings back the characters to life from the comic book pages. Heart warming!", "If you were tasked with conquering 50,000 worlds, you'd have permanent sadface too...": "I personally found 'good'/'bad' aspects to just about every single thing in this. Sadly, gone is Batfleck's exchange with Barry Allen about saving 'one person'. Instead we have super-serious recruiting scenes (Aquaman's being a prime example) and Batsy miraculously NOT dying even when there's multiple instances where he clearly should've (apparently now Alfred can make Bats' gauntlets immune to Superman's heat vision. WTF?). Being one of the seemingly few who DON'T think the sun shines out of Henry Cavill's butt, I continue to be unimpressed with his Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman who all seem exactly the same to me/like there's no clear differences in these identities (speaking of, are his and Bruce's secret identities now public knowledge since characters use their names all willy-nilly?).Not until Disc 2 does zombie Supes beat up all his teammates, then he just glares/grunts his way through scenes until Lois Lame appears. The only part I liked was his reunion with his mum who really should've been the one to snap him out of his zombie state instead of dull-as-dishwater Lois. Seriously, Clark&Lois scenes bore me to tears/are like watching paint dry. Martha had a nice emotional scene earlier about what it was like to lose Clark...oh, wait, that was just Martian Manhunter posing as Martha. Nevermind. And in case Snyder hadn't made it clear he hates bright colours, Supes now dresses only in a black suit which some might deem 'cool-looking' or whatever, but it's just another example of how afraid Snyder is to have his Superman be inspiring/like REAL Superman.Thankfully, one character who IS inspiring (especially to kids) is Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, who provides an entertaining rescue scene and remains generally awesome in amongst all these angst-filled grim/dark/broody characters. Unfortunately, Snyder can't resist the urge to punish her for being one of the stand-outs by killing her (not once, but TWICE. The first being in a vision of a possible future and the second during the climax of the film...although it's undone. I personally wouldn't watch a DCEU that doesn't have Diana/WW in it). At least he allows her to get satisfying payback against Steppenwolf for killing so many of her equally awesome Amazonian sisters in another exciting (albeit bloodier/with lots of horse violence) action sequence.People have praised Victor Stone's/Cyborg's expanded role here, but I saw nothing much different to how he was in 'Josstice League'. He's still Cyboring (I didn't think it was possible to have a more humourless character than Batfleck or Superman), now there's just MORE of it. Flashbacks showing him playing football and with his mum (who believes cheating is fine so long as it's her SON doing it) were, I guess, intended to make us *care* about his character, but all I was paying attention to was that his mum wasn't watching the road before their fatal car accident, his dad gives him the highly questionable power to invade everyone's privacy (what ethics?) and Victor takes time out from helping Barry save the world to chat with a vision of his dearly-departed family.I've seen people reacting like Snyder stripped away everything that was 'annoying' about Barry/Flash from Whedon's JL and made him totally different. Um...what? He's still guilty of the hyper-speak, 'funny' one-liners and taking his sweet time saving people just because he CAN (kinda creepy how he strokes Iris West's hair and grabs a wiener before saving her life). I never hated Ezra Miller's Barry/Flash beforehand, but I saw no evidence of people's claim about this version being 'different'/'better'. Yes, he gets to be the hero of the film at the end along with Cyboring (though, annoyingly, it kinda renders all the others pointless/useless), but I always think how his superspeed being accompanied by electricity surrounding him seems really inconvenient (what if he had to save someone inside a metal container? Would they get electrocuted?). Thankfully, Barry's \"Oh sh--!\" reaction to zombie Supes glaring at him remains.Aquaman's like a Cyborg/Flash hybrid, both serious and kinda 'jokey'. After telling Bruce he wants nothing to do with him, he eventually comes around to helping and has some mildly amusing exchanges with Barry (including doing his own version of the evil monkey from Family Guy who lives in Chris' closet and dramatically points). I guess when this movie was being made they hadn't figured out how Atlanteans were going to speak underwater, so every scene with them talking requires being inside air bubbles (the few instances where they communicate in the water, it sounds like dolphin/whale sounds). Mera, who sports a different look and accent from the Aquaman film, gets one instance of being awesome (draining blood/other bodily fluids from Steppenwolf), but then is disappointingly forgotten about until the epilogue.Speaking of, people complained about the LotR trilogy's 'multiple endings', but this movie's already lengthy runtime is made even longer with a drawn-out conclusion that involves a 'Knightmare' sequence about presumably what the world will become if/when Darkseid takes over. Batsy, Cyboring, facial-haired armoured Flash and Mera have for some reason teamed up with Joe Manganiello's Deathstroke, and it's clear that all the fish jokes that were intended for Aquaman have been saved for Jared Leto's Joker (who's undergone a makeover, but is now more pretentious than ever) to direct at Mera (it also sucks that Harley Quinn's apparently departed in this future). Lastly, there's a tacked-on final scene involving Martian Manhunter. You know what would've reduced the film's runtime considerably? Less slow-mo sequences (which Snyder apparently believes even a seed from a hamburger bun deserves).Regarding the villains, I guess Sad Steppenwolf was supposed to be an improvement over the previous version (but now he's just a meme), while Darkseid gives Thanos a run for his money as biggest-big-bad-who-mostly-just-sits-on-his-butt (though Ares kicks said butt in a flashback which also features what appears to be a leftover from Snyder's 300 movie among other things). On the whole, I think this 'Snyder Cut' is fairly decent, but the hype's unwarranted. It's definitely the Snyderiest Snyder movie that ever Snydered.", "The Realistic Justic League": "This is a great art of 21century,\nI've ever seen\nIt's time to prove what real art\nis remaing in nowadaysI knew SnyderVerse must be\nrestore soon\nBest Cinematography,\nBest Picture,\nBest Song Track.", "Excellent Movie \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25": "After Dark Knight triology, this movie is lit \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. DC fans earned it.", "Over indulgence": "It should be viewed as a film study lesson, rather than a film to be enjoyed. Overly long, immature humour, and weak character motivations. Like every other Snyder film, the women are portrayed as idiots. Snyder does have a visually striking style to his frame, but that can't make up for under developed plot points or weak characters. The directors incessant use of slow motion is tedious, and adds to already over indulgent movie. The most criminal thing is the end 15 minutes which comprises of an out of context segment that ruins any drama or suspense for a sequel they set up in prior scene. It is easily better than the 2017 original, but there is easily over an hour of footage that can be removed to make a tighter, more palatable, and intriguing movie. They made a one star film into a 2 star film, which is an improvement.", "Million times better than the 2017 version.": "I'll start off by saying that I'm not the biggest Snyder fan. Both MOS and BVS, although not as terrible as JL 2017, did not satisfy me. I did enjoy both WW and Aqua-man solo movies.\nBut for this movie I'll will give full credit to ZS. He really deserves all the praise. This time we have strong characters, engaging storylines, amazing fight scenes, even the little humor they have works.\nSpeaking of characters, this time I was emotionally invested in all of them. Especially the Cyborg. The flash had way more important scenes than just pushing a pickup truck. Both Aqua man and WW were bad-ass. Batman still feels little odd among these super-powered beings, but he was the brains and planner for the team. And finally Superman, he is amazing in this movie. When is returns in the black suit, things get even better.\nSome negatives: the cgi still looks unpolished in some scenes, especially on Steppenwolf. The choreography in the action scenes sometimes feels slow and fake. I also hope they replace Amber heard in the future movies.\nOverall I had a blast watching this movie. Even the negative mentioned were minor things unlike in the 2017 version. This is what a Justice League movie should be.", "Better than previous but still mediocre": "If previous cut gets a 5 this cut gets 6-6.5.Movie was dragging too much sometimes.

I mean, for the rest of this century, we will have the Zack Snyder's Justice League.Simply epic.", "The second definition for Goosebumps.": "I have always been a fan of DCEU except the Justice League film but the one thing I did not expect from the Snyder Cut was that how it us gripped throughout its 4 hour runtime and each moment of the film is necessary and not forced unlike the original. The dark tone of the film with Superman flying again on Zimmer's score is a pure gem for Superman fans. All the other heroes are equally important in this film and not any side characters. Cyborg comes up as the soul of the film emotionally but it's Flash who steals the show in the climax. I guess it's one of the best scenes in the entire DCEU.", "Both Justice League films suck": "Is Zack Snyder's version better than Joss Wheedon's? Yes and no.Yes - it's got more content (but it's still exactly the same film). Some of the extended scenes are better, as well as some of the ones that got cut. The extended extra scenes help give the film more depth, especially since it's in the aftermath of Superman's apparent death.The 4 hour run-time wasn't bad, although I'm not sure I want to watch it again.No - it's exactly the same film - the extra bits don't actually change the film at all. It's obvious why WB wanted it changed - it would have sunk at the cinema. So they got Wheedon to basically trim it. He kept the main scenes, re-filmed a few parts and lightened the colour.Did Wheedon do a good job? Not really, but chances are he did the best he could with what he had. He re-shot a few bits, added some extra dialogue and turned a long, muddled film into a shorter, muddled film.Aside from a few extended scenes in the Snyder version, it's 90% the same film. Apparently Wheedon used only 10% of what Synder shot, which sounds like the Synder cut should be some amazing film with lots of stuff never seen before. It's really not. It's exactly the same film with more stuff in it - yes, there's stuff you've never seen, but it's either extended scenes or a little more backstory. The parts that Wheedon re-shot are only bits and pieces, and really just additions/extra dialogue to what Snyder already had.The ending of Snyder's version is better, and the inclusion of Darkseid - like most of the Synder version, it gives more/better context. Wheedon's ending was more muddled and random. Steppenwolf's weird head still annoys me in both versions.The bottom line is that Justice League is still the B-grade Marvel Avengers. The corny Wonder Woman guitar riff still sucks. Cyborg is a lame character. He's got more backstory in ZS's version, but it's still rushed and ultimately empty. The Flash still has 90% the same lines, although Wheedon added a few funny ones.The story of Justice League is still weak and both film's badly written/plotted/paced. The story ultimately tries to cram too much in, which is probably more WB's fault than anything else. Rather than spending years building up individual characters, they tried to chuck them all into an ensemble film and skip the pesky character building.It's worth seeing, but it's ultimately the same muddled film. It's in some ways better, and in some ways worse. The DCEU took the wrong approach in building their own cinematic world, and the result is/are these films.", "This is what Goosebumps feels like.": "Maybe this is the best superhero gathering from Dc.

In lots of scenes you can almost predict what the characters say, there's nothing original in the writing, and there are massive chunky scenes dedicated to exposition only.

It offers nothing new to movie goers once you look beneth the visual effects and unless you are (for whatever reason) a Zack Snyder fan or a huge DC fan there isn't much here.", "The resurrection of the dead": "What Zack Snyder has accomplished with this version is incredible. The 2017 version that was widely criticized, was completely transformed to an epic comic-based movie, and without a doubt, in one of the best of its kind of all time. Zack Snyder knew how to put everything in its place, as it should have always been. The messages that are transmited in this version are extremely eloquent, the effects are excellent, the music is majestic and fits perfectly at all moments. The film is always accompanied by that gloomy air that characterizes DC comics, but without being overwhelming. Zack Snyder knew how to put himself in the shoes of the comic book lover, of every boy or girl who created animations in his head of what he or she read in a comic book. He knew how to express the feelings of millions of fans in the world. And I am sure that the vast majority of us have been satisfied with the result, and we also want more. Zack Snyder must continue with his project. The SnyderVerse must continue. Today, no one knows better than he what the true DC comics lover wants and longs to see from his favorite heroes being brought into live action movies.", "Fully comprehensible movie and feels complete.": "Excellent, excellent storytelling. Cinematography on point. Emotions, character depth, character exploration, are fantastic. We finally feel a connection to all the new entrants to the DCEU. Didn't feel any connection or reason to be behind the flash, cyborg, and aquaman in the first version. But in this you get that missing element. Their brief but important backstory is much needed to build that emotional attachment to the audience. Plus the introduction to Darkseid and Martian Manhunter, excellent! And that epilogue, that was just simply a perfect ending. As well as a great nightmare session leading to so many questions and opening up the DC universe. Well done Snyder. Warner Bros, you need to revive this universe in this man's vision.

Everything is upgraded from the story to the visuals & my main gripe with the 2017 version, the score; JunkieXL brings back old themes from the past DCEO movies & gives each member their own memorable score. Also watch the B&W its so stunning to watch! #Restorethesnydervers!", "Nice Upgrade": "Basically i find the implementation of justice league as a film aria rather slight. But the zac snider version is a lot better than the older cinema version. It's dark, which i don't really like, just as the color temperature change is a matter of taste.

Just a few moments of forced wokeness amounting up to about three separate sentences/sentiments that could easily have been left out.", "Possibly One of the Best Movies in several Years": "This movie is daunting at its 4 hour length but it is constantly telling so much story that it needs that time to do it well. This movie was made prior to introducing several of the characters. Zach was able to give them an overview and go into depth on several others. He explains plot points and makes it easy to engage with the characters and invest in the movie. I wanted to watch it again after only watching the first hour. A story driven movie is something we have been missing so this was just perfect. It was dark overall which is what we have come to expect but what would you expect if this was the end of the world and all that stood against it were a few heroes. The cast played their roles perfectly and the characters were allowed to be heroic. Cyborg was a huge asset in this version of the film. The whole team came together and saved the day. The big bad was developed well and Sadly only teased at in this film. Maybe down the road we will see that one in action. Thank you Zach Snyder for making this film! It is amazing and I hope that this would yield a sequel of equal stature. Absolutely wonderful!", "It's good": "I think this JL is well done and Zack's best installment by far in the DCEU.

Obviously but this movie isn't the movie which was planned by Zack way back in 2017. It feels overstuffed with a lot of things and doesn't hold them up to the end. Definitely like all the Snyder fans they think that visuals make a movie great but it isn't. Yes but the visuals are actually good but sometimes it feels really bad like the CG DARKSEID. He doesn't look real. The problem with CGI is that you only notice it when it's bad. And now the Snyder problem as always. Snyder let his visuals tell the story instead he should let his story to show the visuals. This movie shouldn't even exist because it proves that toxic fandoms could win. Snyder fans are the most vocal fans community among all the CBM directors and according to them everything Snyder makes is a masterpiece but in real it isn't. The only directors who made real masterpieces in this genre are James mangold(Logan), Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 2) and Christopher Nolan(the dark knight). Directors like Russo brothers are also great becoz they have made really great movies like The Winter Soldier, civil war, infinity war and endgame that's why they are the most successful director in this genre. I don't feel any other director who had achieved such greatness for their work like all of these. Toxicity can't beat superiority. That's it.", "Would have been better as a mini series": "It went on forever because they wanted to add the character depth to each character as you might get in a mini series or tv show. So, why not make it a mini series then? It went on for at least twice as long as it needed to tell its story.", "The SnyderVerse simply has to be restored!": "The JLSC was, simply put a work of art. To be able to bring the original vision to our screens is so fulfilling. Following The Justice League (2017), it was practically set in stone that DC had fell behind Marvel in its JL vs Avengers race and, despite siding with DC in regards to the franchise as a whole (comics and all), it was falling behind.However, the ability to turn the calamity that was the 2017 JL into the piece of art that it was is just astounding to me and hopefully the success convinces WB to stop interfering with a directors vision.The scene of Cyborgs introduction is absolutely fantastic considering the circumstances that there was nothing to preface it and the cinematography when he's in his mind's eye and helping the lady with her financial struggles as on first watching I didn't quite understand fully what was going on until the atm scene. The characterisation of Cyborg, considering his powers a curse rather than a gift, his grievances with his father was something astounding considering he had no stand-alone movie.The Flash improved ten-fold in this cut as well, and whilst he was one of the positives from the Josstice League, his character in the 2021 rendition was better refined. Humour was used more sparingly and in the right places and introducing the Speed of Light idea opened up the floor to a ocean of possibilities. Particularly the car crash scene, showed to me that this movie was an artist at work, a real visionary. The music to accompany it was beautiful and really set the scene, when compared to a similar scene from X-Men dubbed the 'Time in a bottle scene' showing how similar but also how different they are, but both are beautiful and show why we need more of our favourite speedsters on the big screen.Batman's employment in the JL was realistic considering the circumstances and the back-seat orchestrator role complemented Batfleck's characterisation nicely.Possibly summing up Zack Snyder's redemption of the JL was Jared Leto's redemption as the joker in one scene.In conclusion, it genuinely almost feels criminal that this saga won't get it's deserved conclusion.", "watched hardly 10mins before giving up": "This movie is a mess-- take my word for it. If you're a genuine movie aficionado and and expert of grasping the plot in the beginning by your experience, then you're highly likely gonna end up having it watched for not more than 10mins of it.

It fly's by\ud83d\ude0e", "The movie is Masterpiece": "This is the movie we deserve the movie gives an incredible experience and being 4 hours long is the best part of the movie. Go watch it on the HBO max.", "The Justice League film we deserve": "A unique and mature approach of a superhero glory. The film is loyal with the DC material combined with the director's top tier artistic prowess. Stunning visuals and eargasm soundscore. Definitely not the ordinary superhero film and easily the best comicbook movie of all time.", "Although it is not as good as Watchmen, it is one of the best superhero movies.": "This movie has clear and exciting storyline for every character, which is gearter than the version of Joss Whedon in 2017. Every chapter has amazing clip, I felt 4 hours not enough.", "Rating a 10 is for the hype": "Right off the bat this movie is 100% better then the 2017 version easily, I do think the 4 hours is to excessive, a 3hr 20 I think would have done the job, the visuals are great bar 1 or 2 painfully obvious green screen, the characters are given a lot more depth then before especially flash and cyborg have a lot more in the movie and the extra Amazonian scenes are also good.The story itself is more or less the same but the villain is handled so much better in looks and personality there is something there to work with, Batman is probably the stand out character for me and Ben did a great job, I would like to see his own movie but I'm also very excited for Pattinson's Batman next year.The movie is a stepping stone the DCEU really needed but isn't as good as people are praising it as one of the best superhero movies ever, it's simply not.The movie is decent and is a good 7 at most, worth a watch but don't fall for the hype as it isn't near it so go in hoping for a better version of what you saw and it will deliver.", "You're judging it wrong.": "The Justice league \"Snyder cut as it is called\" is a great movie. However the methodology for determining the success of the Snyder Cut seems to be somewhat rigged. That is only, my opinion after all but I draw my conclusion from a few factors. The Snyder Cut is a movie meant for the cinema, the big screen but viewed from the comfort of your home. Now with the revolution brought about by Netflix we have gotten used to viewing movies on Tv screens, Laptop screens and even phone screens at times although I feel that completely robs a movie of it's potential. Due to the success of Netflix mainly and other such streaming Platforms we have seen films which were made for the small screens, which were made to be relished from the comfort of your own home. The Snyder Cut was not such a movie, it's apparent to from the theatrics, from the sound effects, from the action sequences that such a movie is robbed of it's true potential when it is viewed from your Laptop screen. Would Avatar have been such a huge success had you watched it for the first time on your laptop screen? Consider Thor's entrance in Infinity war where he demolishes Thanos's army with his newly acquired storm breaker, would It really be a fan favourite scene without feeling the impact of amazing, powerful,thrilling sound effects and viewed on a laptop screen instead of a 100 ft tall cinema screen? Taking into account these factors, the success of the Snyder Cut is highly underrated, imagine a movie made for the big screen adjusted to the small screen and still winning at it, imagine it's true potential. Secondly, the expectations form it are just unfair to the movie. Somehow the Snyder Cut has been viewed as a beacon of hope by a loyal yet desperate fanbase. As if somehow one movie could magically fix everything wrong the on screen adaption of the DCEU. That's an unfair expectation from one movie, but the that being said the Snyder Cut is definitely a step in the right direction.That being established. The Snyder Cut does get a lot of things right; doing Wonder Woman the justice she really deserves. It can't be summarised into words, at least by me but WW really really got the justice she deserves, being the queen heroine of the DC universe. The simplest way to determine if someone had performed well for a super hero role? After watching them you just can't imagine another actor who could've been better for the role, they just seem to fit to the vision and WW definitely does so. Secondly, the Cyborg and Flash are much more prominent characters and not only side characters as unintentionally portrayed in the movie's predecessor. The addtional scenes really piece the movie together, the movie makes much more sense, the characters make much more sense, the additional screen time allotted to each character make for a much better viewing experience. Steppenwolf is given motive to attack Earth, a part which was completely missing from the theatrical cut of the film. The overall theme of the film is much more serious and \"dark\" a theme which does seem to go hand in hand with the path the DCEU has elected to go with. My ability to analyse and critique fails me in making any additional remarks without giving solid spoilers.If I were to make any recommendation it would be that the film definitely could've benefitted from some Hans Zimmer magic.", "It is Marvelous !!": "I wasn't expecting this kind of masterpiece. I had a smirk of joy on my face the whole movie. That says all about how much I enjoyed it. I hope to see Justice League 2 connected to this and directed by Zack Snyder the same way.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2019)": "I had the pleasure to watch Zack Snyder's Justice League on HBO Nordic on the 18th of March, 2021. To see that Zack Snyder got his vision made is incredible in itself. I must say that this is my favorite Zack Snyder film along with Man of Steel. Everything from the pacing, character development, score and story was really good. The 4 hours went by so fast, and it was really epic on its scale. This is the cut fans have been waiting for and the the cut they deserved. I loved how Ben Affleck's Batman wasn't a joke in this film opposite Josh Whedon's Justice League. He was the same Batman from Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. And I really loved how Ben Affleck portrayed the character in that film. And woah! Cyborg's story arc was so much better and well told. There were clearly many scenes that were cut from the theatrical version of the film. I am so happy to see that Ray Fischer got to be the heart and center of this film as he should be. Ezra Miller's Flash was also an absolute step up - no more 'brunch', thank you for that. Steppenwolf looks intimidating and badass. The CGI was for the most part really good, there are some scenes that could be better CGI-wise, but given the budget, I can definitely forgive that. I thought the whole cast did really well and their performances were good. The film had its moments where I almost got emotional - especially during the scenes where you get to know the characters of Cyborg and Barry Allen's better. I'd give this an 9 / 10. Thank you Zack Snyder for your vision. And for the fans, without the fans, this would not have been possible.", "Zack's Boring Movie...": "Wow!! I was hoping this was going to be better than the first version. It's 4 hours long because of all of the slow motion shots with horrible music. This is an artsy-fartsy superhero movie that we don't need. It just drags on and on. Some of the shots were cool, but they were few and couldn't compensate for all of the boring stuff. I wanted to fast forward through the movie. Makes the first version look better.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is better than the Josstice League": "Zack Snyder delivered one of the most action pacted movie and for 4 hours movie I thought I would be long and make me pause pause for at least 3 times for break but I loved the experience so much that I didn't want to pause so for Snyder's Fan as including me you are going to love it", "Can we have more?": "I've watched it twice it one day!! Can we have more? This is what we call the Art of Film Making... Zack Snyder you're the King Bravo.", "Terrible. Bloated. Same lame story.": "So much bloat. This could have easily been 2.5 hours if you cut all the unnecessary slomo and useless scenes.", "So it IS actually possible to make good DC movies": "I really do not understand how come people made such bad choices about basically everything about the Cinematic Universe. Now we have something we can start with. PLEASE KEEP THIS UP.\n-Barry's gestes were a bit too much. The way he runs doesn't also look like the flash'es one.\n-Cyborg's lines were mostly exaggerated. But the background story was depicted classy.\nThe rest was just good.\nLast two scenes basically gave goosebumps. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE CAST ANYMORE PLEASE", "That's more like DC": "It was an amazingly fantastically awesome movie!It was quite long, but it explained everything about all characters... And worth it all along!It was and had to be dark as such! Each character has got their value. It was not like quick look to everything.I personally I found that Joss Whedon did a decent job bringing this story to that one. That was a real difficult job to reduce 4 hours to 2 hours.But final words.... Worth the hype!", "Release the 16:9 cut": "I don't even care if it's better. The aspect ratio was too glaring to ignore", "Nice movie": "Great movie but in order to explain about the characters they really dragged the movie overall nice movie but it's 4 hrs which is a bit hard to watch", "Worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even last year.": "A very very bad wannabe of avengers. Too many things wrong with this movie to even list. Do yoga.. Or listen to radio.. Whatever.. Just don't waste your time with this movie.", "Keep Going Zack!": "To me it seams that Zack Snyder just keeps getting better. Man of Steel was very good. Batman vs Superman (The extended cut) was better. But Zack's Justice League has been the best of the bunch. What the studio did to Zack during the filming of this movie and then after the death of his daughter, is in my opinion is beyond wrong. Let him do movies on his terms, he knows what he is doing. I do support the Snyderverse, it is the best shot to perhaps even surpass Marvel.I am an extremely huge superhero fan, collecting over 25,000 comics over my life, worth more money than my house, and this is the best superhero film to date. Get the actors back, get the film crew back and most important get Zack back. FINISH THE SERIES!!!!", "Every second worth": "Not just a superhero movie, it was so much more than that, it was an emotional journey.", "WOW!": "That is the Justice we wanted, please continue the DC universe", "Snyder needs to make more DC movies": "This was perfect, it only proves that DCEU needs to be restored on the hands of snyder", "Much much much improvement from previous one.": "The first half couldn't be stretched enough. Maybe cause we have already seen this movie before, the creation of storyline of each character seems boring. But hang in there cause the fights are interesting and the second half is way better. Wanted to give it seven stars but increased one because of Ezra Miller.", "Unity": "This was so much better than theatrical cut. Writing was so better. Acting was also better. But in my opinion the direction was the best part of the movie.Cinematography was also amazing.Honestly the most important thing for me is when a director can show his vision. I love it when filmmakers win.The fan base saved the movie. Congrats to all.", "#RESTORETHESYNDERVERSE": "He isn't the hero we deserve, but the one we need right now. Zack Synder I tip my cap to you sir. This film is a success even after the endless struggle with WB, and the loss of his daughter. RIP Autumn. The story of the Justice League Zack tells alone is prodigious. To top it off Zack Snyders personal story behind the making of the film, well it's what stories are made of.", "Don't believe the 1 star reviews.": "I loved it. Dont know why anyone would hate someone's vision , i mean they can dislike it (with reason).People are it 1 star because length, aspect ratio and GVK review bombings.People who have problem with the length can watch it as a series because its divided in parts. They can watch 6-7 hours of a series, but will complain about the length of Snydercut.About aspect ratios, if u watch the film with focus the black bars will become innoticeable after some.Length and aspect ratio are just an excuse for Snyderhaters and Marvel toxic fans to give it 1 star. Many gave it 1star without any reason.Some people who are saying that snydercut fans are toxic bcuz they are giving GVK 1 star (which are now removed), are doing the same toxicity by giving 1 star to snydercut.", "The Justice League version that we needed!": "Soooo much better than the 2017 version! More character background, better storyline! New characters!!! Now I understand the flashbacks that left me so confused on the first version! Definetly worth watching!!!", "Painful to watch": "I cannot understand if I have become a grumpy old man in my 30s or the new generations of humans are terrible, because this movie does not come even close to all the tens it keeps getting.This movie has no dynamics. The story goes from one epic moment to another with huge cues of theatrical music. There is no character development. The special effects are terrible and inconsistent throughout the movie. The dialogue is unacceptable, the acting is terrible, and the only one that has genuinely portrayed his character was Jason Momoa.If you want to spend 4 hours on a quality feature, go watch the extended cut of Lord of The Rings; any installment would do. It took me 7 attempts to watch this one throughout because it's absolutely unbearable.", "Snyder's Magnus Opus - EPIC!!!": "I still quite remember the disappointment felt by me after watching the OG Justice League. When you gather such a great cast to play the roles of legendary superheroes, you go with an expectation of being treated with nothing short of epic cinematic experience. Joss Whedon's version failed to deliver that. But Snyder's version did deliver and more.It is a rare feat to produce a 4 hour movie, and even a rarer feat for viewers to sit through the same. ZSJL gives you the required motivation to sit through its entirety.Burning off slowly from the events of BvS, Bruce Wayne sets on the journey to assemble a group of metahumans to fight the impending threat to the Earth from alien invaders. We are given a glimpse of each hero's struggles and demons. The runtime of the movie grants each character's story to be bought to life and does not make the viewers feel that they are have been dropped randomly into the movie. Of all the new characters introduced, Cyborg's have been the most complete.Visually, ZSJL is a treat to watch. The colour tone of the movie has been set to give a grim/dark atmosphere. Plenty of slo-mo action scenes and beautifully choreographed actions scenes where each JL member takes the advantage of each other's move.The movie's epilogue serves as an extension of Snyder's Knightmare with surprising and delightful cameos.Every superhero lover should give this movie a try. This will be surely a unique experience for a long long time.", "BEST VERSION OF JUATICE LEAGUE.": "MORE ROLE OF CYBORG AND OTHER CHARACTER.DEEP INTENSE THEME.BUT SUPERMAN IS SHOWN TOOO MUCH POWERFUL HOPE DARKSIED VS SUPERMAN WILL BE A TOUGH ONE.", "WOW! How it should have been done!": "Warner brothers and Hollywood ought to learn from this lesson. Do it right, stop taking shortcuts for money. This version could have kept your brand from suffering. This was an amazing film. Thanks to the fans who brought this back from the dead! Thanks to WB who gave in and let this happen!", "ZS Justice League Reviewed...": "\"Zach Snyder's Justice League\" is an undeniable Improvement from the (2017) theatrical cut by \"Joss Whedon\". I admit it has its moments but unfortunately it was massively over hyped by the avidly defensive \"Snyder\" fans and \"Batfleck\" lovers who were going to rant and rave in victory about this 4hr cut regardless of the overall quality, plot and character development.\"Snyder's\" cut fails to be aesthetically pleasing, the aspect ratio and colour r grading did nothing but further differentiate it from its weaker predecessor. The CGI for \"Steppenwolf\" appeared better than the original granted but it's a far cry from decent, he was distracting and cartoonish, especially the mouth and eyes which are crucial for conveying the appropriate emotions so scenes can flow. \"District 9\" came out more than 10 years ago, the use of CGI for the aliens was and is still incredibly realistic. That was achieved with a fraction of the \"Snyder\" cut budget which is mind boggling. Some plot points and characters were well fleshed out but the last section seemed abruptly rushed in a desperate attempt to set up a sequel.It's not all bad though, some scenes work well and the redeeming factors mainly lie with the great cast performances. I don't believe this is what we would've seen if \"Zack Snyder\" was able to complete his original version back in (2017) but I'm glad he was given the opportunity to improve on his vision.", "EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH SUPERHERO MOVIES": "This film was all flash, all glitz, all special effects and all unbelievable and endless fight scenes. It also lasted FOREVER. In other words...perfect for 15 year old boys hopped up on energy drinks and bored stupid who need a release from endless video games and being shot down by unobtainable females.Watched it because of insomnia and didn't realise it would last OVER FOUR HOURS, but after an hour, wanted to see it through. This also seemed to be written by the population demographic it was aimed at.Forget science, forget physics, forget interpersonal dynamics and just 'suspend' all disbelief whilst watching it and you'll probably be OK.I have a couple questions:1) \u00bf When did Ben Affleck become so stupid and dull and was he on pain meds during the filming ?2) \u00bf Why is a seasoned, professional actor like Jeremy Irons associated with this awful crap ? If it was purely for the money, I have to say that he was the only thing about this film that I liked. and this is the only reason it even got two ( 2 ) stars outta' me. His Alfred was entirely believable and a breath of pure oxygen in what was otherwise a funeral pyre to all Superhero films.Of course, the only other matter was the obligatory WOKE insertions ( and intrusions ) into this 'experience'. So perfectly tiresome--but inescapable--at this point.This should be named 'Zack Snyder's INJUSTICE League'.", "Zack Snyder hattsofff": "..Bhai sahab ..I m from india ...Mainly I m a MCU fan .. but coz of ur direction nd vision m fan of DCU now... Love u .. god bless u zack", "Josstice League Begone!": "I gotta say that I am not a fan of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and the 2017 Justice League, but this feels like a huge step up! I'm still baffled, but also glad, that Warner Bros put forth the money to finalize the Snyder cut. You can tell that there's a lot more care here relative to the 2017 film.First of all, I'm fine with the great length of the movie. The chapters help give you that subtle reminder that you can just simply absorb this movie in chunks if you don't want to commit to that 4 hour runtime in one sitting.I appreciate and enjoyed the stretched out screen time and development we got for the Flash, Cyborg, and Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf felt competent and slightly more interesting. The brief dive into the lore of Darkseid and Apokolips was interesting and left me wanting more. I foresee the casual DC fan leaving kind of confused on a lot of the concepts looked at in this movie.One of the problems in this film is something that plagues the others, is the weak and cringe worthy dialogue at times. I found myself laughing at the movie when a character would say something that simply doesn't sound right. I still get annoyed with this type of cinematography! I found myself getting a headache at one point during the battle outside towards the end.Overall, I'm surprised that I liked it so much and it left me being curious to see where the Snyderverse goes next...", "Finally here is the original version": "I saw the first movie and I was so angry and dissapointed, but now we got a good movie. 4 hours is a bit long and sometimes boring but I liked the dark movement and yeah it was a great story with the main Justice League characters (except Green Lantern). See and enjoy, I give 7 points! I hope we will get more movies!", "An amazing and beautiful film": "An excellent movie overall, a masterpiece!

This movie exudes epicness through its entire runtime. We get to see all the heroes we know and love interact with each other and getting more depth as characters. Everyone has their time to shine and everyone was perfect. Cyborg's character is more fully fledged, Barry Allen is a scene stealer, Aquaman is cool as hell, Diana is truly an MVP and Batman excels as the leader of the team. Steppenwolf is a solid villain and Darkseid just blew me away. The host of secondary characters featured in the movie was perfectly balanced and managed to surprise me. The action is utterly epic. This movie has some moments that will make you get up you chair and scream \"daaaaaamn\". Of course, is not perfect. There are too many slow-motions and a lot of scenes are extended unnecessarily, which doesn't do any favors to the film's pacing.

Again they are better than Justice league but not up to par for a major Superhero movie.Just like in Justice League the villains are just bland and not menacing in the least, mostly because there really isn't much character development and they look like cartoon characters.The story was much better this time around. They really took their time giving our heroes backstories that gave us insight into their motivation to join the fight and become members of the Justice League, great character development.The movie was long at 4 hours but didn't feel like it.Also the epilogue was great, probably my favorite part of the movie with the dialogue between Batman and the Joker being epic.The movie still has its issues but if you're a fan of DC movies I highly recommend it.", "shows you can throw money at something and make it better": "I don't know if I like this because the other one was so bad or if this was actually good, I still think batman vs superman was awful and that was snyder so he is not this genius they are trying to make him out to be.I liked the long form of the movie, felt some scenes were not needed though. Snyder does wonder woman perfectly, everything about her in snyder films is cool. did not like the actor playing cyborg man or him in this, felt henry cavil was wasted in here, HC as a pure villian or red son superman would be excellent, affleck was affleck, still did not like jareds joker, that weird comment about a 'reacharound'.... wtf supposedly he ad libbed that, that dude cannot play the joker again. don't like lex luthors actor. not sold on the flash, felt the fast runner from x-men was better. not what you say but how you do it, that weird running style.... LOL\nBetter, but not on the level of a marvel movie.Still think X-men days of future past and logan are some of the best superhero movies ever.

The Flash may still be annoying, but he is funny sometimes, and he has two great themes, the action is top-notch and beautiful, from the Age of Heroes to the final battle to Flash saving the world. Every character at the very least is great and Batman and Superman are wonderful. The music is great (except for Wonder Woman's theme) and it accpomnanies the music PERFECTLY! Pretty much everything else is great too.This movie is not perfect though. It is four hours, can be boring, but that's about it. My 25th-fav film ever. This beats No Way Home in every way, any day.", "A superhero movie that connects": "This vision of the justice league has not only outdone the original, but is how this universe should be done.

He tried to give it that Marvel comedic touch. It didn't work, obviously. Bless Snyder for having the fortitude and guts to come back and finish it properly. I just can't quite get into the much darker tone of the DC universe, but I can see how they wanted to do it, specifically Snyder. I'd like to see it succeed, and would love to see the story carry on from this film. It's genuinely interesting. Man of Steel was done well, as was Wonder Woman. The Aquaman movie was just too overdone, but enjoyable. And again, the biggest surprise of these movies was the performance of Ben Afleck as Batman. Perhaps he'd consider coming back.

And those ppl who say that this is better than Endgame are kidding themselves, cuz Endgame was a deep beautiful and breathtaking movie and so memorable, while the only thing I took away from this film was that annoying WW song that was stuck in my head.. plus 4 hours is not needed.

Utterly arrogant to claim this is anything more than an extended version of the original.I'll start by complimenting the cinematography, which was certainly impressive. That is where my kindness ends. The plot was disjointed, and not engaging. The dialogue was laughable, the acting even worse. None of those involved appeared to have any on stream chemistry that you'd expect from a group trying to band together to save the world. Ben Affleck's attempt as Batman is a crime against humanity and reparations should be paid to us who have spent money on his films.Nothing about the acting, the plot, nor the dialogue gets you to invest in the characters' outcomes.Frankly I was cheering for the bad guys by the end in the hope that it could be the death of DC's current cast of heroes.", "I don't know what I just saw": "This movie is confusing as hell to someone not versed in DC universe. I'm so lost as to who is who and where anything and anyone are at most times.", "Still a lot of problems but a better ending.": "This story didn't need four hours and a lot of the issues from the cinematic release still remain. The cast manages to keep it together despite some very cheesy exposition. Much improved is the final act with a better plot layout. The threat feels more impactful. Still one too many characters and dull visuals are used as a substitute for actual grit. Hopefully Snyder's last DC project.

The knightmare scene much like the one in Batman v Superman has no place in the movie. It Is meaningless, and should have been cut. Fanboys will argue till they are blue in the face that Zach Snyder is an amazing director, and that this movie redeems him from all the other lame movies he has created.

Zack's version has a lot more action and more to the storyline it also brings the characters to better light and portrayed them far better.

I watched MOS the day before.It was my second watch, and yet here I sit with the end credits music playing and with a smile on my face.Every character, every actor shone. Iris, Lois and Martha. Every goddamned Amazon. MM. The ancient ones. The big six. The way these characters were portrayed resonated with me. This is Aquaman. This is Wonder Woman. This is what I envision what super powered people would really be like.Did you all notice that the Amazons all spoke like Diana/Gadot? The Wonder Woman movies made a half hearted attempt at this that mostly sounded Russian.The only character I missed from the previous movies was Christina Wren's Major Farris.Like a seven course meal, there's just so much to take in. The sheer brutality and abruptness of the combat. The long, meandering takes over breathtaking vistas. The attention to detail in the cinematography.Looking at the running time, I would wager that well over 50,000 frames are wallpaper-worthy.Zack, if perchance you see this in the sea of praise, have a thank you from Indonesia.", "Long, boring and some parts over dramatic": "I don't want to rant about everything wrong with this movie.

It's not a movie that can walk and chew gum at the same time. Combined with a 4 hour runtime, it makes the movie feel ponderous, in spite of the action set pieces.Affleck takes the prize for most emotionally constipated Batman. The Flash seems kind of ineffectual here, and is not helped by Wonder Woman and Superman coming off as so over-powered. The fight scenes, to me, feel cursory, as though the outcome is predetermined and everyone involved knows we're just going through the motions.That said, it's apparently not easy to make a DC movie where the heroes don't come off goofy/cheesy, so the movie succeeds on that level. And it is a relatively entertaining popcorn flick, if devoid of the emotional moments that elevate the best of the genre. Though it did feel a bit like it didn't know where to end.", "A new era for DC": "That is a real beginning of the new DC era.. a wonderful movie .. 4 hours of holding my breath and don't believe that such a movie has finally been created.\nI was a little unhappy with some simple similarities with the 2017 version in conversation.. like batman when he said that his powers is that he is reach .. it was the only good joke in 2017 version and I believe repeated such conversation was not cool.\nIt was so beavers to repeat a whole movie and admitting that 2017 was a disaster version.\nThank you", "Long Live Zack Snyder Long Live the Bat": "What a movie .

It is especially important since the Flash does not even have a movie about him!

I personally like the dark tone.Maybe there should be a #ReleaseTheSnyquel movement now...", "A perfect DC super hero film just WOW": "Probably one of the greatest movies ever made, i cant even find anything wrong with it, very dark, has swearing you get to see every character equally do their part, its just what you would expect from DC comic book movie now snyder makes \u00e0ll 3 of my favourite films, he is clearly a genius, he should go down in history as a legend, i actually liked this more than end game, watchmen is probably the greatest hero movie ever made, anyway just watch the snyder cut, even the ending is great its like a short movie, its actually amazing to be honest a very surprising addition, no spoilers \ud83d\ude09 i need to meet the legend snyder one day and give him some ideas my aspergers mind is a genius itself and i think i could pull off some director skills myself ;)", "A completely different movie.": "I'll just start with the fact that this version is superior to the theatrical release from 2017. However, there are some similarities between this and the Avengers. The fact that Steppenwolf is basically Loki and that Darkside is Thanos is just one example. Although these similarities are small, they did stand out for me. The introduction of some new characters and the brief appearance of old ones was helpful. Especially Lex Luthor, who was very toned down this time around and the scene with the Joker was also more likeable than the Suicide Squad version. On top of it all the visuals were rather decent given the overloaded CGI based scenes and characters. I feel that Snyder just wants to relive his 300 glory with all these saturated visuals but that seems to be his style so he can have it. Overall this movie was superior in everyway although I would not give it the blasphemously ridiculous 8.9 rating that some seem to think is fitting. I found that the film had a lot of unnecessary shots and prolonged sequences that I actually found unnerving. It was like writing a 2000 word essay in school and just BSing your way in between the important parts just to make it longer. The 4 hour runtime did not seem to bother me that much which is due to some excellent pacing but If the cut was at the 3 hour mark, I believe that the movie would have finished stronger.", "Magnum Opus.": "Zack Snyder-\n'well.., whaddya think...?'Stan Lee-\n'...Touche'.....'And I thought Sucker Punch would be his finest work.\nBoy, was I wrong.It took three years to get here, and the wait only made it the more sweeter.\nPlace your bets that (insert studio name here) will be kicking doors off hinges to be getting the ball rolling on part two.....\n\ud83c\udf44", "4 hours of closure": "Zack Snyder's Justice League feels like a breath of fresh air for DCEU.

I like how zack managed to introduce 3 new characters with enough character development in less shots. This is what we see if the production studios let the director to work on their true vision without interference. Finally this movie deserves a sequal, it has to because the movie ends with soo many cliffhangers.", "Better than the first": "This version improves on the original in almost every way. Even though it is 4 hours long, it's broken up into 6 parts for easy watching. The characters are more developed in this version and you understand their motivations better. Having said that, there are some things I didn't really get. The Amazonian parts all felt cheesy and I think they spent too much time on them. Also, what is up with the F-words in this movie? They don't fit at all. I don't know what they were thinking doing that. All in all though it's a solid film.", "A different film": "First off I'm no rabid fan, but this cut is outstanding, it explains a lot of the back stories, gives context and four hours goes by quite quickly.There is a huge difference to the cinema version, it is the film DC deserved.Broken up into acts, so if a break is required it is easy to do without loosing the story line.By far the best DC movie since Watchmen!", "What a waste of money.": "Just as stupid as Avengers but with less color. Characters with the depth of a puddle of water and dialog made by a 12 year old boy. But then again. Maybe it's written and made for people in their early teens.", "Worse Than the First Try.": "While padding the original released movie out to four hours does allow for more characterization, it was already severely lacking on that front and has only moved from terrible to less terrible.However, while they technically are developed more, that does not mean it's all for the better. Characters are more murderous just for the sake of Snyder's insatiable desire for brutalizing humans on screen. While brutality can be entertaining, it is at the cost of turning supposed heroes into barbarians, despite them already being established to be better than this.Visuals have improved since the first attempt, yet shrunken down into an aspect ratio I can only surmise is to make the film seem more artistic than Snyder taking his action figures and slamming them tigether. It makes things seem only more obnoxious and oblivious, at least to me. Coupled with shots that are drawn out to degrees that should make any viewer question if this needed to be as long as it is; the opening sequence one of said scenes that goes on unbearably long while also being one of the most ridiculous, goofy looking and plotted scenes in cinema.The only point of this film is painfully obvious; to appease those who felt Whedon corrupted Snyder's vision, despite him having little time to change much of the already completed script and mostly shot acting. This is also aside from some of the biggest grievances also appearing in the traikers, before Whedon was brought in. Aside from this, the other purpose was to plead for more movies by providing absurd, out of left field footage of an entirely different movie that will never be as one of the ending scenes, devoid of context but just enough to spoil most of any future premises, in order to entice a rabid fanbase of which the film is undeserving.More watchable than Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad (the original) or Wonder Woman 1984 in terms of entertainment value, it still joins the ranks of DC Snyder films to watch just to be able to criticize it for fun in conversations from time to time.", "Really wanted to love this one": "But i can't. I was really hyped for the Snyder cut, maybe it's just me but it couldn't live up to my expectations.\nFirst of all aspect ratio, i'm aware about vertical shots and artistic vision and i also know we've talked about this enough already. But i just couldnt get used to it even after 2 hours. In my opinion Zack should've went atleast for the original idea, which was 1,66:1.We have some super corny and cringeworthy dialogs, especially in the beginning. Wonder Woman responses are almost on Robot level.\nNormally i like Snyder's Slow Motion stuff (like in 300), but in this movie it feels literally like a slow-mo overdose on steroids.This movie is still far superior to the original 2017 version though. But i also believe it is way too overhyped because of the current cinema situation.\nIt is just the 2017 version with a lot of bonus footage, \"fan service\" i guess.", "A must watch superhero movie": "As some scenes of this movie were already seen earlier it might not look to be thrilling.

Even if it has minor flaws, it has an enormous potential. The cast is great and already had their standalone movies or about to have like Ezra who is a very talented actor. Plus, I knew Ray from True Detective s3 where he was not a lead but he literally showed an enormous performance in here. As I always say, I hope studios begin to trust the visions of the directors at the first place and for Zack, glad he got his chance in here. Whether you don't like his perspective in cinema it is undeniable that he has a great artistic vision. I for example, not found of his take of Watchmen and really struggled (could be because of my familiarity with DC universe as well) yet, in here I saw myself actually invested in both leagues, and Steppenwolf's story. And, to keep audience in the story for 4 hours is also a great job even if it is streaming. Not much to say, #RestoreTheSnyderVerse for real. It has genuinely a good opportunity for future films and cast. You cant just ignore this opportunity when you have likes of Henry or Ben even Ray who was teally the MVP of this movie. It does not even need to copy Marvel (which just a big fan service), DC always thrived when it is radical, and serious. It can find its harmony when its disagreements fixed.", "Good movie better then original": "Good movie I enjoyed it , wish we got a standalone Ben Affleck Batman movie\ud83e\udd23.

This was everything we could have hoped for and more.", "Better, but still flawed": "A definitive improvement over the terrible cinematic cut. Many bad backstories are fixed, villains make some sense, but many issues persist while new ones arise.Barry's moment and the world ending is epic and really made me think of Endgame rather than the shallow stories of whatever Whedon ever made. The characters and their actions actually made sense and some awesome side-stories with Batman's visions or Darkseid really make me want to see more of what Snyder attempted to do with the DCU.But c'mon, the movie doesn't have to be 4 hours. The whole time the movie tries to keep epic music going, build deep backstories and pump either dark or epic slow-mo moments into every scene... After a while it just gets tiring to see slow explosions and the comedic or less dramatic moments felt really weird when placed into this theme.DC also has major disadvantages over the MCU because the characters and their movies are just shallow and fairly underwhelming. There's also some terrible power imbalance and while the Snyder cut fixes many issues, there's just no way it can get over this. DC is much more built towards the Joker/Batman dark but non-superhero stories from Gotham than these MCU-like crossovers.", "An amazing movie which also improves Batman V Superman": "I loved every minute of this film when I watched it when it came out. I went and rewatched Batman V Superman Ultimate Edition after and both of these films fit perfectly together. The 4 hours are so worth it.

All we need now is the Ayer Cut for Suicide Squad.", "Pop culture history in the making!": "I never thought I would say that, but a hashtag brought justice to a movie that was released only half and broken four years ago. All these years I thought #releasethesnydercut was a hoax, I was proven wrong and the power of the fans taught a lesson to the studios. Gave us entertainment at very grim times. Well done Zack! #restoresnyderverse #forautomn.", "Better, Longer, Less Cut, But....": "These views are my own, if you don't agree that is cool. Overall, I liked it much more than the original theatrical release. Made much more sense.I watched this directly after rewatching the original so I could compare the two. What was interesting was how much Joss Whedon left in. Most who talk about the original will discuss it like he added in 70%+ new footage and ignored the original. That isn't true. A lot of the original release is Zach Snyder content, just with a lot left out. On the flipside, there are parts of Whedon's version that was reshot for literally no reason, showing conversations happening from a slightly different angle or location, but were already in the movie to start with. However, overall, the beats and plot points of the movie remain the same, so it was clearly storyboarded fully.\n***Now The Spoilers***The upsides;\nThe motivation for Steppenwolf was a lot clearer in this version. We learn that the original fight fought by all the tribes was with Darkseid, not Steppenwolf, which adds a bigger element to the story.\nBarry Allen is slightly dialled down in this. Still goofy, but we thankfully lose the awful \"It's like a Bat Cave\" line that was in the original. I can get behind a solo movie for this Barry.\nNo bickering and full on disagreement between the members that made them feel disjointed previously.\nBruce doesn't brood as much about letting Superman down. I mean he does, but not quite as much.\nWe lost the scenes of Diana doubting herself as a leader, which made no sense for a woman who had left her island to fight with man to destroy a God.\nMore time gave the whole thing more clarity.\nMartian Manhunter.The downsides;\nSlightly too long. There were the odd scenes that could have stayed out, such as the scenes with Steppenwolf checking in after each box he found. The first one was fine as it showed his motivation, but beyond that it just dragged the pace. Likewise, the epilogue could have been cut down. Bruce's dream/premonition could have been left for another movie. It isn't necessary here.\nTitle cards (Part 1, etc). I know the reasons why they were there, but if you are putting it all into one continuous film, leave them out. It's only necessary for a change of character like in Kill Bill.\nWe do lose the Aquaman-sitting-on-the-lasso-of-truth scene. It's not actually an issue, I just personally liked it.As I say, I liked it more than the original. My only personal criticism is that this was hyped so much I expected almost an entirely different film. And while it is, it also isn't.", "Superhero Masterpiece!!!": "This film is a masterpiece of the superhero genre, equal to that of the scale and depth of Lord of the Rings.

But you know what this is even better than what I expected and totally epic. Although so many leaks and so many trailers showed almost the whole movie, none of these didn't make the movie boring and feel like you know every stuff. And Junkie XL's score totally fits the movie and makes the movie even better.", "It's monumental. It's maddening. It's art.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a 4 hour epic, director's cut split into six chapters. The movie is presented in 4:3 aspect ratio in order to preserve the creative integrity of the director's vision. It contains zero Whedon footage and feels like a completely different experience.\nThe movie is slow burning for the first half. Zack Snyder takes us to this journey of mythic characters from the DC universe that is rich in character development, full of parallels to 'The Lord of the Rings'. According to Zack Snyder himself, the movie clearly draws inspiration from 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy and 'Seven Samurai' which would encourage the black and white version of the movie in the future. Every character has a purpose in the story now, even the villains. They actually feel like a threat. All league members play a vital role. The movie dives deeper into characters like Cyborg and Flash. This time their performance really came through as they got sufficient screen time. The outcome hasn't changed in the movie but the events play out differently. Steppenwolf has had a huge update. He now has a solid motivation and a sick armor to rock with.\nFor a director's cut, the length isn't much of an issue, as the pacing is smooth. As Zack mentioned, shorter version of the movie exists which were optimal for theatrical releases. The movie doesn't really feel long, but rather makes you want for more. Zack Snyder proves that you don't need a 20 movie franchise to make a Superhero team-up movie. His approach is different and it works. His vision revolves around and Superman's journey. The league is here to support him.\nThe tone and color grading looks a lot better this time. Although the CGI is slightly rough in a few places, you won't notice it amidst this overwhelming story and performance of the actors. The music and score is really well done but feels overused in some cases.\nThe movie showcases Snyder's decadent and voluptuous idea of what superhero mythmaking should be. Similar to his previous works. With outstanding writing, exhilarating music and divine direction, Zack Snyder's Justice League is monumental. It's maddening. It's art.", "Decent I Suppose": "Loved that we for more Affleck Batman time, but the truth is it was pretty boring and dull with far too many characters and far too simple a story to stretch over 4 hours. Plus way too much CGI. But the biggest problem of the film was that there wasn't enough Superman. I certainly hope we get another full Henry Cavrill Superman movie.", "We expected more": "Honestly Darkseid should have been featured more for all those 4 hours. Really didn't meet my expectations. But for Zack's exit , he really outdid himself In directing that movie .", "Blew away all expectations!": "Miles better than the theatrical. It's everything I wanted and more from a live action Justice League movie! Give Zach the chance to make more!!!", "Absolute Best of the Best...\u2764": "This movie is so perfect ... Everything literally is so beautiful the score, cinematography, direction, writing....\nThe thing I like not every character is cracking unessary jokes ...I hate That...\nThis is true Justice League movie we always wish for...Can't wait for the JL2 and JL3 and so More...!", "Truly a Masterpiece.": "Amazing movie. It takes you to a completely new world of superheroes. It's my 1st movie that i watched on streaming service. Waiting for 4 years for this masterpiece. Zacks vision and and way of story telling is simply awesome. Waiting for the sequels. #ReatoreTheSnyderverse.", "Marvelous Oustanding Masterpiece": "This is it. This is what we as fans of DC deserve to watch. For me this was a great reset for the whole universe of DC. Excellent origin stories , I didn't even feel how 4 hours passed. The way Snyder remade this is perfect. I am so hyped for what may come after this one. One thing is clear , DC is back in the game for sure!", "Long... but not bad!": "So just spent 4 hours watching Synders Justice League.. my god was that long!!!Overall good movie however I guess it's been spoiled as I have previously seen the first movie so you kinda know what's going to happen.. although there is new footage in this movie, did all of it need to be added?? Some bits were good some just should have been cut!I guess my only thing I felt after watching this movie was.. why did it need to take 4 hours to make a movie where as the Avengers movie did it in 3 hours?? Not only did they do a shorter movie the characters seemed more closer more in tune with each other!Would I watch this again?? No I don't think I would it's just too long..Still however, compared to the previous one and Batman V Superman it's definitely a much better version", "Well what can I say": "It's light years ahead of the theatrical release. So many things fleshed out. All the \"he wanted to do this, and this, and this \" BS is gone. You get the mind blowing ending. The mind blowing epilogue. a lot of overdone glam group shots. But the guy was making a statement. Basically, look at the beautiful thing I was doing and they butchered it.REALLY, REALLY liked it!", "Erring is human, forgiving is divine and rectifying is wise": "Look, I'm a comic fan but not an expert ubernerd ready to jump at the slightest inconsistency or deviation from the source material; granted, this was never going to meet the overhyped expectations of comic connoseurs, nor was ever going to please the foster-scorsese film purists who despise comic movies and just dismiss them as cheap entertainment for simpletons beneath their majestic aura of indie story telling saviours. The thing is, this re-editing opens up a whole new wonderous box of possibilities and course correcting where dc stops trying to measure size against marvel and does its own thing, which was always supposed to be darker, more cinical, less color saturated and perhaps more self deprecating. It gives a true purpose to Flashpoint if they choose to follow this thread but most of all, it gives warner the chance to differenciate their cinematic universe once and for all. Snyder is forcing their hand like ryan reynolds forced fox's when he leaked deadpool camera tests online to get fan support and ultimately a definitive bargaining chip, so the ball is on their roof as they say. If the 4:3 aspect ratio is your biggest beef with it, your loss. I for one, am willing to undergo an exercise of selective memory loss and recalibration, scrapping the original version plus aquaman and wwii and look to the future, which looks exciting if the guys in suits back off and listen to the masses, read a few blogs, chill out on political correctness and pg-13 and let a few true fan creators take the reins. Just a humble opinion", "A COMPLETE MASTERPIECE": "Well, hours of a movie and couldn't find a single moment where I could criticize a scene, A complete movie and definitely Snyder's masterpiece... I'm not a hater of Marvel's and bringing no comparison but this is better than anything possible...\nAgain this movie is \"JUSTICE LEAGUE\" unlike the previous \"Superman & 5 side heroes\"...", "He just made it slower. . .": "Adding more doesn't a better movie make. Bunch of super dc fans up in here. I'm not partial to either marvel or dc but this movie was rather boring the first time and didn't really change much for this edit.", "Here's to hoping for Part 2": "Honestly, Zack's version of Justice League feels like a huge refresh of the potential that the DC universe has, and I hope that Warner Bros and HBO see this. I was shocked with how much I loved the movie. Within the first 10 minutes, you can tell that this is a completely different movie than the crap box we got in 2017. There's so many beautiful shots and effects, and each character really gets the screen time they deserve. There's little hints and Easter eggs for all fans of the Justice League. Even if you aren't a huge fan or were turned off by the 2017 version, I would highly recommend the 4-hour watch.", "Masterpiece 15 out 15!!\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e": "I have only one word after watching 10 times !#restorethesnyderverse.", "The justice league we deserved in 2017!": "The difference between DC and Marvel is the tone and the characters. DC characters are of higher ideals. The full potential of the person. The gods amongst men. The best of us. DC is about the greater good, the conflict of the self in the face of insurmountable odds.Zack Synder captured the essence of what the Justice League is and how they react in the face of the enemy. In four hours we got to see the characters in full especially Cyborg, Batman, and Flash. We got to see what motivates them, what drives them and what brings them together and in the end forging a team that looks out for each other.The strongest aspect of this move was Steppenwolf. Superhero movies are only as good as the villain. Unlike the theatrical version, Steppenwolf became a 3D character with a goal for redemption and we got see how he works to find the mother boxes. He was menacing, dangerous, relentless, determined. And his look was so much more commanding and had an presence that was undeniable.I want to give this 10/10 but really I would give it 7.5/10 because of incongruent pacing of the story. It isn't hard to follow but slows down and picks up in a very random way that can sometimes pull one out of the story. I also was disappointed that there wasn't a flashback to Steppenwolf's exile from Apokolips. This would have been a fantastic 20mins of additional action and world-building for the characters.This movie is long, but not without reason. There is a balance of action, drama, and exposition. Fantastic vision of DC brought to you from the mind of Zack Snyder.", "Good and an improvement but...": "A 7 might seen low to some but I Will first off say that I am not the biggest Snyder fan. but this is the best Snyder movie in the dceu tho. It had lots of great moments and improved on almost everything the original did. However I think this movie could have been around 3.5 hours while not sacificing anything important. And some parts of this movie just don't seem finished like Batman's voice moderator sometimes it workes and other times you just hear Ben doing a deep voice or award running with the flash. The movie also had some weard music. But overall I think it's worth watching if you already have HBO MAX and are interested.", "Brilliant Film!! Surprised by how different it was to 2017.": "I've just got done watching this and it's absolutely brilliant!! It's so good I have just put the 2017 DVD in the bin (I got it just to add it to the collection but it was still in the wrapping) If you are a comic book fan then get in front of the TV and watch this.", "Visual Feast that FLIES BY!": "This movie was excellent. The larger story and character motivations all make sense now. It's incredible how the same footage can look so different depending on the directors vision. I would love to see this in IMAX. At no point did I feel like the movie dragged and the whole thing just flew by. Highly recommend.", "Well, it still can not compete with the Avengers": "The Problem is, the Watchman were Snyders comic-hero masterpiece. This one it is not. Mostly because Darkseid is not as cool as Thanos.", "Absolutely amazing!": "The film is what we shoukdnhabe got back in 2017, it confuses me how Warner bros looked at this and went \"nah we are going with wheedon version\" Zack snyders cut is one of the best comic book films ever made, A true masterpiece. Time to restore the snyder verse", "The Lord of the Rings for Superheroes": "I don't think I've ever seen a superhero movie with that much ambition. We've been used to the soapy corny soup that Marvel has served us for years but finally we get a superhero movie that goes beyond the conventions. The tone and the philosophical aspects explored in this movie remains what makes it really interesting and worth of attention. Furthermore, the backstory of Darkseid and his fight against Earth's original heroes finds its place among the best scenes I've seen in a blockbuster since the Lord of the Rings. Thank you Zack Snyder. Hopefully Warner will swallow their pride and offer us sequels to this masterpiece.", "Hypest DC film I have ever seen!": "Starts off with a bang, and continues on from there never dropping a beat for the entire 4 hours. Made me cheer, gasp, clap, tear up and everything else. The music was beautiful and complimented the way this film looked. Every character was redeemed from previous iterations. Actually had funny jokes this time around. 10/10 will be watching a few more times this weekend!!", "Geez that was long....Worth it though....": "Yeh, you definitely need the contrast of bleak and upbeat playing off each other. In this day and age a much greater range of emotions evoked needs to be explored otherwise the movie just comes off too one-dimensional as was done with the \"other\" Justice League. I guess \"good on everyone involved\" for putting this one together to at least set a decent precedent for future efforts.", "Why was it not the original": "This is the way a superhero movie should be made. Still wondering why it was not the original cut.\nDetailed movie with amazing cuts...\nloved it", "The most Epic Superhero movie since Infinity War": "Zack Snyder finally did it. He gave us the Justice League we always wanted on screen and its glorious. Action Scene are much improved as well as the plot of the movie. The villains are menacing and actually threaten the Earth. Characters are more fleshed out thanks to the long run time and now we care if they succeed in saving the earth. Some flaws might be the slow pacing but i didn't mind it at all. I will give it 10/10 just to reiterate how good this movie is. MUST WATCH", "Dissapointing. A waste of time.": "Unnecessary long, a lot of open questions. Not enough details. Too sentimental... DC movies keep dissapointing. The script is terribly written.", "A Must Watch ... Epic": "That's a true Batman / Superman movie for those who love it ... a perfect scenario and direction for all movie scenes, I didn't feel 4 hours till it was all over .. never bored for 1 second and can't wait till Warner move on and show us what's hidden in JL2/3.", "Can't believe I'm the only one to acknowledge how bad this film is!": "I saw the original in the cinema. Heard so much hype about this movie, but I still wasted part of my life. You clearly can't polish a t***. It just doesn't make sense. Awful storyline and dialogue. I just wanted to see superman resurrected... then I was done. 4hrs of what?! Worst movie this decade.", "Green screen epic": "Green screen, cgi, and dialogue that would have made shakespeare proud, seems to define this movie.Im a big fan of the drama and character arcs in the dark knight trilogy, and latest joker, so to see this one go in a complete opposite direction and trying to be epic before anything else dissapointed me big time.Please introduce bad guys with more backstory and motive other than just being bad for being bad. I was rather dissapointed.", "There's a decent 2.5 hr movie in here somewhere": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is needlessly bloated with redundant scenes and slow motion footage. I'm pretty confident the only reason half of it made it into the final cut is because they spent time filming it and it looked good. The story itself was interesting and every character felt fleshed out.Zack Snyder started making this movie, the first in his Justice League trilogy and a sequel to \"Batman v Superman\" and \"Man of Steel,\" but was unable to finish it due to issues in his personal life. Joss Whedon took over as a director and made something apparently worse than this. I haven't seen it, but if that's true, it could probably be used as a torture device. Zack Snyder came back to finish his work and correct the mistakes made by Whedon with this film.This film features a grand total of five seconds of footage of a half eaten hamburger. Five seconds of slow motion footage dedicated entirely to a half eaten hamburger. Nothing else is visible. It's a half eaten hamburger on the floor of a truck. How did that make it in the final cut? Was nothing else in the scene more important than that? Really you could cut the whole scene because Barry's struggle in his professional life is already covered by the conversations with Bruce and with his dad, and his love life never comes up again.Why was Martian Manhunter in this at all? I understand including him in a quick cameo appearance, but having him go visit Lois while looking like Martha felt a little unnecessary. On a similar note, most of Lois' screen time was dedicated to her looking sad and visiting Superman's grave. You can cut half of that out and not lose anything.I really enjoyed cyborg's backstory, but why is there so much exposition for him? We don't need three separate slow motion shots of him scoring a touch down. The exact details of his ability to control the stock market doesn't come up again. They could've said he can manipulate it then immediately show him giving the money to a nurse, someone we all know is hardworking, and then move on. I'd include more examples, but I don't want to bore you.I have similar complaints about Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Most of Batman's scenes are used to advance the story. Superman is the only character that was on screen for the perfect amount of time.Nearly every shot looks fantastic, but Zack Snyder's overuse of slow motion and inclusion of pointless scenes and shots makes this one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.", "So now this is. the Zack Snyder Cut, huh": "This has been a highly anticipated movie.\nLet's start with the obvious: It is a very long movie.\nAnd it is a confusing one.I still don't like the parademons. And the problem is, that their strength is widely inconsistent.\nYeah - inconsistency is a big deal - that is a typical issue in superhuman (...) movies, and also very apparent here! It is unquestionable unreasonable, how overpowered Superman is. Wonderwoman? Sometimes incredible strong - sometimes quite weak, sometimes superhumanly fast and sometimes just quite normal.\nThe Flash - well he is fast. Unfortunately it is again the stupid nonsense-fiction stuff, with faster than light movement. argh... and some jokes of him are cute, but overall he could have been just more nerdy. Common the actor doesn't really embrace neediness!Steppenwolf has the same issues. Normally extremely strong - but then not that strong. He had no issues to fight all of our superhero friends - but then faulted with Superman - strangely enough Superman fought with the same group and well did better yet, wasn't so overpowered as in the fight with Steppenwolf. Well maybe the tete a tete with Louis was helping and his sun bath? Who knows.Aquaman is probably the biggest disappointment. Even under water he just sucked. He is cool - but this is all. His \"semi flight\" when propelled by Cyborg is really totally nonsense (well this didn't changed much compared to the original movie).So yeah - a lot of nonsense. I think this is the problem of Zack Snyder - if you have got a more somber tone, you also have to look at more reasonable powersets of your characters.So is the movie good? Well - it is entertaining. The last act is just setting up the next (never to be produced?) movie. It is again confusing - Batman dream sequence (is it an omen or not? If it is not something which will happen in the future, it is totally a waste of time - but if it is connected with the future, it is unclear, how this works...).I mean - the preamble that Superman turns dark because Louis Lane dies is a pretty thrilling story line. But do we really want to see this? Did we not have enough of Batman v Superman and Justice League (when Superman just didn't yet remembered)? Oh yeah - last \"bracket\" was also a bit clunky... Superman attacks the superheroes just because... (well Cyborg shoots first... but hey). So is Superman unhinged? Did Batman was right to begin with?Is it anywhere near as good as the Avengers movies? No. It isn't really the dark gritty and violent tone of Zack Snyder. I actually like this style. But as mentioned before, Snyder has just simply restraint himself. It is just lazy writing, if heroes and villains consistently change their power levels (and weaknesses).Batman is the best example how problematic the inconsistency is: even though Batman is well trained, he won't be stronger than any very strong human (he is actually human...). So he is able to fight with parademons and is able to kill some.\nAt this power level, the superheroes should not have any issues to defeat any number of parademons (I mean The Flash is able to reach light speed... Wonderwoman is super strong and is far faster than a bullet etc.). Still they are fighting lengthy with the demons. This is unreasonable. It is basically having a fight with... kittens.Also a good question: why are the Green Lanterns not there to help? Are they as embarrassed as Ryan Reynolds about the last movie?Too many questions. I believe, that directors have to dial back. Superhero films are different than comics. And the movies are no more longer for teens, which are not interested in common sense physics. I feel superhero fatigue - and this is not because there are too many movies (well maybe), but because it is all about spectacle but on the other side, the movies are insulting your intelligence. Really!", "Finally justice done to the justice league": "Finally justice being served the to the justice league. This movie is way way ahead of the previous version of justice league we had saw. We all need a second part of this film.", "8.4?? What About Watchmen??": "I'm sure we've all heard about the legend of the production of this movie, and the tragedy that Zach Snyder had to experience, so I'm just gonna talk about the movie as an audience instead of a fan. This version of Justice League presents more about each characters and their development through the battle with Steppenwolf, especially Cyborg and the Flash. Also the easters eggs in the film, including the entrance of Martian Manhunter and Dark Seid are even more exciting as we get to finally step into the expansion of DCEU. However, the movie seems more like a extended version of the 2017 Justice League, with more unnecessary slow motions and explanatory dialogues that simply guide us through the plot we already known. The main storyline is the same, except for an extra 3 hours of ornamentation, which makes the movie suuuuuper sloooow. DCEU needs more than just effects and soulless superheroes defending the world without purpose.", "Totally satisfied": "Thanks to Zach Snyder. Am really really satisfied watching this 4 hours film and I may watch it multiple times. The Flash scenes are really well made in this film unlike the 2017 and introduction of Martian Manhunter to DC universe is pretty much awesome. Only sad that the film's aspect ratio is not wide-length, however totally loved the film.", "boring and shallow": "Marvel wiped the floor with you, give up already. You even managed to ruin joker for me.", "Better than 2017's, but it's a hard 6": "Mediocre, far too long, exposition fest. But by comparison with the theatrical release, it's freaking Citizen Kane", "Release the snyder verse.": "The best comic book movie ever made. Epic. Snyder has to be restored.", "Masterpiece !!!!": "Everything is so perfect about this movie!\nWell done Zack", "Zack Snyder saved the DC franchise": "I nevwr expected that this movie will be so good. Story build up is awesome. Sound score behind a fight is well maintained that you hairs will stand when you watch this movie. It deserved a well theatrical release.", "Lives up to hype": "I'm a fan of MOS (my favorite CB movie) and BVS, especially the ultimate edition. So I expected something very good, certainly better than the theatrical release, which I liked as a similar movie to Marvel's phase one..a fun popcorn flick but with flaws. This is on an entirely different level. It's a serious, sweeping epic. Like all movies, there are some flaws that stand out, but the pluses outweigh the few negatives. I'm not getting into the details but just wanted to add my voice to those who are rightly saying Snyder succeeded and should be given the opportunity to complete his future vision for this franchise. I'm hopeful he is and\nExcited if he does!", "Only One Question?": "Who were the geniuses who thought of not releasing this version. Why wasnt was this realeased earlier. This just version simply proves why DC is always >", "Not worth watching unfortunately": "I am a huge Zach Snyder fan. I loved most of his movies but this is different. Don't watch the movie. It's a fail. It's basically an emotionally, 4hr-overdrawn patch-job of an originally badly executed CGI mess with not enough new content...all so that Zach Snyder could satisfy his emotional needy artistic nature for his original vision which got disrupted by some \"family tragedy\" and years later the public is supposed to act as if it was good enough? It's basically the same movie, emotionally, cinematographically, plot-wise, etc....\nThe positives are the following: the original was worse. But that's like comparing a 3 with a 4 out of 10. Also, anything Christopher Nolan touches improves so thank goodness he was included here.\nI look forward to another Superman based Zach Snyder movie that will be complete in its vision, craftmanship, and delivery...like Batman vs Superman was or Man of Steel.", "Worth 4 hours watching": "It was a great improvement from the released version several years ago. It was a joy to watch and much more in depth gritty take winding the net for potential film spin offs. It was nice to see more of the back stories from some of the characters as the released version kinda just had the characters appear and get recruited and fight. The way the story is put together shows how and why each character ends up where they do and that feeds into how the characters come together which was missing from the released version", "JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE": "Finally we get to see a story where we are able to relate to the characters and their storyline\nfinally a back story of the villian\nand there was more to learn about steppenwolf than just his name\ngiving flash and cyborg their moments\njust like marvel hyped us about thanos in their initial avenger movie, zack did the same with darkseid\nin short a masterpiece by zack", "Restore the synder cut": "This movie is so much better than 2017 . There's some weird parts like the singing whenever Wonder woman appeared but it amazing eventho that story makes so much more sense and complete it's true could have been shorted but their was no point for that since it going in a theater but on a stream service which is perfect.", "Absolutely EPIC!": "This is the best superhero movie ever. Thank you,Mr. Zack Snyder !!!", "Not an improvement over the animated version; equally 2 dimensional.": "First of all, it was four hours long, largely due to the combination of slow motion overuse, and of a long ramp-up of the narrative. Perhaps, for the idle minds of COVID-19 confinement, four hours entertained is better than 2 (for children).However, it seems that this is a recasting of a previous version i.e. There is nothing new in terms of plot. However, there is so much reliance on (excellent) CGI, that there was almost no point in using actors who had narratives that were as predictable and 2 dimensional than the animated versions.It was very much \"been there, done that\". What is obvious is that Ben Affleck, and Henry Cavill are getting outside of the age range. Physically, they were all \"cartoonishly\" attractive, but yet another glower and strut by Jason Monmoa, another terse, taciturn utterance from Ben Affleck whose Batman mask doesn't detract much from the facial expressiveness bare faced, and the amazingly even toned Gal Gadot, who seems to parade around in a suit that seems to belong in another pre-feminist era, and miraculously keep her makeup, hair and skin flawless, are just infantile.The actor playing the Flash as an insecure, campy person is \"different\" but no one explains that his super speed also comes with unbreakable body, when he is diverted from his supersonic track and slammed into a wall at G-force 50?So, overall, a 6. Entertaining if you are a child, or child-like, for \"superheros\", and haven't seen the plot before (or forgot it; there are so many superhero-multiverses to keep track), it's gorgeous visually, but the character development, originality of narrative, and tone are inferior.", "A Filmmaking lesson": "It truly showed the potential in the Snyderverse, elaborated quite a lot on the BvS movie plot, and left fans craving much much more. This movie's tone and pacing is much more consistent with its storyline, it simply feels coherent. Whether or not WB ends up ever moving forward with Zack's vision is irrelevant, this movie will forever be a monument in the DC Comics storytelling history. Comparing this movie with 2017 one is nothing short of a lesson or an entire course in filmmaking.", "Absolute masterpiece": "This is the Justice league we should have had all along. Cant even describe how good it was. Blown away", "The Justice Is Served": "Well if you feel useless remember someone at WB allowed Josstice League instead of Zack Snyder's Justice League which is easily the best CBM in my opinion.", "Ma man": "I really love it !

Wake up Warner Bros", "best directors cut ever": "Producers cut 6/10\ndirectors cut 10/10In a world of producers vs artists this is a clear example of how polotics ruins everything.", "The Justice League that should have been": "This is what it should have been. There were a couple parts that may have not needed to be in there but overall a great film. It's long so prepare.", "O.K. But not markedly better than the first version": "For a while D. C. movies have tried to imitate the Marvel style of action and humor and it never quite worked (they where better back in the days of the Dark Knight and the first Henry Cavill Superman, which showed when the D. C. universe fell in a heap after the first version of Justice league and the rather weak Wonder Woman 1984 after the quite good first Wonder Woman. This also lead to Superman (Henry Cavill) being let go, odd given he is probably the best Superman to date.The first version of Justice League was a pretty average film and frankly I see little change in this new extended version, putting some extra shiny spikes on Steppenwolf or changing Supermans suit from red & blue to black or tweaking the look of cyborgs digital costume is not really an improvent to the flaws of the original movie nor is extending it out to 4 hours. The rather absurd use of an old fashioned box format to \"preserve the directors artistic integrity\" is pointless unless that artistic integrity, means watching it on a TV from the 1980's. I really can't see the reason for all the 10 ratings this is getting, it is pretty clearly a vanity project for the director whose only aim seems to be to change every little thing he can from the Joss Whedon version. To come up with a movie that is not that different but twice as long. While first the version of Justice League was not great, I actually prefer it, to the new mega long version.", "best four hours": "I dont think any other director or cast or crew can make me watch any movie of any genre for more than two hours without feeling laggy, slow movie feels etc. Watch the movie in 4K / 2160 P to get the full feel of the movie. Music was just amazing and the back ground score in certain scenes were off the charts.", "ITS HERE THE SNYDERCUT": "Finally, it's here, the long awaited, much anticipated, director's cut of the Justice League. Director Zack Snyder finally gets the chance to tell his version of the SAME story, a chance he was sadly denied.Right from the opening credits you get a good sense of what you have signed up for, Superman's death screams are heard loud and clear across the DCEU be it Atlantis or Themyscira.Carried by the sound design and visuals alone it offers a much more engaging opening to the film than all of the predecessors in the series.If you are a true Zack Snyder fan or an admirer of his DCEU than this is for you and specially you. Everything about this franchise and everything about Snyder 's artistic vision is dialed to an eleven.Resulting in a 4 hour long version that doesn't justify its runtime by any means,\nglaring plot holes, heavy CGI reliant action, posing and posing, weird song choices, a slow pace, slow motion(a lot!), yes everything Mr. Zack Snyder prefers is there. A whole lot of scenes don't add coherency to the story and plot but are purely there to satisfy the comic book fanboys.Cyborg gets a whole lot more to do, so does flash and batman, sadly Superman\nis still waiting and posing and held back as usual. Wonder Woman is pushed to the backline while aquaman has the setup for his movie which we have already seen. There's a slew of DC characters all being thrown into the mix, one after another, their introductions go from baffling to meh!. Some of them show up purely to set up future films which we will probably never see.It didn't make me care much about itself as it definitely wanted to but still, I could appreciate the passion and the hardwork put into it by Zack Snyder and am very happy that he got the chance put this out there and I wish him and his family well.Its up to the viewer, Zack Snyder's Justice League exaggerates everything good and bad about the DCEU and Snyder's vision of these characters, if you have been a fan till BVS then it's a must see otherwise it is a painfully long, overdone version of the same from 2017.", "Legendary. Mythological. Apex movie.": "This was beyond what fans were expecting. Top notch cinematography, Great job Junkie XL. Amazing storyline. Thr Cast looked crisp and on fire\ud83d\udd25!\nSuch a fresh and brand new movie. Hats off Zack for pulling it off.

I'm just an old lady who watches what makes me happy. I really don't care about what the critics say. I do notice that this seems like a marvel copy with the boxes being like Infinity Stones. I'm glad Superman is back & knew he would be.", "Aspect ratio is a stroke of stupidity.": "Probably one of the worst superhero films I've ever seen. I couldn't get over the aspect ratio. Why it was chosen still baffles me. I was kind of getting used to it, but when the fight took off at the end I wished I could of seen more. Especially when the Parademons were battling Batman in his Bat-mobile. I'd honestly rather watch the original, or The Amazing Spiderman 2. I'm all for long films. Actually I love them. But this was rather tedious.", "This is a masterpiece": "Although I don't like the screen resolution that is not full, but it pays off with a different story content from the previous version because it is more tense and dark.

Well, Zack Snyder finally did, it was so beautiful. It was emotional and action packed. Finally I'm happy with a DCEU film after a very long time, since MOS and BvS Director's Cut", "The Movie that United a Fandom.": "Never has there ever been a movie to leave such an impact. Most movies like this would be forgotten and left to fade away, but the fans didn't want to give up on a director's vision.But was it worth the wait and effort? Definitely! Zack Snyder's Justice League is everything that makes a fandom great!A passionate director with a vision, beautiful cinematography, every member of the League has a solid purpose and meaningful arc that forwards the story, and the villain has a character instead of being a two dimensional bad guy.I felt all the heroes were redeemed in this version; Batman was a beast, Wonder Woman was a great warrior, Aquaman was a badass and Superman was a powerful force. But Flash and Cyborg were the greatest part of the movie. Both had great chemistry and worked so well together. Flash still had the comedic quips without it doing too silly and Cyborg's pain felt genuine.", "Not worth the hype but definitely better than Whedon's film": "First off, this is a far better film than the Whedon version. However, there were issues... a lot of them, story-wise and CGI-wise. But, here's the biggest question: if Snyder's almost 4-hour cut is still engaging, how much did he actually shoot?ZSJL is eons better than JL. Many characters have bigger arcs. Many fates are met differently. The ending is tenser. It's the best DC film in the last 5 years. But, it's also incredibly dark and depressing. HBO Max should offer valium to everyone who has seen it.I am glad that much of the bad humour in Whedon's version was actually Whedon's idea. None of it is here and thankfully, that makes the characters more serious. However, I do miss the tension between Bruce and Diana. The chemistry here is hardly visible.I was initially surprised by the runtime but as soon as the movie began, I noticed a major fault - slow-motion. Snyder seems to have fallen in love with slo-mo. There's too much of it in the film and while it helps build a little tension, it's mostly annoying because you want to see what's going to happen next but Snyder's slo-mo shots are still keeping you waiting. At a point, I got bored and started skipping 10 seconds ahead to see the end result.The BGM is here and there. It sounds like a rock concert at one point, a template superhero movie at the other and some weird Bjork crap at another. Every time Wonder Woman does something, you hear a hoarse woman doing vocables. You hear her over and over.When the film's finally over, it's not over yet. We get a series of post-credit scenes that happen before the credits roll. My understanding is that it's just going to get much, much worse.Now, with a Black Superman and an Emo Batman in the works, I'm interested to see how the next JL movie pans out.", "Just amazing": "It was the first 4 hours movie I have watched continues without getting bored not a single second\n200% better than The first Josh Whedon Justice league", "Epic, Legendary, Masterpiece The best of the best of the best version ever to be made": "The most Epic, Legendary & Masterpiece of a DCEU Film to date Thanks to Zack Snyder original vision just forget about Whedon cut this is the definitive complete version that should've been made to theatrical release in the first place but I know the backstory behinds it hopes Zack can cope and stay strong to this day and hopefully more will come if Warners Bros decides to greenlit another sequel with Zack returning on the directors chairs of course one can only hope for the best if not then it's okay I'll still take this as the Canon version and yes that's my review for the Zack Snyder Justice League version and what more can I say just Perfect from beginning to the end sequence doesn't feel the runtime draining me over at all everything is carefully well placed crafted totally the the best version ever Thanks Zack Snyder for making this happens cheers \ud83e\udd42 \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude09", "Now finally the Justice League movie we deserve": "4 hours never feel long while watching this masterpiece.

I really felt like watching super heros not super strong dudes punching each other in the face.(I mean it still came down to punching at the end but...) On the contrary original JL has all the problem but without the film time to let Zack show his strong suits. Definentely a better film than the original version, or should I say this is the actual original version.\nPersonnaly I've always been a fan of Zack Snyder movies and his style, and I looked forward to this. His MV esque slow motions never bothered me but if you dont like it be aware there's a lot of them to sit through, especially in the begining of the movie.\nAs you could guess with a 4 hour movie the intro was long. However you have to consider the fact that it has to introduce 2 characters that never got an independant film with their origin and their recruitement. I always took Snyder as someone who goes for style over substance and that's fine but this time it went a little overboard, especially with the intro for flash like, for real?\nWhile most plot points are similar there are substancial changes to certain things at the end and made this movie way better than JL, I am baffled why it was cut out of JL considering JL was only 90 minutes long.\nLet's talk about the ending scenes, there's like 5 of them? I didn't count, but you could really see Zack and DC was going all over the place on this film, and there's just no single definitive direction they want their movies to go. The dream is the most interesting one, made no sense but intriging. The Joker performance is just abysmal, it's really awful, I get why it's not included in JL. He just kept on and on with empty lines, did nothing for the bat, did nothing for me. He just doesn't have the scene presence of Heath Ledger, and his laugh is really weak compared to skywalker's evil laugh. Hopefully this is the last we'll see from Leto joker. One thing I'd give to him is he didn't really have anything good to work on, the dialog of joker is written bad.\nAll in all it's a good film, a good super hero flick. If Zack could cut down his antics a bit, and DC could determine for christ sake where they want to take the DCEU, maybe we'll see some great films from them.", "No...Just No": "This isn't gold.

A brilliant movie which does not seem 4-hr long at all but does perfect justice to the run-time. Not a single boring moment and sheer brillance of film-making vision that can be consumed by viewers in its purity. Many thanks Zack Snyder and much love and respect to you for this . PS: BvS Extended Cut was sheer awesome too \ud83d\ude42 #ReleaseTheSnyderCut", "Six Parts and an Epilogue": "PART 1: The Sum of its Parts\nThe movie is soo long! And watching it feels even longer than the 242min runtime. Snyder decided to break it into seven sections. This feels like it was done to make it more 'epic' rather than to break it into sizeable chunks. The breaks do not help the movie as each section is as incoherent as those around it.PART 2: It's Sooo Long!\nHas that been mentioned yet? It's odd how it's called 'The Snyder Cut' as it doesn't look like anything was actually cut from it. Everything is in there. Some of it is good as you get a lot more understanding and more is definitely more for this film but for a lot of it more also became a chore.PART 3: Tipping the Scales\nWith so much going on and the lack of effective editing the balance of the movie makes it an 'awkward' watch. The lack of cohesion with how the scenes, characters and locations are jammed packed together spread over such a length of time really adds to this soup of a movie.PART 4: Teamwork\nWith all this time there is more opportunity to show more of each character and some of their background. For some (Aquaman, Wonder Woman) they've already got their own movie so it seemed odd that they still got lots of love and attention, Cyborg got his own origins segment but for Barry (The Flash) - whose abilities / involvement is essential to the plot - the most you get is about his dad in jail and smuggling hotdogs to get a job!PART 5: Sound & Vision\nThe Whedon version had plenty of criticism for the unrealistic CGI being used. The revised version in general is no better - in fact sometimes it feels more animation than CGI. Yes there is going to be lots of reasons why but then that's why editing is a good thing. The soundtrack is also out of place with some really odd choices especially with the action scenes.PART 6: Chicken or the Egg\nMarvel and DC have been long term rivals in the comic industry, often competing and copying each others ideas and characters. Whereas the original JL had a weaker story this one just echoed The Avengers too much. Darkseid=Thanos. Steppenwolf=Ronan. Mother Box=Tesseract. Regardless of which came first on screen they look too similar and the ZSJL Flash was a bit too much like Marvels Quicksilver.EPILOGUE:\nFirstly it wasn't an epilogue, it was quite the opposite opening up what may / would have been next in the series. Was this necessary given it's (probably) not going to happen? Would it have been better (& shorter) if Snyder had just rounded off a complete (full) movie. And I think that's the issue. The issues, politics of the original movie still exist in the revised version with regard to what it wants to be. And for all the positive elements which work it still wants to be too much which is why you end up with a 4hr trudge of a movie.", "The best movie in the history! So far!": "Really! I loved every scene and I enjoined every chapter. I felt like the movie was better in all senses. It was like be in a Epic Moment! Inmediatly you know that it.

I actually thought the 2017 version was \"good\" until you watch Zach snyders vision come to life....now the original just makes me mad! This was an incredible movie with amazing character development and action sequences! We wanted to see his vision and we got so much more! Zach Snyder deserves the keys to the DCEU!!", "4:3": "Only problem i have with this movie . Is it's in 4:3.", "Bigger, but the same grade": "Yes, an extended cut straight from Zack Snyder's hand. In a way, he deserves it, but exactly how long is it, though not as terrible as feared. The sound side is terribly repetitive, a bit of C4 does not skip more blocks, CGI and Slo-Motion do not work optimally, not at all when overused, and Darkseid is a wannabe Thanos. I was not a fan of the TV ratio either.However, this edition is more bloody and more cohesive. Right up until the last quarter, that is.And finally a serious question: In the climatic fight with Steppenwolf inside the Reactor, Darkseid appears before the League via a Boom Tube Portal. However, moments later after the victory of the Justice League over Steppenwolf, he states that he wants to prepare an Armada to go to Earth, completely ignoring the fact that he could easily attack Earth by sending in his troops via portals. Why that?", "For 10y olds 10/10 for adults 4/10": "This must be the most immature movie relative to its budget that I have ever watched. And there is no making up for it by fancy action and cgi scenes. What a huge letdown and waste of time.", "It's.....mleh": "I see the fanboys are out in force. Better than the original - absolutely - but this movie isn't 10/10 or a \"masterpiece\".

The majority of the characters (with the exception of Flash, and possibly Wonder Woman) have no personality - they're bland, unlikeable, boring to put it nicely. It's a very long and drawn out movie - unnecessarily so. The score is nothing special - they keep repeating the same tiny bit of music whenever Wonder Woman does something which gets old quite quickly, and the rest of the score doesn't conjure up any emotion whatsoever. There's no humour or light-heartedness, it was all very gloomy and dark (quite literally). The use of special effects makes me feel like I'm watching a bad 80s movie who have just learned about the use of lighting and slow motion effects and got a bit over-excited by it all. There's some \"atmospheric\" screen lighting that happens frequently throughout the film, and trust me, once you've noticed it, you'll never be able to ignore it.It's not a good \"intro film\". If you don't already have good knowledge of the DC universe and previous films, I don't think you're really going to get any appreciation for it. It's a boring plot. I actually started to feel sympathy for the villain near the end.I haven't gave this a 1 star rating though and it's for a very simple reason - I did get to spend 4 hours with my wife, watching this movie and tearing it to shreds, and we had a lot of fun.", "Absolutely": "I absolutely loved it. Worth the 4 hour watch. However I must say I really really dont like Ezra Miller. As an actor and as The Flash.", "This is amazing!": "Honestly, when Justice League 2017 came out, I thought it was a 5/10, but this has changed my opinion massively on this movie and I think the world is now looking forward to the next installment of the D. C. Universe! The amount of scenes shot, video editing, costume design, music produced, etc has been phenomenal. Basically all the effort put into this movie was clearly shown and I was blown away by how great it was. Zack Snyder should continue to do what he's doing because this was just next level! Looking forward to the next installment! :)", "A Visual and Storytelling Masterpiece": "A great comeback from the ripped off version of Zack Snyder's movie that is \"Josstice League\" by Joss Whedon. This film expresses how a director that has their freedom and complete control over their project can do great things incomparable to today's Hollywood movies produced and written by a large group of money-hungry board members. Will watch over and over. Then over again and again.", "Total waste": "I didn't like it acting was terrible and it's too long and so boring", "Better Than The 2017 Film": "Firstly, unlike the theatrical cut, Snyder's Justice League isn't plagued by any cringe, shoehorned humor. Each member plays a significant role and isn't forced to do things that are out of character. Batman is the brains and the core of the team; Superman is the brawns; Wonder Woman is the warrior; and Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg aren't present simply for comedic relief. In fact, Cyborg and Flash are arguably the most important members of this film. Each of them receives their own development and once the movie concludes, a cohesive team has been formed. Moreover, Steppenwolf as a villain has been improved upon - as opposed to wanting to invade Earth without any explanation provided, he is acting as a servant for Darkseid to gain his trust. Aside from his motives, Steppenwolf in the Snyder Cut is a force to be reckoned with, even for the entire Justice League combined.Secondly, the presentation in the Snyder Cut far exceeds that of Whedon's theatrical cut. Despite the ugly color grading, the cinematography was fantastic. Many shots look similar to panels in a comic book, coupled with the flawless special effect that culminated in several visually stunning scenes. The music was decent overall, the dialogue wasn't corny and managed to strike the correct balance of funny and serious, and the story felt far more complete. The action was engaging and one of the highlights of the film, especially during the climax.However, the movie isn't flawless. There were many unrequired slow-motion sequences, and many scenes were somewhat drawn out. As a result of this, the first act consumes nearly half of the movie's length. Alot of sequel baiting happens in the form of more unnecessary scenes. Additionally, due to its long runtime, the Snyder Cut isn't the most rewatchable of films.With that being said, it's a pretty good film all things considered. My rating for it is a B+.", "We deserve justice": "This is what we called justice, #restoresnyderverse.", "The Redemption Of A Prodigal Son": "Zack Snyder did an amazing job creating this masterpiece of a movie. Each element was in perfect synergy from the soundtrack to the picture to the audio mixing to the fight scenes and dialogue.The characters that had not been fleshed out in the Whedon Cut got expanded upon and some were just different for the better, like Cyborg and Flash. It was truly amazing and I loved every minute of the film.I would wish for a sequel and continuations because the execution was really good.The actors performed with heart and soul and some of the CGI was not as good as expected but it was good overall.I have already rewatched this three times and can't wait to see it again in a few months.", "The Best of The Best": "Esta si es lanpelicula que deberiamos haber visto.en cine...

Not bad, not good, it is a mediocre, average superhero movie.6/10", "Miserable": "It is genuinely one of the worst films I have seen in my life and I wasn't even expecting it to be that bad. The film is like a goldmine for movie buffs to look at and slowly pick out everything that makes up bad film making. There are so many examples. It uses an absolutely terrible, out of tone soundtrack for several scenes that make you feel as though you are watching a music video more than a film. It immediately eliminates any tension or feel to it. It also uses a shockingly low amount of its extra 2 hours to any good use. It includes several new scenes to introduce some of the Justice League characters, however, with the exception of Cyborg, none of these add much of any substance to these characters and in true bad scriptwriting fashion, have any payoff whatsoever. A good example is the hilarious and awkward introduction of the Flash, who is shown rescuing a woman from a car crash. Hilariously enough, the female love interest he rescues has no dialogue and the entire sequence is incredibly awkward and dubbed by a hilariously tone-deaf track. And of course, it ultimately means nothing whatsoever to the Flash's character in the film and the girl never returns.The film is horribly paced, not just in terms of structure but even in action sequences. It is often moving along too fast without moments of an levity or a moment to stop and build up to its \"payoffs\" A good example is how Steppenwolf has so little screen time so this makes his presence feel absent from the film. Because of this, you get no sense of threat or danger and there is never really any feeling that you want to root for the Justice League to accomplish anything because he doesn't have enough of a presence. Its 4 hours is used horrendously poorly. Even scenes that try to develop characters more do almost nothing with it and even worse, much of the extra run time is used on additional exposition, often delivered by Diana because that is her purpose in this film. It constantly has to explain itself, sometimes to a very comical degree. Instead of feeling what the characters are experiencing, they have to say it out loud. It's just so incredibly bad. And the slow motion is yet another example of Snyder's bad filmmaking. It could be an effective tool to pronounce action sequences or important events, but Snyder being Snyder instead uses it at every chance he can get, thus eliminating any of its effectiveness. This movie is bloated, sluggish, poorly-paced, lacks character development, has a terrible soundtrack, is overriden with exposition and is boring. it's just a 4-hour version of a film that was already bad.", "Speechless... zAbsolutely brilliant": "A masterpiece .

The biggest improvement over the theatrical cut is that the characters were more developed here. The new scenes provided more backstories and character interactions.Out of all the characters, Cyborg and Steppenwolf benefitted the most from the additional scenes. Cyborg went from being completely forgettable to being the heart of the movie. The theatrical cut really did Cyborg dirty. As for Steppenwolf here, he went from a D-tier villian to a B-tier. In terms of other superhero villains, he isn't as good as Heath Ledger's Joker or Thanos, but Steppenwolf's added backstory made him more memorable to me.Besides the extra scenes with Cyborg and Steppenwolf, other new character-building scenes I enjoyed were the expanded flashback of Darkseid's invasion, Lois Lane's conversation with \"Martha Kent\", and the extra conversations between the Justice League members.Another major improvement over the theatrical cut is the third act. Not only was the action better, this third act actually made me excited for future movies. When the theatrical cut ended, I couldn't care less for the DCEU. When this movie ended, I was actually hyped for future movies. Hopefully if this movie is successful, Zack Synder will be allowed to finish the rest of the storyline.If I had to go over issues with the movie, the biggest one I had is that some of the new scenes felt unnecessary. One scene that comes into mind is the Flash's new introduction. I get that it's introducing his love interest, but she literally has no lines with Barry here. I think Barry visiting his father in prison is a better character introduction.Another unnecessary moment for me was when Martha Kent was revealed to be Martian Manhunter. I felt they should've done the reveal in another scene. I thought the reveal after the conversation with Lois Lane ruined the emotional impact of that scene.Overall, Zack Synder's Justice League is a better movie than the theatrical cut. Although there are some unnecessary scenes, this version develops the characters more and has a better third act. I give Zack Synder's Justice League an 8/10.", "I'm in love with the DC Universe all over again": "You know a movie is something special when you sit through a 4hr film, yet it feels like 2hrs and you still don't want it to end.\nIts mind bending to witness the genius of Zack Snyder in taking a film that I never wanted to watch again (and I loved the DC Universe) and make it gritty and brilliant and everything that I so wished for when the original was released.\nI guarantee that every actor involved is over the moon at this cut.\nBravo Mr. Snyder.

The always in doubt flash found his true purpose and the Amazon and Atlantean found their common ground.

And Oh Boy it didn't disappoint and exceeded my expectations. So much better than the original movie. 4 Hrs is a long time but took a break only because my 8 year old daughter wanted to have some chips and juice. Really I think Zack Snyder has done justice to the film. The VFX were so much better and it was such an engaging movie. I can surely say that DCU is as good as MCU.SO SO MUCH BETTER. LOVED IT.", "This is an Awesome movie for sure!": "Zack snyder version of Justice league is so inspiring and thrilling. The justice is served for every characters and villian is much more threatening and looking badass in this version rather being dumbass and momma's boy in josstice league. I dont know why people still dont like zacks version like they complaint and wanted more of character development and emotions in man of steel Now when there is everything here they still want to hate it. The gaps are filled but they have a reason to hate it:( 4 hours long ).This is 4 hours long but I never felt watching it more than 3 hours. The pacing is so smooth you will not have to leave in between. And Guys it is been divided into chapters so you dont have to worry about taking break and it is not the theaters situation but you are watching it in tv with your comfort.We would have got the final chapter of snyderverse this year but .....\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\nStill we have faith that we can finally get it.I just wanna say thanks to all the supporters and fans who made this movie possible.#Restorethesnyderverse.", "The myth the legend at last zack snyder cut made it": "I have been following since the original story broke out and the disappointment we all witnessed in 2017. I read all the rumors what the original story could be and how so much better it was. I watched it twice and it just shines through all its glory. The plot is more of the same, story is building to much more good stuff for the future. Every scene feels much more complete from Diana fight scene to Stephen wolf fighting Amazonians. Cyborg story is much more developed and more action pack of old gods scene. Highly recommended\n#RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Little better but tooo long!!!!!!!!!": "Yes! It has some better action scenes. The theatrical version had some really cheesy moments that not in this version. However some well alone of the footage just drags on adding nothing to the movie. What they did to Darkseid may no sense..if you watch you know exactly what I am talking about. Made Darkseid look like a weakling....really DC. Wonder Woman and Superman come across a little more DC then goody-two-shoe. Final thought the DC series could be so much better.", "WAY better than the theatrical cut": "Still cannot believe WB released a 2-hour piece of garbage back in 2017 when we should've got this. Hopefully the Snyderverse will be restored. #RestoretheSnyderverse", "best movie ever": "Best movie I ever saw loved it better keep that snyder guy around", "This is an absolute masterpiece": "While it feels like cultural factions have been fighting over \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" for years, the winners ultimately will be the fans. 'ZSJL' is a fan cut as much as it is a director's cut, with all the indulgence that the notion applies. As for any continuation of the story as the fans hope, that seems gravely unlikely considering the direction Warner Bros is headed. But for a director who had to abandon his grand superhero project because of a family tragedy and because a big movie studio tried to wrestle control of the film, which was too much to bear at the time, one supposes, this postmortem collectible for die-hard, is about as good as an outcome as one could get.", "Better but....": "The problem with this movie is I cannot see Ben like Batman or any other superhero. He already destroy Daredevil and he is on his way to do the same with Batman.Has he something against the best artworks of frank Miller with supers?", "This is a fanboy flick!": "Completely unrealistic. Fat cheeks Ben squeezed into that costume. So many flaws in this game, its sick. So mich hype, and it fails.predictably...yes bad acting yes... its all CGI anyways.", "Zack Synder Pants": "First up Absolutely watch it even at 4 hours it doesn't feel long and keeps you fully engaged now that's out the way....Zack Synder made this film in 4:3 aspect ratio he claims for the Imax experience! Most of the Imax Cinema's where I live closed long ago. The aspect ratio makes it difficult to watch especially on a wide screen TV, it was like watching a badly cropped pirate movie. Although the paid media critics/salesmen are praising his decision....really?Technically the movie was an absolute mess there was so much CGI/Green screen the picture quality was all over the place, On minute it was crisp HD the next a horribly blended CGI shot where it looked blurry. This was used quite a bit for added scenes where 2 character's were talking in front of a green screen background it looked awful. There are definitely a few bad cut scenes stat are obvious too such as when Hippolita is walking to the edge of the cliff after the dome crashes into the water. Some the the extra scenes looked TV quality as opposed to some that looked far cleaner it really was a technical mess.I also want to mention a few hours ago when i checked the reviews after watching it a second time there were over 2000 reviews. As i type the are only 1500 so 500 reviews have been deleted....I wonder why.....looks at score. It also amazing how many 10/10 reviews are being posted literally whole pages and this is not a 10/10 movie.Really looking at Synder's resume Watchmen, Man Of Steel Justice league 2017 version they were all solid but not brilliant some even called them flops. From when he appears at the beginning and doesn't say anything of interest I wondered why appear? Then the opening credits roll Jack Snyder's Justice League but but the Justice league was born in the 1960's comics, what has Synder got to do with it apart from 2 bad remakes of somebody else's creation.Its also said they are to release a black and white version to try and add a further artistic slant on this experience not sure why. Lastly though apart from the technical shambles Synder made Batman say the F word, why just no need its their values that immortalise them, it was cheap!", "Magnum opus": "Loved it from the start to finish ... brilliant \ud83e\udd17", "Officially Craving more from DC!!": "This is everything I've always wanted out of a DC film and so happy for this release they really lost me with the terrible original film but now I am back I'm hoping we get more like this in the future!!

Well, I'm comparing it to the other movies like the Man of Steel, Marvel's Avengers, Independence Day, and others. The absence of people from the surroundings near the alien hive. Where are they? Anyway, it's a good movie.", "A grandiere": "Absolute Magnum Opus.every characters had their moment.

A Movie Restored": "Absolutely must see movie if you are Comic Book Movie Fan, Zack Snyder Fan, or Action Fan. Seriously better than most other comic book films because everything feels earned. Will erase the 2017 version from your memory if you even still remember it.Their is an incredible amount of heart from the character of Cyborg, alot of funny moments from Flash, lots of Aquaman banter and badassness, Batman has newfound hope, Wonder Woman is a Warrior Woman, and Superman proves why he is granddaddy of all superheroes.Do not listen to the haters, doubters, or biased critics. See and judge for yourself a movie brought to you from people from all walks of life, races, and genders from all around the world who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Suicide Prevention.Only Negative I can see is of the 6 Parts (7 including the Epilogue) to this movie, Parts 2 & 3 are bit long and could have been trimmed by a few minutes but its a minor issue.Bring on a sequel.", "Magnificent": "The movie how it should have always been done. And seen. A masterpiece that flows seamlessly right until the last scene. It was a quick 4 hours that left me wanting more. One of the best films of 2021 and one of the best superhero movies out there.", "An improvement, but...": "People should stop treating this movie like it reinvented the superhero genre. It didn't. Granted, it surpassed the theatrical version and improved the plot, character development and overall atmosphere. But the movie still suffers from problems such as being too long for its own good, CGI atrocities and and cringy dialogue to name a few. 7/10 from me. Hoping to see an improvement if we get to see a sequel.", "Slow Motion \ud83d\udc0c": "This movie is 4 hours long.If you get rid of the slow motion scenes, or at least play them at normal speed then this movie is about 50 minutes long.Why people rallied online to get this version released is a mystery.

The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.The Directors: Zack Snyder did an awesome job directing a Justice league movie. He love directing DC Superhero Movies. The Actors: the Stars Henry Cavill as Superman, Ben Affleck (Argo and Gone Girl) as Batman, Gal Gadot (Fast and Furious Franchise) as Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher (True Detective) as Cyborg, Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) as Aquaman, Ezra Miller (Fantastic Beasts Movies) as The Flash and the rest of the cast like Diane Lane, Willem Defoe (Spider-Man 2002), Jeremy Irons (The Lion King), J. K. Simmons (Spider-Man Trilogy). Its the Live-Action DC Crossover Movie that the Fans Love it. It's Got Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-fi in it. My Favourite Scenes are the Battle Scenes and Superman Scenes. I Watched it on Binge with my Dad. I love it because it's a Hardcore Action Superhero moviesNote: it cheers me up from the Terrible Batman v Superman Ending and i feel Satisfying.I give it 10/10Now Availabile on iTunes, Google Play, 4K UHD, Blu-Ray and DVDthanks for reading.", "Awesome movie... so glad Zack Snyder decided to complete this unfinished piece of work": "The move was great but WHY was it in 4:3 Letterbox format??", "Good but not great!!!": "Okay so I just finished this movie and I have to say it is way better than the theatrical one. Right from the start I knew that this was gonna be better. However, it wasn't great. I love DC but there are alot things that are still missing in the movie. Firstly it was way too long. Didn't much care for the many slow-mo scenes and extra parts which did not necessarily need to be a part of the movie. As a matter of fact I liked the first fight scene with steppenwolf better than the last. DC has so much potential and I do hope it improves as the universe expands.", "This is wayyyyyyy above my expectation": "This is simply THE BEST. This Snyder Cut should be released in 2017 instead of the Josstice League trash. DC Comics has its own vibe. It should be dark and serious. I can tell Zack is one of the biggest DC fan and he knows how to satisfy us all.", "A 4 Hour must watch treat": "This is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. The length may be a problem for some but it's worth it. The trademerk slow motion shots of Zack Snyder and background music has made every frame of the movie spectacular. It developed the characters beautifully. The climax and anti climax are also in perfecy sync.", "Better... but looooonng!!": "Much better story but way too long.First the bad: Full screen aspect ratio, WTF??? Lots coulda been cut outta this and not be missed. Ezra Miller is still annoying as The Flash and is a worse miscast than Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Still dont care about The Cyborg character. Coulda replaced him with almost any other DC hero and woulda been better. Also whats with the over dramatics on almost every scene? Battle scenes still look like a video game.Now the good: story makes more sense.", "Unforgettable Movie": "This movie is great and definitely needs to be rewatched!

NO": "So many mistakes, stupid scenes, ridiculous comic relief that just dont work. Flash actor is terrible, bad writing. Aquaman, what up with that shirt? On or Off? he comes out of the water with a shirt on, but takes it o to go back in... Hollywood... They really go for a Watchmen kind of vibe, and is just horrible.. Oh, and back to the car crash scene with The Flash, its been done before my dudes, its called X-men, and why that stupid thing with the sausage... I would say \"its a do over\", but i really with you would just leave the DC universe alone, trainwreck every time..", "It's really, really long...": "I'm not a fan as such, I just like good movies. If you're like me, I don't think you'll care much for this version. It does fill in some of the missing backstory, and\nthe computer graphics are far far superior to the original release, but...It's long-winded, pretentious, posturing, oratorical and full of shots that linger for no reason. The endless battles are just that and there's little fun to be had. The acting is actually pretty decent when given decent dialog. That does happen at times, though it's more often full of trite morality and angst that only people who've never experienced real life would find compelling.I don't mean to offend fans. If you're a real DC head and want to spend 4 hours reveling in your preconceived universe, I can see the appeal. But I'd like to see a tight 2 hour cut using the better CG.If they'd spent the bucks on the CG for theatrical release I'd recommend that as a far better movie for the average viewer.All that said, I did watch it to the end, with liberal skipping of duller material.", "Much much much better": "Let's hope that WB allows Snyder to keep making justice league movies the way he wants to. So much better", "Boss movie but leaves me wanting more": "A far superior film to the 2017 version which is not a good movie. I loved BVS, flawed but this is the sequel I was looking for all these years.", "Decent installment": "There's just so many superhero movies these days that they all start to run together. How do you stand out when it's a genre of its own now? Maybe you don't. Yes, production values and action sequences were impressive but the stories are all the same anymore.", "Hear me out": "Ok.... there are aspects that are significantly better than the original Justice League. I'll go over them now: the final battle is way better and the stakes were more convincing. I liked the flashback battle showing Darkseid being driven off but there were some flaws even with it. Cyborgs story was much improved and a very welcome addition to the original. Superman came across better although I still hate that he died in the first place (I'll save it for a different rant). I didn't love that Steppenwolfs main weapon did nothing to him though. Did he know it wouldn't hurt? Seems presumptuous.Now the bad. First, it is 4 hours. So as a single movie being 4 hours is waaaaaaay too long. As different episodes it didn't work because each chapter doesn't tell a contained story with a bigger arc. It just break a long movie up so you have a stopping point for bathroom and snack break. Specifically the first hour is near useless to the movie. The flashback battle while I liked it did go a bit long and did make Darkseid seem rather weak. Feels like it could have been edited better to address both those issues.Additionally the apocalyptic ending was also useless. I know it was an effort to draw up interest for a spin-off or sequel but it came from no where and felt like an excuse to shoehorn in some extra things - eg. Joker.If this was cut to a 2.5 hour-ish I'm sure it would have been more palatable. I'm happy that a studio that historically NEVER listens to its audience finally did. But over-worshipping the film isn't the answer to get them to do it again. It's not a film you'll want to watch more than once and will not stand the test of time.Side note: Hard for me to call it a different \"cut\" of a movie when they gave an additional $75 million to do reshoots and CG improvements.", "Justice wated": "Who wrote this ten minutes, in and you fall asleep from boredom, the worst after wonder woman 1984 which is on the same level and i would say improvement to the directors directing in the manner of do not watch this is you are sane.", "Live action comic": "What a great change I loved from the first minute, Chris Nolan's Batman, Watchmen and ZS Justice leguage are great movies for comic fans.\nChange your mind WB, we need Zack Snyder film universe.", "The Dr. Schiwago of super-hero movies": "I loved almost every second of the movie.

But Justice league was shallow and over the top. Unrealistic even for a super hero movie. No depth of relationships and for a 4 hours movie, they feel rushed. Acting isn't the greatest if you pay attention, lines are brief and meaningless. All these big cinema CGI blockbusters have been doing it for the last decade (Transformers and Avengers...) All show and no go. Just action and visual orgasm, nothing more. Adding to the reflections of 21st century culture of consumerism and materialism.What happened? All that money and budget and we get crappily rendered Aliens and a Ben Affleck scene (If anyone noticed). Maybe its not about giving the people what they want.

Batman plays his part very well rather than whedon's version where gets hurt easily, weak & made me think, was this the same batman in bvs??? If there's another project, I'd like batman to be as kinetic, fast like the animated jl. Wonder woman saving people, just wow.

After watching JL released in 2017 I wasn't sure this movie would have something special, but for those who think these two movies have something in common they DON'T!!!Saddest thing is that Snyder confirmed there will be no sequel, although he had planned 2 more movies.

Character arcs are far more better than 2017 movie(josstice league is what people call it nowdays). It has great character development. The movie is about sacrifices people make so that the others can live to fight another day and the hard choices people have to make to save others. Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman has more screen time and responsibilities. Wonder Woman is depicted as the Warrior she is in DC comics, Atlantians and Amazons have more screentime, Martian Manhunter Reveals himself, Kinghmare timeline story continues(2017 Joss Whedon movie didn't contain the knightmare timeline), Cyborg is the heart of the movie, Steppenwolf is not the only villain, History lesson(Diana telling Bruce) has more screen time and characters. Also history lesson story is different from the 2017 movie. The ending of the movie reveals its the beginning of a new story. But please watch Man of Steel & Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice before this if you haven't watch them. And make sure to pay attention while watching. And I must thank Zack and Deborah Snyder, their whole crew including all the actors and actresses, and every other living & passed away souls who helped to bring this movie to the world for us to watch it.", "Good job for Snyders cut": "This is what fans hope for.

The upgraded Wonder Woman theme made me feel the same way I did when she entered into the fray in BvS, incredible.Just like Man of Steel and Batman V Superman before it, Zack Snyder's Justice League will be spoken about for years to come. Zack went all out and delivered phenomenally.", "This really delivered!": "Zack Snyder really delivered in this new cut. I was sceptical because I didn't like the original, but I'm so happy with how it turned out. It was a blast! I was invested in the characters. The plot was great. The action and VFX were awesome.

I constantly caught myself throughout the movie saying \"Why would they cut that out?!\" Seriously so many essential scenes that make you CARE about the story and characters.4 hours might seem long going into it but considering the movie has to introduce so many characters, it's kind of necessary. I'm not one for long movies but I wasn't bored at any point during this film. It was a well told story and a great start to what should've been!This is what fans envisioned. It's what Snyder envisioned. It's what all the actors envisioned and expected; I'm so glad they can all get their recognition!

This is the film that DC fans like myself have been waiting for. So if you're a casual fan of superhero movies or more a fan of what Marvel has to offer, this movie is 4 hours long and I wouldn't recommend it for you. But if you're a fan of DC and been patiently waiting for that definitive DC film, wait no longer, your wait is over. 10000 stars, 4 hours didn't bother me at all.

This movie is terrific. I loved it.It is a thousand times better than the one released in the theaters, the plot makes so much more sense now, the CGI is awesome, Steppenwolf is an actual threat now. Also, the main characters are now right, as well deserved, Wonder Woman in the Snyder Cut is a kind and badass hero, Batman does not make those horrible jokes that don't go with the character and The Flash and Cyborg finally have their development in the movie.

There's no continuing the Snyderverse, which is just a damn shame because Darkseid War was teased and best of all, Injustice was teased, but we'll get none of that now.

Mustache twirling villains, poorly motivated hero's you don't care about who make stupid decisions and on and on.\nSnyder obviously uses the same approach as Jar Jar Abrams and creates action scenes first then attempts to sew them together into a (only somewhat coherent) story.\nPeople here are saying this is a superhero movie \"for adults\" not really. If you want that watch the far superior Logan.

Be realistic...and if you never do that well it's understandable why you are complaining.But it was a great movie that you can enjoy every second. Got slow parts but its giving emotion to the characters. They fix that too, the personality of everybody and feels right and the background too.So stop complaining its long. Also i understand if you see it at the Theater. But it was on HBO MAX too.

But when I watched Zack Snyder's cut, each hero had a chance to shine as well as the people connected to them. For example the Amazons in 2017 were made to look weak, but Zack Snyder sets this right in his cut to show how strong and determined they actually are. In Zack Snyder's cut, it really felt like the other heroes would've pulled it off without superman but he was a nice addition.", "About the movie.": "So, this movie is WAY to enjoyable than the first movie, everyone got their moments to shine and it had nice photography and nice hints like deathstroke, martian etc but the thing is the resolution was like Instagram filters , I love the darkness of this but I can't stand to the resolution at the end of the movie (in steppenwolf's place) was to high it destroys the movie for me and doesn't has nice taste.\nSteppenwolf is like a really bad guy with hate and cruelty in his mind and he looks like strong BAD guy not like a random dude like the first one, the movie is 4 hours , to long for my taste but not bad four hours the passes really nice and I enjoyed it.If the first was 04/10 for me this one is 07/10 if the resolution was better or at least with the darkness gives you different kind of resolution will not be so bad, anyway very good try.", "ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIES OF ALL TIME. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse": "Ten times better than the theatrical version.

Everything is at the right place and done the right way. Story, actors, effects, music... you name it.No hate against Joss Whedon, he had to jump in and finish it quickly, plus he did not have the luxury to make it 4 hours long, but this version is better than the original in every conceivable way. I would prefer Snyder making all the future Superman/Batman movies with his version being canon, though it does not seem to be possible.

The story has direction, the villain has a purpose, the action is better, the characters all have development.This Justice League feels like a team, not just the backup singers to Superman that we got in the last one. Once you truly see the scope of what Snyder was trying to bring to life, you begin to appreciate what this project really was, a love letter to fans. The bottom line is that I came into this with low expectations and I left demanding the restoration of the Snyderverse. This is truly Snyder's masterpiece and I know his daughter would be proud of him.

The characters all had good backstories that were shown and explained and I felt the story was more cohesive. There needed to be lots of buildup and backstory to set everything up, therefore the length of this movie is justified. The theatrical cut just felt rushed with not much explaination of the stakes. I liked that Steppenwolf was more of a henchman to Darkseid rather than the main villain, showing an even greater threat and stakes the Justice League were fighting for. The use of the Flash in the final battle was also WAY better than the theatrical version. Flash's scene in the theatrical cut was so out of place and irrelevant, while in the Snyder Cut he actually played an essential role in the teams' success.", "mind blown": "No spoilers here... please ogo and watch this awesome movie its not in theatres so take ur time and support this... its on par with inifinity war in terms of scale and scope.", "Great Movie!": "A superior and more insightful version of the movie, its long but its good!", "2hrs too long": "Seriously, it did not need 4+hrs to tell that story and then only to have it end so pathetically...wait for part 2, hopefully not another 4hr drawn out sequel\ud83d\ude44", "Makes more sense, still not good.": "This is a movie where even when it's high noon it's still dark out. Attempts at humor are few and fall flat. Snyder is so focused on the big picture, important small details are missed. For example, how could Darkseid forget he left the mother boxes and the anti-life equation on Earth? If parademons can smell the sent of the mother boxes on people, how come they can't smell the mother boxes themselves? So many plot holes, so much generic dialogue, so much heavy-handed imagery. Snyder does not respect his audiences' intelligence in the least. Hard pass.", "The Snyder cut owns the original JL it's success": "If it wasn't for the original justice league this movie would've bombed so bad, the reason being that this movie on its own as an independent movie was more of a \"meh\", however if you compare it to the Joss Whedon cut, then it's a real improvement...I'm not going to talk about how long the movie is cause there's good movies that were as long, instead I'm going to talk about other things that I didn't like:I have no idea how the timeframe of the movie works, does the movie take place over a few days? Months? I'm pretty sure not a whole year... right? Some scenes look like they happen back to back, while others look like they're ages away... a nice 3 days later or something like that would've been cool..There's 6 league members instead of the iconic 7... this is well not very appreciated, but the fact that the characters insists on bringing that on over and over is what makes it suck even more. Aqua man getting undressed to swim just for him to emerge from the water dressed again? Too many undressing scenes for no apparent reason...The lady sniffing the shirt...We can go over how the movie feels like a musical at sometimes especially in the first half of the movie...I hate Martian man hunter in this movie by the way, everything from the grayish design to him being Martha cheapening the scene, and even to him not doing anything until the end of the movie,,, him being in the movie is pure fan service,Remember flash? Less annoying, still annoying. Remember cyborg? Way better now.. except when he's told he can nuke a city at whim if he wanted... to not use his superpowers of hacking to do anything really meaningful... he just felt under used... his backstory is fleshed out way better, he's practically the main character. Remember aqua man? Still not impressiveRemember wonderwoman? She has a theme song now, and one cringe sceneRemember Superman? For some reason he CHOOSES the black suit, I think it's just edgy that's why... I mean in the original comics he was resurrected while wearing it, cause it helped... but here it just looked cool...\nIt killed me when I saw Clark Kent opening Up his shirt to reveal the black suit under it...The movie was underwhelming at best and a cheap disgusting way to buy the fans over at worst...", "It's not \"cut\" but a full fledged scene": "Wow, what a story teller Snyder's cut will blow your mind.

That being said, the movie is the definition of style over substance.The movie has somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes of pointless/indulgent filler that does little to nothing for the main plot, nor the paper thin and one-dimensional characters. The pacing suffers immensely because of this, especially in the first half.There are about half a dozen scenes in the entire movie where any character feels human or relatable in any meaningful way, and for the rest they are just stick figures flailed about to make the plot progress or to look cool. The best improvement by far in this version is the treatment of Cyborg who actually gets some characterization. I also really like the Barry-father scene, but that is almost it.The plot is also almost literally children slamming their action figures together with very little rime nor reason beyond \"defeat the big bad evil guy\". The movie flip flops from heavy-handed overexplaining to left field jumps with almost no connecting foreshadowing or build up.The action and spectacle is the main focus of the movie, and that it does mostly well; especially with some really good scenes at the end. However it is not enough to keep you engaged through 4 hours of action figure cgi-fiestas slamming into each other.All in all, a significant improvement on the original version is not enough to make it a good movie.", "Predictably, it's trash": "It's overwrought. It's got way too many damn lines and dumb character sequences and too many moments ago where you're going why the heck would he/she/they do that? If you hated superman returns, and you hated Batman versus superman, you're going to hate this too I assure you.But this is not for us. This is for Zack Snyder's extremely loyal fan base.

A good director knows the importance of creating the ultimate trilogy. Imagine one day, you could have looked on your shelf and saw the MOS trilogy sitting next to TDK trilogy. We could have gotten that but instead, Zack chose to stick it to the fans and WB by creating a 4 hour long Golden compass. WB execs saw this and smartly told him to lose all the franchise building, character building and epilogue that will lead to NOWHERE yet what did he do? Try to use his fans to attempt to gain control of the DC universe again?It's not going to happen. It would be a fan fiction experiment that wouldn't fit with the REAL DC universe that's been going quite well since JL. Best hope is what? A streaming show like marvel does on disney plus? Think all these high profile actors will sign up for that garbage? And who is gonna pay for that? The studio you guys are boycotting , sabotaging and bad mouthing? Get real.If you feel cheated, feel like you want more, feel like a foundation was laid and you NEED it to continue? Don't blame WB, blame Zack. He KNEW this was his opportunity to complete his trilogy. WB honored that legacy every director should want. To complete their story. I get it, this originally was designed to continue with like 10 more movies in Zacks eyes but what he chooses to lie to himself about is that he can will that into existence too.He can't. No one can.

Non DC fans will find it very difficult to sit through 4hrs of material which they hardly understand. The movie requires knowledge of the DC universe and its major characters. It also helps if one watches the previous DC movies prior to watching this.As for the criticisms regarding the 4:3 aspect; I personally suspect this is Zack Snyder's homage to the Justice League animated series. In any case, I don't think it spoils the experience - a 16:9 ratio would conversely cut out details from the top and bottom...Without giving any spoilers, I am glad this version was made. It addresses the continuity issues that the theatrical version had, and all the annoying elements of the latter are thankfully excluded.", "Yeah not a 10 but definitely an improvement": "Justice league - one of the worst films ever to be embraced by the good Gods of s***e things.DC in their embarrassment spent a fortune and got the remakeover of a dud....The Snyder cut.Well when it says cut....I think at nearly 4 hours long....not sure how cutty Snyder actually got with it.More the Snyder add ons.Well I am happy to say that DC have polished a turd produced a cinematic experience albeit, and inexplicably, in a 4:3 format (which you get used to quickly enough) with lots of fillers, proper Basil exposition and at least something that actually makes sense.Gone is the weird CGI moustache removal of the original. In this version, A lot more is explained as to why things happened. It actually makes sense. Some fun comic moments mostly from The Flash. Victor (the cyborg) has a much more deeper and crucial role in this one than he did in the original. He is probably the shining light in this film. Wonder Woman is ace (great fight scenes with her in it). Affleck's Batman just broods and is still a long way from Bale's version. Aquaman and superman....well I feel proper body shamed me!As films go, it's alright. Completely daft and nowhere as intriguing or interesting as a Marvel movie but still we can now strip the title of one of the worst films ever made from this version of Justice League. It's actually ok. More akin to Batman vs Superman than any other film.And by the end Snyder throws everything in there (Kitchen sink, plug hole, taps, the draining board, the fairy liquid etc). Adding a 30+ minute epilogue (well it felt like it) Introducing Lex Luthor for no reason. Some bloke with an eyepatch for no reason. Jared Lego's Joker for no reason. Lots of weird dream sequences for no reason. Some weird shape shifty joblet for no reason.The villains in this are proper rubbish TBH. They are so vacuous. Just larger than life (literally) menacing looking creatures that just do evilly things just cos they want to rule everything. You take Thanos (a marvel creation) who is so deeply constructed that you get why he's doing what he's doing. With SteppenWolfe and Darkseid...it's all paint by numbers baddy.In any case This film brings to an end the embarrassment that has been DC of late (original justice league or Suicide squad) and hopefully we can start anew with The Batman (and last year's excellent Joker).Seriously though Cavil with his shirt off....Good God man....avert your gaze!It's a perfectly ok film.

Perhaps, it's one of the reasons why it has such high rates because when looking at the movie in a more or less unbiased manner without all those expectations DC fans have held the outcome seems not that shiny.First and foremost, its unusually lengthy nature might be appealing to the fans but scare other watchers who are not that sophisticated in the universe and what used to happen there before. After all, the prolonged timing manages to tell us a more or less cohesive story of only one character - the Cyborg. As for the rest of the league, there are just short anecdotes from their lives presented. In other words, the film should not be perceived as an independent self-explanatory work but one more episode of a whole series of movies. It's an additional proof to the fact that its spectator must already be acquainted with the prior stories to fully enjoy this one.Secondly, there is almost nothing more than classical plot about superheroes fighting against supervillains to save the world. Sure, it's all peppered with tons of spectacular graphical effects, though the dialogs are fairly primitive and predictable, the characters are plain and without any controversies (not like what we've seen in Christopher Nolan's Batmans or in Joker by Todd Phillips), the story is straightforward with nearly no intrigues.In the end, Zack Snyder's Justice League appears as one more super heroic movie within its own established universe, which should be known and loved prior to watching. Plenty of fans compare it with the previous version of the same story which turned up to be even weaker. So, in the context of the earlier film this one might indeed make a shinier impression. However, when considering it as the sole version, it doesn't hold water, as long as you're not crazy about the whole series.", "Heck yeah": "Now this is awesome, a jump back to the golden age of movies where story and good characters are the focus.

Most of the time I and up deleting from half to 2/3rd of material.In this version of the movie, the opposite happened. Zack Snyder took all his material in just stuck it together, hoping for... I don't know what. While this version added a couple of good scenes, the majority (additional two hours!) just made the pacing of the movie uneven, the story bloated, even more boring, with no sense of direction.

The character arcs (both heroes and villains) are fully fleshed out, the action is more thrilling, and the plot is now a clear continuation of what originally had been set up with Man of Steel and BvS Ultimate. The standout difference in this cut is Cyborg. The script paints an interesting and unique plight for the superhero and Ray Fisher's performance is compelling.I'm already in the process of rewatching it, which is something I can't say for other 3+ hour films.

No joy, the CGI is circa 2003. It demeans the characters. It makes the original seem like a brilliant movie. The schlock is unreal. The CW shows improve over this in dialogue, effects, character development. I'm humiliated for anyone involved in this edit. The use of the term Force majeure in this is not amusing. Snyder wouldn't know a joke if it were tattooed on his forehead. They linger over the first three hours then put most of the action in the last 30 minutes.\nAs if they simply got bored. You'll be bored way before then. I wanted this to be good. It's not. Don't try to say it is. Go re-watch any Avengers movie. Watch the animation films. Watch paint dry.

It makes the theatrical version a child's play. Those who are spreading hatred telling it's the same movie (even many of them didn't watch the full movie), I'll tell them it's the original justice league all along.

Super powerful bad guys, requiring a team of superheroes to defeat. I thought the performances were good, and the characters likeable. But there were so many scenes where they just lined up the heroes in some sort of poster pose, and panned around for minutes. Could they have told the story in 3 hours--certainly, in 2 hours--probably, in 90 mins -- maybe. Very corny dialogs, ala \"when I grow up can I be like you? -- When you grow up, you can be whoever you want to be.\" barf. This is the kind of movie where you don't need to pause it to go to the bathroom; Did I miss anything? Not really, just the current heroes standing around taking in the sunset in the aftermath of a battle, again.", "Bigger is Not Necessarily Better": "A good example of why you should never listen to a fanbase. While the theatrical version was no great shakes, at least the story was coherent and it moved along. This was just an interminable\nslog, filled with useless scenes. Martian Manhunter?

Yes, I'm going to compare it to Avengers because X-men isn't quite the same. In avengers each character has a bond/relationship/depth with at least one other character, but here it's just lacking and feels superficial. A lot of items and ideas resemble Avengers.... I just can't dive into this concept because it doesn't have enough substance and connection. My favorite part was Flash and that's saying a lot; I've NEVER liked Flash....", "Pop quiz: how many times does Wonder Woman's theme play throughout the film?": "14 times!Is this better than the original version? Sure. Are there an absurd number of questionable director's decisions in editing, song choices, camera shots, expositionary dialogue moments that feel super forced, goofy slow-motion sequences that had no reason to be shot in slow-motion, long moments of brooding, scenes and shots specifically put in to sell posters, really bad set-ups for lame punchlines, shameless product placements, scenes shot that add very little to the story and pad to its already absurdly long runtime, bad tactical decisions made by the heroes in combat situations (I'm looking at you Wonder Woman destroying the bank after saving it from the bomb or you Batman for charging into Steppenwolf's base alone only for everyone to join you a few moments later), and loads of sequel bait? Absolutely!My favorite scene: Where Barry talked with his dad at the prison. That was a genuinely heartfelt moment that brought a lot of characterization to the Flash that was sorely needed. My friends and I watched this movie together and were talking through every scene cracking jokes and making fun of the film nitpicking everything, and this was legitimately the only scene in the entire movie we were all silent and had no jokes to make about it. This is a good example of how storytellers should add exposition to a story. Involve it naturally in conversation and build up to it. Don't force it on the viewer.The scene that made me laugh the hardest: Aquaman saves a fisherman whose boat gets toppled by the ocean. Instead of saving the boat which he is fully capable of doing, he carries the man back to a pub, pours himself a drink, says, \"It's on him\" walks out of the bar as this slow indie-pop song \"There Is a Kingdom \"plays\" in which Jason Momoa walks towards the beach in slow-motion, alcohol in hand, as the waves come crashing at ridiculously high levels, and he proceeds to finish the bottle and toss his trash into the ocean, rips his shirt off and throws that into the ocean, so we can look at his wet and glistening skin and see his hair swaying in the wind in high definition, up close and personal, before he gets consumed by this absolute monstrosity of a double wave that comes out of nowhere so the editors can fade away cut to Aquaman swimming to his next location. This is the most Zack Snyder-esque scene in the entire movie. You'll either love it because you worship the ground he walks on, or you'll find it ridiculous.My Biggest Gripes and things I nitpick about:*Why wouldn't Darkseid try to come to Earth immediately after realizing that the three Motherstones were there? Why would you trust Steppenwolf to achieve something that you couldn't years ago? Answer: So a sequel can happen*Do the Amazons really not have a more efficient way of getting Wonder Woman to contact them? Did they really have to shoot an arrow into this obscure location and set it on fire, hoping that it would get put on the news so that Diana would glance at the TV while working and realize that she needed to head to that location, use the arrow to unlock the secret ruins underneath the temple, and then read this super vague prophecy about Darkseid's eventual arrival? I feel like the Amazons would benefit from getting with the times and sending Diana a message on facebook or something.*How hard was Batman looking to find the other heroes? All it took for Diana to find Cyborg was to search his name. Did Batman not already try this?*Is Barry Allen poor or not? I don't get it. He has this heartfelt scene with his dad where he talks about working odd-end jobs to save up so he can go to law school to one day get his dad out of prison, but then he goes into his \"man cave\" where he has this super high-tech and expensive-looking computer set-up with his costume being held up on this fancy-ass stand which Batman himself is impressed by, and then he mentions that he's a snackaholic suggesting that he has to spend a lot of money so he can eat. So.,, is he poor or not?*The implications of the Mother Box in the medical sector. You're telling me, Silas Stone was able to remake his son into an advanced weaponized computer system that can hack into any of the world's networks but that technology can't be used to make prosthetics? Superman was literally brought back to life from dust and bones, why the hell wouldn't he just use the technology to make his son whole again? Why make him into a supercomputer that will never be able to live a normal life because he now has access to knowledge no normal person should ever have access to? And what a reckless thing to do! Victor now can single-handily destroy the world at any moment both economically by manipulating markets and physically by initiating a nuclear war. It's insane! But on top of that, let's give him weapons and allow him to fly too.In conclusion, I never would have watched this movie on my own but I am glad I was with a group of friends that made this experience far more enjoyable than it had any right to be. This movie did not need to be four hours long and yet, it could still be longer if they decided to give Steppenwolf any development, allowed the heroes to interact and bond with each other more, and cut out some unnecessary stuff like the before mentioned Aquaman fisherman scene and the Wonder Woman bank scenes. But when all is said and done, even though I am not the biggest Zack Snyder fan, I am happy he won out over the studio. Hopefully, this starts a new age where studios start giving directors more creative control to show off their vision of the story.", "Respect Ben's Name": "Before this I hadn't seen Ben Affleck as batman in anything (apart for Suicide Squad where he does Jack) for like 5 years and I didn't remember much but I had started seeing him in a bad light on TikTok which made me remember him negativley and stuff but when I saw this, it made him instantley the third best batman. Respect for Benjamin.", "Lord of the rings of superhero movies": "The beautiful storytelling of this movie puts any of the other superhero movies of dc and marvel to shame..

Thank you Zack for making this possible.", "Must see 11 out of 10.": "To compare this to the first version is to compare the internet to a 70's encyclopedia Brittanica. 11Long...yes, but so worth it. So much more character development (see Cyclops and Flash), bonus ending and detail. Bring Snyder back now!I don't know how Warner screwed it's up, but thank to all of those who led the ground swell to get this released. Please do a sequel and patch it up somehow.", "Well done and well worth the wait!": "This version of the movie was well done and well worth the wait! I am so glad there was a vision to see Snyder's version through and bring it to the screen. I hope the team (especially the actors) will come together again and continue what they've started. Is there anyway possible DC can salvage this?", "Great action let down by bizarre creative choices": "Zack Snyder's skill for action directing shines through in several great sequences. Unfortunately almost every great moment has something to hamper it. These are typically smaller weird details that distract but sometimes it gets truly bizarre and affects the story such as cyborgs father sacrificing himself for no reason other than cyborg needed the character motivation. Many times actions taken will heavily contradict the narrative such as Batman supposedly learning from past mistakes and becoming a team player, while still acting like a selfish jerk in most scenes. Or my favorite, Aquaman berating a man for disrespecting the sea, then preceding to liter a broken bottle and his shirt into it to do a cool pose for the camera.Most of the early movie delivers decent world building and a great hero set piece for Wonder Woman, but there are so many disparate plot lines that much of the central momentum is lost. The latter half of the movie has a much better pace and focus, but Steppenwolf remains a weak villain. The inclusion of Darkseid creates a much better overlord villain, until the final sequence IMO, but Steppenwolf stills feels like a bland mini boss with minimal characterization.Despite my many criticisms though, and I have plenty that aren't listed here, the films action scenes are pure spectacle. Snyder's style shines in these moments, Batman's batmobile run towards the ending was phenomenal as were many other moments such as the Darkseid flashback and zombie Superman's fight against the Justice League.Overall the film seems to be an improvement, but it's successes contain endless caveats for me. Watch it for some good action scenes, but beware the bizarre inclusion of libertarian politics, Superman Jesus and mom wives that stop genocidal meltdowns. Please become more aware of how ridiculous this all is and embrace the campy action Zack, no one over 16 wants edgy Jesus Superman who dresses in black...... well except to laugh at of course.", "Absolutely Blown Away!": "This film is superior in every way when compared to the 2017 theatrical release. I was especially awe-struck by the villains, and the overall character development between the heroes. There's a definite and grand-scale vision being conveyed and it's truly a unique and awesome experience. Such an incredible movie!", "A hard slog": "I wanted to like this but it is very hard going. All star cast telling a nothing story. The bland characters and weak script don't help carry the movie's dark tone and washed out visuals. 4+ hours to bring this to a conclusion is WAY too much. There are a few parts where the movie gathers pace and is okay but you can guarantee the next grinding halt is also fast approaching. Going in with very\nlow expectations is my advice and you might enjoy parts of it.", "As a DC guy I really hate Snyder's vision of the DCU": "I just can't do it. Snyder gets almost all the characters wrong yet again. It's a problem that's started with MOS and Snyder ruining Pa Kent and it's extended to other movies like BOP ruining Cassandra Cain, Dinah Lance and Renee Montoya. Justice League is no different.\nSure it was some pretty slow mo fight scenes but that's all it excels at. Just like MOS's only redeeming quality was kryptonian fight scenes, I can say the same for this film.\nEven though it's 4hrs long I still feel he tried to cram way to much in. Like 3 movies worth of stories into one film (just like BvS.) the story falls flat still just like the other cut. The score and soundtrack are lackluster and depressing just like a majority of the movie. As a DC fanboy I wish they would just reboot this entire movie universe already and give us a product that matches the characters and makes them recognizable. WB doesn't know how to be true to the characters and have a successful product and it drives me insane.", "Epic Movie": "Wonderful characters development, and a payoff for the nightmare scene from the prequel.

What a shame that it will be the one and only justice League film. We can only hope another studio picks up the rights and continues with what now has potential to be a wonderful franchise, unlike the trash thrown out by Warner brothers.", "Make Zack Snyder the Head of DC/Warner Bros": "I just cannot believe how good this (version of the) film is.Without giving any spoilers, the best part about it is that each character is properly developed, taking their own time. Each of the action scenes are built up more than in the theatrical version. It literally feels like a completely different movie. Some characters have more of a pivotal role by the end than you'd imagine at the beginning.Some have pointed out that one of the negative points is the lengthy runtime. While it is a task to watch the whole movie at one go, none of the scenes are boring. You will be hooked on till the very last scene, I assure you.On top of this, I recently read that the ONE cut WB asked Snyder to make was to remove a scene with The Green Lanterns. One can only imagine how much better this movie could've been.This movie clearly shows that DC stories have huge potential, even if they are a stark contrast to the much lighter MCU. It is not an us versus them saga. It is properly exploiting the wealth of characters and stories each universe has.I humbly request WB/MCU Directors (Joss W.), and other Executives to stop interfering with the few, rare gems of storywriters/Directors you have in the DCEU, especially Zack Snyder. It is a shame that online bullying for his artistic choice was suspected to be the reason of his daughter's suicide. He still came back and made this cut for us, the fans.A lot of respect and heart going out to you, Mr. Snyder.This movie is excellent. Irrespective of whether you are a DC or Marvel person.

Eg - the Flash moments - its been done better in X-Men with Quiksilver. The boxes feel like a mix if MCU and Transformers! So it doesn't feel original.It is far better than the first version (but the isn't hard).

Well Zack Snyder has achieved this with his vision of the Justice League. Way too long getting the team together, mixed in with bad over the top CGI.

This is something that DC fans dreamt about since a long time. As a life long fan running after DC, it's such a disappointment what we got earlier(in 2017). But finally we abled to watch the Justice League in Zack Snyder's vision & it is splendid this way. I really hope that WB will let Zack Snyder to continue this version of his very own Snyderverse.

A 4 hour film that was cut down to 2 hours, with much of the connecting tissue excoriated and replaced with some very bad \"jokes\".The full four hour movie is well worth the wait, where the performances of the main cast is given the space to breath. Every character has purpose and meaning, even the villain of the piece, Steppenwolf. Who went from being a one note big bad to someone I genuinely felt sorry for. The main heroes of the film each have depth lost in the cinematic version, Ezra Miller's Barry goes from being one of the most irritating performances to one of my favourites with one of the best moments in comic book cinema. Gal Gadot's Dianna excudes strength and charm, ever a leader amongst her team mates. Jason Mamao has a fantastic moment of introspection you do not expect for the character in either the theatrical edition or his own Aquaman film. Ben Affleck's Bruce has not only some of the best lines but he feels like a connection to what the character was before the events of Batman V Superman, filled with reenhanced vigour. Henry Cavill's Clark Kent has the second best line in the film, and though only probably having 10m screen time his presence is felt through out the whole film. Of course I save the best for last, Ray Fisher turned in one of the best performances I have ever seen in a comic book film, where his despondence and grief are not just seen but felt, but he also graces us with one of the most uplifting moments too.The music by Tom Holkenborg matches the tone of the previous films released in the series, but manages to build on the themes created by himself and Hans Zimmer, a fantastic score that I had on repeat for nearly a month.Fabian Wagner did an amazing job on the cinematography, every scene is utterly beautiful. The film is not perfect, there are moments that maybe could have been trimmed, but they are far outweighed by the positives. If you saw the theatrical cut you have seen the plot, but only 40 minutes of what's in that film is in the 280 minutes of Zack Snyder's Justice League.Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio made a fantastic film, that should be seen by all. It is 4 hours, but the film is broken into chapters so you can split the movie up over a few sittings. If you wish to do this the best moment is 2 hours and 20 minutes into the film at the end of Chapter 4.", "Talk about an Epic Saga!": "This is an amazing movie I won't even acknowledge the previous movie now.

MUST WATCH.", "One of the Best Superhero Movies of 2021!": "After watching the Snyder Cut, I was instantly impressed by the visuals, the story, the action, the heroes and especially the villains. I was expecting it to be better than the 2017 Joss Whedon version which was terrible. The Snyder Cut was much better. There are no awkward jokes, no high color grading and no short runtime. The 2021 film has a perfect story especially for Cyborg whom didn't have any substance in the whedon version. And we get more character development for the Flash and Aquaman. And the villains in the 2021 film are much better. Especially Steppenwolf. He was butchered to a safe, generic and wanting to rule the world for no reason villain. Here he has a sympathetic motivation that makes you feel for him. And finally we have Darkseid! This film makes me want to see the rest of the Snyderverse restored on HBO Max. I do have some problems with the Snyder Cut like Wonder Woman's new and annoying theme song that plays every single time she is on screen and the Martian Manhunter posing as Martha which takes away the nice moment between Martha and Lois. This is where the positive outweigh the negatives. Perfect film 10/10.", "Did not disappoint!": "Loved it as much or more than Marvel. They definitely now have a run for their money. Awesome film, couldn't stop watching. Perfect ending!", "The only Extended Universe that matters starts here...": "Incredibly enough, the first 15 minutes of ZSJL, where you can't see anything but a series of beautifully developed shots in slow motion, is in itself light years ahead and better than the entirety of \"Josstice League\".We are served with a valid storyline straight away and when something happens, during the entire movie, you can actually say it has a reason. Things wouldn't just happen as it's the case in the first franken-film. Story is gripping, interesting and a great continuation of the universe set in the first two movies. Acting is way better as the actors weren't forced into unnecessary re-shoots, CGI is amazing, albeit there are parts where it's a bit choppy, but all in all - this feels like a \"thank you\" from Zack to fans and yes, we want more!The \"Josstice League\" is an abomination and it should be erased from the existence. The king is back, long live Zack Snyder! #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Wooow,. Just wooow,.": "This review I'm writing after the 5th time watching ZSJL. WOOOOOW. Just woooow. This is what we were missing from DC. This is DC. Snyder verse must be restored.No one understand comic characters deeply than Zack Snyder. Everything fits right into the core.Wooow...", "Zack's magnum opus": "Perseverance, hardworking and a little support from our loved ones are the key ingredients to success. Zack has shown us that.Let's talk about the movie, I must say that Cyborg is the heart of the movie, indeed. It is such a wondrous sight to see the emotions conveyed through the cyborg's backstory. Every actor outshines. Ezra Miller as Flash is perfect and this time the jokes pack their punch. Gal Gadot redeems herself in the role of Wonder Woman like never before. And to address the elephant in the room, Superman emits calming energy to the existence. Aquaman played by Jason Momoa is badass as always. The most important part of a superhero movie are the supervillains. Steppenwolf, who serves as the primary antagonist is more relatable than before and this is also the first time that we see the legendary supervillain Darkseid and his minion Desaad.The movie boasts a 4:3 aspect ratio which is unique in the way that the viewers pays attention to a more closed space as it helps to delve into the characters more. Also, the post-production of the movie was completed in 7 months that too in the middle of a pandemic. Never did I find any visual flaw while watching this and every computer-generated subject looked polished to the max. Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL's background scores were great. This was also Junkie's first solo DC outingLastly, I must say that this movie is a perfect example of how a comicbook movie should be, both visually and emotionally.The seeds have been planted. Now, we wait and nourish it so that the roots go as deep as they can go and make this into a strong beautiful tree. Lets restore The Snyderverse.", "Satisfying": "After the original being same corny and disapointing. This version nailed it with visuals, dark and violent like it should be. Pricing together a great story out of the jumbled mess of the original", "Nice try.": "Better than the first, still stupid and boring af.\n4:3, really?\n4hrs, really?\nBen Affleck, captain bringdown, the destroyer of franchises, really?\nJared Leto, really?\nCGI, geesh, even the horse riding looked fake...\nNo, nice try, but no.", "This is the masterpiece": "I think wb needed to continue the Universe. Cz this Movie is really a masterpiece. An expected movie what we really want.", "FILM REVIEW: Zack Snyder's Justice League": "I got a chance to see this film before most others thanks to the fact that I won the Heroes Among Us Sweepstakes by putting up a video of myself talking about how much I love my mom, and comparing her to Wonder Woman in the way that she is one of my heroes. So, last night, my family and I got the chance to sit down and watch all two-hundred-and-forty two minutes of this epic film.The film stars Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher as Cyborg, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Steppenwolf, Ray Porter as Darkseid, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta, J.K. Simmons as Jim Gordon, and Jared Leto as The Joker. The synopsis is: \"In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman's (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf (Hinds), DeSaad, and Darkseid (Porter) and their dreadful intentions.\"The film is truly epic from beginning to end, and it did not let up in its action or its many twists and turns. The story is actually given time to be truly complex, going from character and revealing their current predicaments and feelings as the events unfold. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and even though it was a four-hour film, it went by so quickly.The cast helps this story greatly, with the performances of Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, and Ezra Miller as the main heroes being three-dimensional and emotional, and the rest of their cast, like Hinds as main antagonist Steppenwolf, Amy Adams and Diane Lane as Lois Lane and Martha Kent, respectively, Jeremy Irons as Alfred, and Ray Porter as secondary antagonist Darkseid.The visuals have greatly improved over the theatrical version, where nearly ninety percent of the film was reshot after Snyder had to step away due to a family tragedy, and they are awe-inspiring, with characters like Cyborg, Steppenwolf, and Darkseid looking extremely real and as good or even better than some of Marvel's visuals.\nThe score by Junkie XL (credited as Tom Holkenborg) is truly a Mount Everest of scores, as he described himself. It contains the epic moments, the emotional moments, the dark moments, and the happy moments, and improves each and every scene, with all the character themes and the \"Foundation\" themes being my favorites (more on that in the next few days).And finally, the direction is just great. Zack directed every scene with a well-thought plan, and it fits every scene, from the action to the tragic, exactly as it should be.\nIn conclusion, after waiting nearly four years for Zack's true vision of the film, everything has worked in his favor, and this film is truly amazing. As hard it is to believe, this has surpassed Avengers: Endgame as my top comic book film, and I can't wait to watch it again once it hits HBO Max! Thank you, Zack Snyder, and everyone else who made this a reality! (Rating: 10/10)", "Great Film! One problem.": "Amazing film much better than the first one! But the only thing that ruins it is Jared Leto as the joker.", "\"Zack Snyder's Justice League\"": "In this new cut of justice league there is even more unnecessary, and tedious slow-motion.When it comes to the DCEU I'm not necessarily a huge fan. Their movies are all just as dull, and cookie cutter as the last, and are not at all as fun as DCs contemporary, Marvel. When I decided watch the original justice league before this one, I had no idea how 2 more hours of this movie would save it. Now that I've watched both, those 2 extra hours of the movie made it such a tedious watch. while I will admit the movie is better, it still feels like a somewhat consistent justice league with a more boring, uninspired backstory.Positives:\nI do believe there is a some amount to respect and appreciate about this movie. Zack Snyder getting to create what he set out to make is pretty admirable, especially to how ambitious this movie is. It really felt like Zach wanted to maintain some artistic integrity. This movie definitely felt epic and grand in scale And had a lot more emotion and weight than the original. now does that mean I cared about anything, no, But it definitely had more of a foundation and story than most DCEU films do.Everything Else:\nThis movie is a HUGE Mess. The color palette was almost just as stale and as Nauseating as Batman V Superman, and paired with the horrendous CGI it made for a visually repelling experience. It felt like was watching an unfinished movie that was just starting to Implement computer graphics. Amy Adams has to be one of my favorite actresses working today and the way her character was treated felt like they really could've remove 90% of her scenes and nothing would've change. There is a whole lot of fat to trim that was torture to sit through. From the overabundance of slow-motion to the unnecessary exposition. 25% of this movie really could've been cut out. Cyborg was such a boring character and his backstory just felt like a parody of the traditional superhero backstory, And now that I mention it, all of the character were incredibly dull and boring. Steppenwolf could've been replaced with a toaster and nothing would change. His motives where so basic and forgettable that I wondered if they just used a script generator to write this story. The end was just a huge CGI fight that was just so hollow in its emotions and feeling, and the epilogue just felt like a commercial for their upcoming movies.In Summary:\nI guess in the end this movie was made for the fans, and if you like I don't blame you really. I guess personally I would like more talent and competency in the helms of the writer and director. I can still very much respect Zack for what he decided to do for the fans, and based on the audience ratings he did well.3/10", "Ehh.": "Some cool parts but overall disjointed (even with 4 hours) and disappointing.", "The Snyderverse must keep going up up and away!": "Zack Snyder shows that Justice League 2017 was a big mistake from Warner, Emmerich, Geoff Johns and ALL executives from Warner. Warner Media and HBO Max must immediatly bring back Snyder to the work, before he assigns a exclusive contract with Netflix or Marvel Studios. #restorethesnyderverseonceandforall", "Faithful comic creation": "Finally a film that is not a money-making work. Not only was the film itself a real refreshment but the presentation of the characters was excellent. Last but not least, we know that this movie was made for fans. Huge gratitude and thanks to Zack Snyder!", "Honestly didnt think it was that much better than first": "I guess I was kinda disappointed because was hoping to see Darkseid fight,Definitely was better than first but also was much longer so makes it a bit harder to compare I guess, more length means more chance to incorporate cool thingsA lot of the fight scenes were mostly the same, better but eh, definitely seemed like a bit of a consulted mess and can see why didnt make it to theaters, kinda hard to cut that down to a Normal movie length size, 4hrs is much longer than what movie theathers normally put out", "Well Done Zack !": "Initially i was quite skeptical...But after a 4hour viewing..My view on this movie totally has CHANGED ! I got to agree with majority that this is by far the BEST film by Zack Snyder with Justice League !! Really Professional and Great Great Characters.... I am looking forward to Part 2 ( Hopefully there is :-) )", "Love Letter to DC fans": "A beautifully crafted chef d'oeuvre that surpasses expectations. Brilliant cinematography, great score, epic fights, emotional storytelling and character developments. A love letter film to DC fans that makes you want more.", "Snyder exceeded my expectations": "This cut is an ideal example on how someone (studio or a director)can creatively screw up another director's vision. This trilogy of MOS, BVS and JL had to be presented through the eyes of none other than Zack Snyder.

If Snyderverse continue then everybody at WB is incompetent and should be fired.", "Bigger, better, and epic.": "This is the cut Snyder fans & DC fans have been waiting for: 'Zack Snyder's Justice League'!The cut is much bigger than the 2017 theatrical / Whedon cut and it's more mature to watch.Better visual effects, bigger cast, bombastic music by Junkie XL, the violence is more tougher than the original theatrical cut from 2017, longer scenes, epic cinematography, and more to see!'Zack Snyder's Justice League' is one epic version you won't want to miss!", "8 but not because it's great": "Being a massive DC fan I feel like it's necessary to state that this movie is pretty mediocre.First off, Zack Snyder is like a B-Movie director that somehow keeps getting big Hollywood budgets. His use of slow motion, poor choreography, horrendous CGI and a constant barrage of theme music is exhausting. It's something I can't look passed.It hurts my soul that Marvel can get the look, feel and cgi right in everything they do and DC is still living in the dark ages by comparison. DC/WB graphics team need to be fired. This was basically the quality of a video game. And with the added production time and budget we would expect something new, fresh and a massive boost in quality... didn't happen.All that being said, I give it an 8 only because of my love for DC. There are quite a few exhilarating parts for DC fans and several Easter eggs.", "Directors Cut": "That's the directors cut of the movie I want to see in the theatre.\nO hope that is a lesson of learning believe into the directors vision.\nAfter Sense8 the fans show how successful can be a vision and story movie.

Not action and gadgets.\nThis director version are an fist on the studio and producers who not looking out of the box.The most important and are also, from my point of view, to restore the Snyderverse and show us - the movie lover, the DC fans - the rest of his vision.\nThe success of this movie dictate the direction.\n#RestoreTheSnyderverse", "This is REAL Justice League": "Warner hear Zack Snyder's Justice League fans and restore Justice League and the original cast", "Dark and Brilliant": "Now this is the movie fans wanted.The movie is very very very engaging,have a lot of loose ends,leaves behind a lot of questions and as for the credits I would rather say Yes or No.They way new characters are introduced and the movie is directed is just brilliant.\nJust give it a go,its totally different from JOSSTICE LEAGUE.", "Amazing, but the Aspect Ratio": "I know what Snyder said. He filmed it and intended it to be viewed in IMAX Ratio. That was an awful idea since a lot of IMAX theaters are closed due to the pandemic, and the majority of us now own flat wide screen TVs. I did not get a 4K QLED TV for a full frame ratio. Yes, Wide Screen cuts off 1 inch from the top and bottom. But that is much better than 6 inch black bars on the left and right side. I rather see more of the sides than the sky and ground. Other than that, I loved it. There was some weird stupid moments in it, like Flash's introduction scene and a few others. But I really enjoyed it.", "Why can't DC do it right?": "DC deserves more Nolan and less Synder. Please... WB... hire someone better to helm these.", "Come on!!!": "Listen! I get we all hate joss Whedon because he was horrible....but this is basically 86% THE EXACT SAME MOVIE!!!! Oh and it's 2 hour longer? So please....

And finally a dark serious JL just like BvS", "Boring, slow and way too much superhero poses": "I waited a lot out of this movie after reading tons of opinions about the movie. But it really was the biggest disappointment of all time for me. The first two hours were really slow, the secenes were overly lenghty, the slowmotions were all over it and there were a lot (and i mean A LOT) superhero poses. Most of the added material was there because of the atmosphere, i get it, but for me it just made a bad movie even longer.However, the second half of the movie was decent, allthough it was not spectacular in any means. The actions scenes worked well and the overall storytelling tempo was good.But all in all the movie was little bit too black and white for me without the colors of greyness. Ok there was some try to gte the greyness in the movie through every heroes personal struggle, but I didn't find it too well composed. All that seemed a little bit added on and I didn't really get, how it made the story of the movie any better because it didn't really affect anything. But then again what else can the age of heroes be than the battle between the good and the evil?Snyder seems to be some kind of cult director among the DC fans, but for a non fan the greatness just do not open up. And I'm sorry about this, because I really wanted it to be great.", "Delete 2017 !!": "Thanks God that I got chance to delete 2017 version from my memory.\nThank you Zack !!

WB, DC films whoever it was that said they didn't want this movie and instead hired Joss Whedon to rewrite and reshoot this film made the most colossal mistake in superhero history and that includes Halle Barry signing on to Catwoman. The movie was shot, it was being edited! It's too late to say, \"we want to go in a different direction.\" My guy WHAT?! The bell has already been rung. You just spent $400mil on this and you expect Zack or Joss to just reshoot a completely different film in a few months?? This film makes it clear Zack Snyder needs to be made the Kevin Feige of this DCEU. Let him build the pantheon with free reign. Make these movie more connected and let them be epic with a scope Marvel will never be able to match.", "Joss Whedon release is better": "There is so much useless additional content in this version. Absolutely annoying slow-motion effect on almost every action sequence, and even non-action sequences. 4 hours of my life I'll never get back.

No doubt the length of this movie is 4hrs. But you don't get bored for a second. The direction of Zack Snyder's is to good.\nMust watch movie", "Different To The Original, Not Much Better": "Hello From Here - I am so surprised at the 9s & 10s being thrown at this reworking of the original Justice League. There has definitely been enough time, comments made and input for this new version to take on Marvel's Avengers, shine brighter than Sony's Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, but it simply is not at that level.Zack Snyder's Justice League adds a great deal. It is darker, slow burning with a story more focused but sadly this does not add up to a superior film over the original. The energy and genuine fun parts of the original are cut here. What's added makes for a film that comes across as trying to be brooding & dramatic but pales in comparison to the dark gritty feel of Christopher Nolan's amazing Batman trilogy. There are some great new touches, the best being scenes added for the Flash. These are then offset with unnecessary extra scenes for Aquaman & Cyborg that add little but more runtime.I keep feeling I have missed something when reading such high reviews from others. The truth is Zack Snyder's Justice League is only marginally better than the original. It is different, darker, much much longer, but this does not make it vastly better. If you're a fan of superhero movies then you won't miss this, it's an OK watch. If you're new to superhero movies then head to other titles I mention above to start your journey.", "Much better than First justice league": "I think Warner bros should add zack snyder before every DC movies if it lead to makin this. It is better than all other movies combined", "Every scene is a total bliss!": "I won't lie, at first I thought this movie will torture me to death, I mean it's 4 hours long! But believe me, this feels like a ride. An epic, wonderful ride. The problem with the theatrical cut was that it didn't much seems to be connected with the DC Universe, it was more like a standalone, seperate movie. But this film, OMG it's what complete Snyder's triology (Hoping to see his entire vision in the future) it gives all kinds of references, Easter eggs, all things a fan can expect from a superhero universe. At the end, I would like to say what every DC characters fan wants, please WB, listen to us fans and #RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE", "A masterpiece 9.7/10": "An absolute tour de force. I've always been a fan of Marvel and DC but had more of a preference towards Marvel. I always thought the DCEU had an unfair rep by the general public and was definitely rushed and meddled with by Warner Brothers. I absolutely loved Man of Steel, was extremely mixed on Batman v Superman, and said I liked the theatrical cut of Justice League at the time of its release. I knew the theatrical cut was bad but didn't want to admit to myself of what I'd seen but after seeing the movie a few more times and talking about it I realized how much of a disaster it was.I was never really sure if the Snyder Cut was real but I was so happy the fans were rallying behind a director and raising awareness for suicide prevention. Hearing more and more about what the movie could've been and hearing what the cast, crew, and Snyder himself were revealing about the movie and the state his footage was in, I felt the possibility that the Snyder Cut could exist or at the very least be incomplete.I was delighted to hear that the movie would see a release on HBO Max and that Zack Snyder had full creative control. From the very opening scene of this movie, I was blown away. For four hours straight, I was completely locked in. The streaming format and the different chapters made the four hours fly by, not to mention the extremely engaging story and likable characters made for a much stronger movie that we got in theaters in 2017.There were a few little things that I didn't like but those are spoilers and they're such nitpicks honestly that I feel guilty even mentioning it. I loved this movie, all 4 hours of it and I watched it a second time to make sure it wasn't just the hype and it wasn't. I'll most likely be watching it a third and fourth time, and watch it more times after that. I'll definitely be buying this on bluray, I always felt guilty for not owning the Justice League movie but that's because up until now it didn't exist.This is my favorite movie in the DCEU, and I like it more than most MCU movies, and I say that as a bigger Marvel fan. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Leaves fans needing a 2nd movie!": "I've never been happier to sit through all four hours of this movie. I was so disappointed with the 2017 release. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Warner Brothers needs to find interest again, and allow another! #snyderverse", "Everything we all needed": "We didn't realize how many questions were left unanswered or the backstories we really needed. This movie did not feel like 4 hours, but it gave us every ounce of the movie that we deserved and everything we needed. I'm perfectly fine with 4 hour movies if that means we aren't left wondering wth happened to that person or who was that. Especially if I can watch it at home, I mean we're all watching 7 hours of TV shows at home anyways. Ya this was amazing and perfect. It was dark but not too dark but fit the DC tone completely and not overly comical like the original played out. I just, I loved it. It was just great, this movie also gave me better Vibes for wonder woman than 1984 did. Just grab your popcorn and snacks and go watch it.", "Snyder Cut? More like Snooze Cut": "It's amazing how bad this movie is, the dialogue sounds like it was written by an emo teenager,such cringey dialogue. So many moments where the characters reveal their secret identity. There's a whole Nordic town where that famous billionaire is obviously the Batman, what about all those cops and soldiers that saw Clark Kent rise out of Superman's grave? Then there's that lady with the head band who's looks a lot the that girl at the museum. Literally every scene is cluttered with clunky dialogue even 12 year olds roll their eye at. Queue Wonder Woman giving a thumbs up and saying something inspirational to little girls everywhere. Why is a depressing Lois Lane with absolutely no character in this movie other than to remind Zombie Superman that he's a really nice guy? Why does Batman wear a trench coat over his bat suit IN THE DESERT!? Did I mention how dumb the dialog is? Why do Amazon's wear sexy armor that leave their supple, supple flesh exposed? Why does Snyder love slow motion sooo much? Does he think he's still in the 80's? The story is just an excuse to pull these people into a movie. The visuals are great, but that alone does not make Snyder a visionary, this is bad story telling. The action scenes are boring and muddy. I like super hero movies but are we all watching the same movie? This is not a good film it just looks good visually. Sad.", "Zack Snyders Justice League": "A mesmerizing, fantastic masterpiece that is even more phenomenal for the fact it didn't have the stable foundation the Marvel's movies built up before shooting something of this scale.The sole thought that brings me regret is that perhaps, even if Zack Snyders did get to finish the movie for theaters as he wanted, there is no way it'd have been at this length. For it to work at a typical length for this type of movies, it first and properly needs to establish the foundation for each character.Either way, now it's all patched up and ready for the next stage, if only everyone involve would give it the chance.", "That's all we needed": "This film is exactly what we needed and thanks to the effort of the fans, we got it.

THX \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd18", "A True Masterpiece!": "This movie is a masterpiece. It might be one of my favourite comic book films of all time. It's certainly in the TOP 3.The way the characters develope from beginning to end and tie into the story with every character taking a crucial part in moving the plot forward. One of my favourite moments is the speedforce moment with the Flash near the end. I will go into further detail on what I like and dislike about the movie.* THE STORYThe story is more or less the same from the 2017 movie. I had no problem with 2017's plot other than the fact that the characters felt like dull puppets and that there was no lore or any sort of low end to support the front line plot. In this movie however, all of that is offered in detail. The characters are explored, aswell as the history of Darkseid and the earth. This makes the stakes higher and makes you care for what's going on.* THE CHARACTERSThis is a character-driven story, meaning that the story builds upon the characters and wouldn't be a story without them. And EVERY character inside of the Justice League gets developed to their maximum here. Cyborg operates as the heart and soul of the movie giving it life and emotion. Superman's arc from Snyder's previous two movies is contiued with this part of his story being my favourite. Aswell as The Flash, Batman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman. We all get to see their perspective on the situation and they all have something to offer to the great battle.* THE VILLAINThe importance of a great villain and a threat in a movie is significant. They make Steppenwolf such an interesting villain in the way of bringing Darkseid onto the screen, looming in the background. Which just makes every scene with him so menacing. Every encounter with Steppenwolf is intense and his new design actually makes him look powerful and menacing.* The soundtrack. Almost all of the music from the previous version of this movie was replaced with Tom's and Hans's OST and it's beautiful. Everything from the Wonder Woman theme to the Superman theme as he flies toward the sky in his black suit to The Flash's OST as he runs through the speed force in an attempt to revert time to even the Justice League's MAIN soundtrack that plays as they prepare for the great battle. Every OST in this movie is - and is used, perfectly.* THE PACINGthis movie's pacing is strange to say the least and was made 4 hours long to be divided into 6 parts. The pacing for me felt very slow but never really ruined the feel of a scene. It felt, natural. Meanwhile the 2017 version felt rushed all throughout. I feel like the movie used every scene necessary for a well developed film.* The action. How they executed every single action scene in this movie was amazing. Every scene was shot beautifully of course, as to be expected by Zack Snyder. Every action scene uses itself of great CGI and Soundtrack, while still making us care for the characters in it. Brilliant.There were of course some stuff I did not enjoy the most, for example how Barry Allen's character acts and is trying to be quirky, it doesn't really fit the dark tone of the movie in my opinion. But that is just a small nitpick that doesn't impact the greater story being told.This movie is a masterpiece, an imperfect one at that, but still a masterpiece. I will need to watch it again for further inspection and thoughts but at the moment I love almost everything about it. My favourite parts being the characters and the Darkseid story.What I'm hoping for in the next installment, if there ever be one, is for the atlantean and amazonian armies to reinforce earth and give us a full scale Lord of the Rings style war against Darkseid while he searches for the anti-life equation similar to what we saw in the history lesson scene. While also giving us the Green Lantern as teased in this movie aswell as the Martian Manhunter, whom was even showed, twice.I rate this movie 9.2/10 - AN IMPERFECT MASTERPIECE.", "Best ,huge thanks": "From now on i want all the Justice League movies to be like this one ! Thank you Zack for making this long ,you just made it right by every character give it the spot light to each other !

But all he did here was prolong the pain and essentially dupe us all.Surely this is as subjective a statement as it gets, but I can't get on board with any of these characters no matter how hard I try. They are flat, boring, and I feel awkward watching them exist in their universe.DC needs to take a long vacation and then circle back with another approach in four or five years.", "very good movie": "Excellent action scenes and very good storytelling.", "A long awaited masterpiece.": "Infintely better than the theatrical, there isn't a single thing I didn't love about this movie. I hope we get to see Zack Snyder's Justice League 2 #restorethesnydercut", "A classic!": "The difference between this and the original goes far beyond just adding in deleted or unused scenes. It's a whole other beast and the DCEU would be very different today if they'd released this originally. It is genuinely a VERY good movie. It has real character and depth. Zack and everyone involved should be proud. Easily one of the best superhero movies period.", "A new age has come... Dawn of the bots!": "Now that bots can write reviews who needs actual viewers? Who cares about real people's opinions? Just give a million, a billion, a zillion 10's on computer and people will watch it, you make money and money matters.If you are dumb and cant find two great movies to watch instead of a longer Justice League maybe you should go back to school and start reading good stories to develop your imagination, study mathematics (logic) to see the limitations of your ideas. Watching the fight of the Amazons defending the cube, I couldn't stop thinking \"One Punch Man\" is more realistic.", "Dc is better than marvel and always has been": "And this movie definitely does it justice ;). Highly recommend\nThe music was horrendous though. Especially that scene with the flash \u270b\ud83d\udc4e", "The justice league we deserve-and we need more of": "So after I've now watched the snyder cut I just need to talk about it.It is an experience, from start to finish, and the justice league we deserved back in 2017. Nearly every aspect of the snyder cut is better than the original one. The CGI is just another level, which is not difficult to be honest, but still a huge improvement.The characters are also a huge step up in comparison to the original movie, especially Cyborg shines through the whole movie, his character development is incredibly good and you can actually say that he is the heart of this movie. Furthermore Batman is not a bad comic relief anymore, instead he is a consistent improved character from BvS, which is my personal favorite Batman, because Ben Affleck fits perfectly in the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne.The humor in this movie in general is much more decent and funny than it was in the original justice league because it fits more to DC, than the very marvel-like humor in the first JL, there are less jokes, but the ones we get, really work.The story itself is much more interesting, complex and feels more emotional because you feel more with the characters. That is a side effect of the more interesting characters like Cyborg. The longer runtime definetly helps with the character development and time for the story, so it doesn't feel rushed anymore, like the first JL, where you felt that some part of the story was missing. And even though some people argue that the movie is too long I don't feel like this is the case, you just need to let you sink in the movie and the characters, but I also have to admit that you could've made the movie 30 minutes shorter, which would still fit the film perfectly and improve the movie for the average viewer, but as i said, it didn't bother me personally at all.The last thing I want to mention is that Steppenwolf finally is a solid villain, and looks MUCH better than before, has a better storyline, and gets a little bit more background with the appearance of Darkseid.For me Zack Snyder's justice league is an absolute 10 out of 10 movie, which leaves you back wanting more of it, and I hope that we get more, one day.", "omg": "This is the best dc movie ever!!!!!!!! i love it and want it on 4k", "Much Better Than the Original": "The movie was far better. The plot and cinematic quality was much more what I expected. It was a little lengthy, but I do believe it would have been trimmed for theaters if this was the actual release.

Snyder's Watchmen was far darker, and while I grant he tried to tap into it, it fell short. Darker was mostly a palette and lighting cue (night scenes, rainy days, etc.) rather than a mood. For someone incorporating a more Frank Miller Dark Knight Returns style Batman (and don't get me wrong - I think Ben Affleck did an admirable job as the aging Dark Knight from Miller's vision, though I've no doubt there are people who will adamantly disagree with me), he lost a lot of the nuance of those comics.To its merits, I have to say that I had no problem watching it from start to finish and did not feel like four hours of my life was lost - part of this was waiting for the dynamic to kick in perhaps, but I won't say I was entirely disappointed (though I am still trying to wrap my head around the Epilogue). I am excited for sequels involving Darkseid, and I am hoping that maybe a reboot of Green Lantern with someone a bit more serious for Hal Jordan but with his cocky and sardonic sense of humour (Jeffrey Dean Morgan anyone?) will come out soon (though in this climate, they will likely go the John Stewart or Jessica Cruz route), and of course Martian Manhunter, Hawkman, and the rest of the JL crew.If you saw the 2017 version and hated it, give this a chance. It may very well right the wrongs you witnessed back then. If you haven't seen it, then again, give it a chance - it's Covid time people - not like we don't have more time on our hands, right?", "Beautifully Build-Up Story !": "A beautiful character build up with a solid storyline!\nhat's off Jack Snyder!\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "What Justice League should have been..": "They should of trusted Zach Snyder.

Felt how tired Batman has become.The DC world would of been born.What a missed opportunity.", "The movie the fans deserved. Well done Snyder.": "The film we wanted, and the film we deserved. Didn't feel like a four hour film as the content was al so exciting to be seeing for the very first time. The back stories for the characters and the emphasis shifting between main antagonists made it truly edge of the seat viewing. Watching it all in one go is the best way to watch the film. Overall amazing and if we can get the full snyderverse that would be amazing.", "New VFX but same poor story line, weak villain and no future": "It had some few actions sequence but few poor vfx too.\nVillain was madeof plastic which can be defeated by only superman who is made of steel.\nWonderWoman was so powerful(wonder woman 1), where she defeated Aries, but in this she can even defeat stephenwolf.\nIts was boring , - ( Wanna be like 1st avengers movie).DC is ruing everything . M a very big fan of SuperMan but this is insane.", "The Best DC Movie Ever, Period.": "There's not a second of 4 horus I did not enjoy in ZSJL. All the characters are equally treated and given the necessary importance for the story in their unique way. Not just the heroes even the villans are playing an important role in the Snyderverse. You will feel like there are some parts which are similar to 2017 justice league but don't fall for that the aspect ratio, the beautiful color grading and surprisingly the more meaningful dialogues of those scenes will definitely carry you away form that feeling.

But Boy oh Boy I WAS WRONG..Zack really showed how he takes his DC approach so serious, paying attention to details, character build up, back ground link ups, and all what you can expect in such a star studded movie.I am happy that finally some justice was done to Justice League flagship.. And i really really hope WB let Snyder do the rest of his project..This movie really washed the bad taste that was left in viewers mouths from previous BS...Critics can go to hell with their bias opinions.. They might be too old to judge dark comic movies.. They should stick reviewing Kevin hart movies... Lol", "Zack Snyder Justice League rocks dude": "I really love the movie and the last scene was amazing #restorethesnyderverse", "Zack Snyder is a joke": "Half the film is needless slow motion scenes. Ben Affleck as Batman is out of place. Ben Affleck looks like he's more likely to fix his daughter's alternator on her car, than to be out \"fighting\" crime. Ben Affleck's gut looks like it's fighting gravity. Zack Snyder's darkened filter throughout the film made the white snow look greenish blue, and it's overkill. Superheroes should be presented in a way where children can watch without their parents needing to explain why America's most iconic superhero in Batman is using the F word during a superhero team up film. This film was blatant DC comics fan service. I love Batman & DC comics but obviously the Snyder crowd was jealous at Marvel's success and are overvaluing this redo of a film that is being vastly overrated. The acting from Ben Affleck was flat. Cyborg had no charisma. Gal Gadot has the acting ability of a 2 x 4. Jason Mamoa's coolest Aquaman scene got ruined with awful music. Superman was raised from the dead with a glowing cube, which is stupid as hell. The villain with kitchen knives as an outfit looked stupid. The Joker scene was pointless because it was just a stupid dream, pure pointless pandering fan service. Zack Snyder wanted to have Lois Lane & Superman give birth to Batman in a sequel (google it), and also wanted to produce a Lois Lane, Clark Kent, and Bruce Wayne love triangle. Zack Snyder hasn't produced a good movie since 300. This is a good movie if you erase all logic from your brain and all standards for acting & cinematography. I'd call the movie trash but that would be disrespectful to moldy bread & spoiled milk in the alley behind a recently closed grocery store.", "I liked the nightmare scenes I want to see that film not this generic story": "So we got here finally to see Zack Snyder's vision, fans were appeased which is not something that happens these days fans are usually called names for not liking things by mainstream media, which is stupid. Not a huge fan of Snyder's DCEU personally I believe it was rushed. I don't understand why we couldn't get the solo movies first and lead up to justice league. You got a man of steel movie then straight to Batman v superman which has both a Doomsday and death of superman stories within it, very rushed. All those three storylines need a solo movie, perhaps a trilogy. Zack Snyder is not subtle with his themes it was very obvious the Jesus and falling stuff it became a little cringe but admirable attempts at something. I've been continuously waiting for them to lead to an injustice story as this Superman is very flawed and doesn't seem to care about people in Metropolis when he flies into buildings because his father was a bad role model in his teaching of Clark. But fans say Superman is a good person which I believe he isn't. Batman was a dumb detective in BVS to which I didn't like but he at least did some good fighting lol. We even got a justice league forming story in batman v superman that's how bloated that film was and it failed at enticing audiences for more.Now onto the main event we have a justice League movie which we saw in 2017 but now we got one of the most irritating schizophrenic soundtracks ever made terrible music unlike the junkie XL BVS one which was great this one is irritating women screaming and moaning why? No idea, ask Zack he's the visionary. We have more character development I suppose but it's not enough for you to feel anything for cyborg when he loses his dad and that was already in the trailer that he passed so no surprise. This whole film felt like Avengers Assemble a 9 year old film that Snyder cut fans will probably hate being compared to and it's not even an improvement. I'm not a Marvel fan boy but there universe works better than DCEU it's broken and embarrassing. Hear we have loads of origin back stories shoved into a four hour film that has the generic villain with new dlc skin fighting to get mother boxes. It's the same movie just more action which doesn't improve the story it just stretches it out. Batman is supposed to be the best version of batman but what detective work does he do not much if any but he beats up people in a cool way great so just Snyder brains huh. I only want a smart story why is this so hard the animated DC movies make better sense watch those Flashpoint is an example. The nightmare scenes are short and good I hope I see that culminate into something but not in this film which is disappointing. It would have been nice to see how batman became the way he did but that's not going to happen. This movie left me feeling completely deflated, disappointed and underwhelmed I didn't find it much different both films had an identity crisis this one was long and in pan and scan lol. Masterpiece has been thrown which baffles me this is a bad movie the second time around iand it's longer.", "Epic Justice League": "Was amazed by the time given to these characters and creating an acyltual story.

Absolutely. Are there some really cool action scenes? You bet. Are the characters more fleshed out? Eh...kinda. Bats, Supes and WW don't have meaningful arcs in any capacity, but Flash and Cyborg are leagues above their alternate cut counterparts.That said, dear GOD Zack needs to learn to trim the fat on his flicks. There is no reason this needed to be 4 hours. Especially when a natural endpoint occurs almost a half hour before the credits start to roll (Supes ripping open his shirt). Cut out the Knightmare scene (whose only purpose is to set up a sequel that'll never happen) and the Luthor scene (same thing) and the Manhunter scene (again, same thing) and you may have a pretty decent, if unwieldy, superhero flick.Longer does not equal better, even if the movie has some standout moments (Speed Force, final fight, bank robbery). At least it's better than the Whedon cut.", "TRULY AMAZING!!": "I'm so happy we finally got the Justice League we needed.Im glad Zack was Able to finally show us his True vision.Every hour of the This Cut was Amazing.We got so much more of cyborg and Flash. we also got a little bit more Mera,which was pretty cool.We finally got to see Superman in his black suit and We got to See the Man Himself: Darkseid.Im also happy they fixed Steppenwolf and made him look like he's supposed look: big,scary,intimidating and Powerful.This one of the best superhero team movies I have ever seen since Joss Whedons Avengers from 2012. Cant wait to see Justice League 2.", "Restore The Snyder-verse.": "The movie is a masterpiece, Its everything a DC fan could dream of.An interesting and dark take on the Justice League and just the way it should be. Mesmerizing and satisfying story. All the characters are done justice with incredible character development. The action, score and cinematography are out of this world. The plot connects perfectly and a lot of unexpected things happen and it sticks to source material all the while. It contains easter eggs and references which make it even more fun to watch as a comic book fan. The attention to detail is just brilliant. It was an emotional rollercoaster, an entirely different and far more superior version from the 2017 cut.Its a testament to Zack Snyder's devotion and vision. A very ambitious project, captivates you for 4 hours(something not many films can do) and it very much deserves to be continued(sequel) as does Zack Snyder's vision as a whole. It is without a doubt one of the best comic book movies and a milestone in its genre and universe. How it took so long to get released and not get a theatrical release which it definitely deserved is beyond me but watching it was totally worth it and exceeded all expectations.A phenomenal movie overall and I think we can all agree now that its time to restore the snyderverse.

Marvel films are brilliant, I love them, but they're pretty much pick up and play no matter how invested you are but DC is lesser known (sorry DC fans) and requires some exposition which this film does wonderfully.

Only one thing: Ben Affleck is NOT Batman !!!", "Give the man his flowers!": "It's hard to undermine how meaningful this movie is. For us DC fans and for superhero movies fans overall, this is a major victory. Zack Snyder goes deeper on each hero's background (in different ways of course). To do this without the benefit of each super hero having his own movie before Justice League was released is commendable! What he has done in spite of bad planning of movie sequences, it's incredible.The camera angle, the special effects, the story telling... I loved this movie and I'll darn right sit through another 4 hours to watch it again", "This is not a movie": "Warner Brothers replaced Zack Snyder with another director half way through shooting the original. This is supposed to be Snyder's intended vision. Which turns out not to be a movie at all, but rather a mini series. A 4 hour long mini series, it's about 2 hours too long for a digestable movie.That's the biggest criticism: I could never finish this in one sitting. Too much of a chore.For what it is, a mini series, it's quite interesting. It's Batman and Superman, so it will always be interesting. Snyder is too obvious as a filmmaker, making this a flawed story. But it's interesting, and definitely worth checking out, spread over a couple of evenings.", "Mediocre at best.": "First up, I have not seen the Whedon theatrical version, so this is an honest appraisal of the film on its own merits, not a comparison.\nWay too long! You could easily cut at least an hour out of this without forgoing the backstories that were apparently absent from the original cut. Do we really need a 10 min slo-mo scene of Lois getting coffee???\nSome cool action scenes, but they're too few & far between at a 4 hr runtime.\nEstablishes several inconsistencies with the Aquaman film, which could have been easily fixed with some ADR & editing.\nWhy did Superman attack the others on his return? Why does he don the black suit? Why does Snyder think it's more important to show Diana & Alfred making tea than to include a brief scene explaining these points.\nGeneric villains who just want to destroy the world. Any significant Thanos-like motivation? Nah, they're just evil.\nIf you're a Snyder fan-boy you'll love this 4 hr extravaganza of self-indulgence. If not, you're time is probably better spent elsewhere.", "\"Faith Alfred, Faith\"": "Loved every single second of it, it was just beautiful. I have nothing further to say.", "Batman's redemption as well as the movie's": "This story tells why would the heroes come together and leaves us all hanging for more by showing us few more minutes of the Knightmare timeline.\nEach of the team member is shown equal importance and their backstory is given value.\nCyborg is the heart of the movie and Flash is just awesome.\nFlash is fast \ud83d\ude09", "A beautiful work of art": "The culmination of DCEU film doesn't get any better than this. Snyder's Cut surpasses many modern superhero films you will see these days.", "Twice as good as the cinematic cut but still flawed.": "I'm going to start with what I imagine is an unpopular opinion. Some of the reviews here are deluded. This is not an 8/10 movie and is certainly not a 9 or 10/10, don't be ridiculous. If you give a film like this 8, 9 or 10/10 where do you go with something like The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, Chinatown, It's a Wonderful Life, etc.Right now that's out of the way.This is really the only Justice League worth talking about, the cinematic cut is terrible and can barely call itself a movie as it tells the story so ineffectively.Despite its length the pace throughout the Snyder cut is pretty solid and the action scenes are really well done. I would say the characters work well together and the film really does portray their growth as a team well as the story progresses. I think the balance of story given to each character works well too, I know some people feel Superman gets a bit marginalised but we already know what he's about so I don't feel like this is a negative personally.Overall I would say it's really entertaining and delivers what you would expect from a superhero / comic book movie and it does create what could have been a compelling universe with the introduction of Darkseid.I'm going to end with some negative points to justify the (entirely realistic) rating of 6/10.1. It's 4 hours for goodness sake. Even with the good pacing, the duration is just too much. Basically Warner Brothers really failed to follow the blueprint of introduce the characters in their own franchises then bring them together for the team up movie. As such the story has to cram in establishing three new characters as well as the villain and the whole plot. I also feel there was a good 30 minutes that could have been shaved relatively easily, it felt like there were several unnecessary scenes that added little to nothing.2. There are other colours than black. I get that this is Snyder's schtick, but for goodness sake man add a bit of colour and lighting.3. Superman is too OP, I get that's the whole character but it just destroys any tension and even if Superman can't fix things The Flash can just go back in time and prevent it from happening. Like I said it just destroyed the tension for me in the way Superman and time travel was used in this movie.4. Jared Leto.", "I expected more": "Five minutes in and I'm not impressed. I'll start by saying that Jason Mamoa was probably the incentive for me to watch, and Jeremy Irons, of course.Jason Mamoa is not the greatest actor of our time, but who's really looking at his acting skills. He's at least interesting, though. He's got a great voice and presence, and then there's his good looks. I believe I watched him in Aquaman, but I have little recognition of that flick.Ben Affleck...Well, I've never been a fan since watching Good Will Hunting. Just not impressed at all, he has one expression in everything I've seen him in, so that's not acting. And as Batman? Not my cup of tea, so seeing him in Justice League is disappointing. I wonder if Zack Snyder would approve. Affleck is just like the Aflac commercial, boring and annoying. Sorry, not sorry.And then there's Amber Heard. Seriously? And yes, I'm writing this in the middle of the trial with her ex. Watched her manager claim that little miss Amber should have been catapulted to stardom because of this Mera role she had, reasoning that Aquaman was the biggest movie of all time. The manager believes that Amber is being kept out of major roles because of the lawsuits and negative press. Let's break this down. Honey, your client is a dull actress, only even considered because she (was) young, has blonde-colored hair, has blue eyes, and Hollywood thin. That's it, babe. Unless you add in who she was married to at the time. Tried to watch Rum Diary and realized the girl was grating on my nerves and realized it was Amber. Bad choice, plus apparently she doesn't have chemistry with Jason Mamoa, so bye bye girl.Gal Gadot, not bad but I haven't gone out of my way to watch her other roles either. She looks too much like Angeline Jolie here, which lowers her credibility for me. I hate bashing women in film, but let's face it, the really talented actresses don't always fit the cookie cutter mold that Hollywood pushes on us, and the less talented end up with their faces where they really don't belong. Again, sorry, not sorry.Ray Fisher/Cyborg - I don't get it. Is he that bad an actor or is it the character he's playing? He's another boring character that I would not miss if he weren't in the picture.And who cast Jared Leto as the Joker? He's just bad, really cringy. I'm so sad that Heath Ledger is gone. Jared Leto, yuck.I'm more Marvel supportive, and I realize that half of the Avengers family of movies are cheesy and not the all-time greatest (Thor..Dark World, for example), but that doesn't keep me from watching those movies pretty much every week. But the Justice League? It doesn't flow, and I'm biased.I'd have to say that the supporting cast is the glue that holds this movie together, if you can say it was held together. Joe Morton and Jeremy Irons may be the only ones who are bearable to watch for more than a few lines. And the extras at the pub!

I felt like being very tired after watching it for such a long duration.", "I can give max 3": "I have a really mixed opinion. The good thing: the music when Wonder Woman attacks really chills!

The villain looked like Thanos in Endgame except he had a different color. The fight scenes were poorly acted out, I wondered why they couldn't have done like the fight scene between Bane and Batman in Dark Knight Rises.

In saying that, I should also say this movie does a great job in developing all the characters and their reason for being. Zack Snyder's version is excellent in drawing the audience to the the vulnerabilities of each of his characters and why they behave a certain way.Zack Snyder's story and direction is by far the best thing DC has seen and I truly hope that this continues. I am dying to know what happens next in this universe. And I truly hope there is a JL 2 to follow.Though the movie was 4 hours long, it was truly justified and engaging.

What a colossal bloodbath of characters. The main story can very well be told under one hour but got dragged on for four excruciating hours.

I can't believe I gave this a chance.", "A Goddamn Miracle": "ZSJL is a four hour slog that follows pretty much the exact same story as the Whedon cut, but with more intros! And you know what? It's all the better for it. Cyborg is promoted to centre stage as the heart of the movie, integral to the plot of the Mother Boxes, and with his own troubles with his father and his identity to solve all at once. But he's not alone as Flash also enjoys a much more increased presence. He's still the designated comic relief, but he's so much more purposeful. He has a role in the action scenes, and he has his own arc as a young man maturing and learning what it's like to work with others. And most crucially, Steppenwolf and the New Gods of Apokalips enjoy the fruits of a ballooned runtime as well. Steppenwolf is a real force to be reckoned with, far more intimidating than he was before, with an almost complete redesign from head to toe, complete with highly detailed armour that moves and shifts with his mood. And while he's no Thanos, he's a far more compelling villain than he was before, with his own motivations that extend beyond mere world domination. He's badass and pathetic in equal measure, and the fact that was achieved without compromising either side is a testament to how much better he is here. Even the Atlanteans and the Amazons as societies in their own right enjoy further development, given their own opportunities to shine, and marking a significance between Aquaman and Wonder Woman.The story as a whole also enjoys the extra time to really dwell on every moment. Assembling the team is no longer the whole movie, or at least it goes through extra steps to get there, allowing each character to slow down and sit in our minds before thrusting them all together. It has been a regular point of contest people have had with the DCEU; that they should've taken the MCU route and given every character their own movie first; a point I vehemently disagree with. Team-up movies have existed and succeeded long before Avengers in 2012. Not every franchise needs its own sub-franchises to give all its characters the attention they deserve. Instead Snyder was clearly taking a Lord of the Rings approach; telling one massive story across multiple movies, and he needs that extra runtime to be able to do that. No-one watched the theatrical version of the Lord of the Rings and thought \"Yeah that was perfect and didn't need more added\", and the Snyderverse movies are the same. They need that little extra runtime, not multiple extra movies that derail the story being told.A prime example of this is in the Knightmare sequences. In BvS it comes out of nowhere and makes no sense, but I could tell almost instantly that this was a hint of more to come. I was willing to reserve judgement until that thread had been pulled. ZSJL comes along and pulls on that thread, giving us Darkseid, his initial invasion of Earth, and multiple flashforwards to the world to come. Flash telling Bruce that Lois was the key is relevant not only to bring Superman back from the dead safely, but also to prevent him from turning aggressive again in the inevitable success of Darkseid's invasion. Cyborg sees this when he connects to the Mother Box and sees the Knightmare future for himself, including Clark knelt over a burnt corpse, opening himself up to be manipulated by Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation. It all matters. It's all building to something epic. And if we were to ever see this story reach it's zenith, that Knightmare sequence in BvS would no longer be seen as confusing and irrelevant. Instead it would be laying the seeds of a sprawling epic to come. A hint of movies to come, tying everything together.But I do have some criticisms. As much as I love Snyder's work, as much as this is the movie I've been waiting nearly five years for, I am not blinded to its faults. Every aspect of this movie enjoys the extra attention afford by a sprawling runtime, except the movie itself. I'm no stranger to long movies (see Watchmen above), and in truth ZSJL is remarkably well-paced for a movie of this length, however it is absolutely too long and it didn't need to be. This could easily have been a three hour movie without sacrificing much of its emotional support or world-building. Too many scenes are still superfluous, like Jim Gordon walking through the office and being told about the Parademon attacks, or the entire Knightmare section of the epilogue put there just give Batfleck and Leto's Joker time on screen together. Other scenes could have trimmed the fat off them, like the Amazon defence of their Mother Box, or Barry Allen saving Iris West from a fatal car crash, or hell even the fantastic opening scene of Superman's death echoing across the world and awakening the Mother Boxes, or Cyborg exploring his newfound powers and helping a poverty-stricken single mother. Linked to this, there's way too much pointless slow-mo. Snyder freaking loves his slow-mo, and usually I enjoy his slow-mo, but here it often feels unnecessary and like artificial bloating of an already overlong movie. Slow everything down when Barry Allen goes speed force, that's fine, even if you are just focussing on a hyper close-up of a sesame seed, but giving Victor Stone's college football game a slow-mo shot every two seconds? The fact that certain moments like Wonder Woman deflecting the bullets from an automatic rifle are shown in real time to showcase how insanely fast she is, and are amazing for it, just makes the unnecessary slow-mo stand out even more. Used effectively it can bring attention to details otherwise missed, which is something Snyder is usually pretty great at, but not here.Another complaint I have is with the music. Tom Holkenborg is back and is a far better fit than Danny Elfman, but it still doesn't quite reach the sonic of heights of any other Snyder movie. The soundtrack has its moments, especially The Crew at Warpower and At the Speed of Force, and of course the reoccurrences of the Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, and Lex Luthor themes, but beyond that it's missing that special Zimmer factor. Holkenborg excels with the ambient background noise, but Justice League requires more. Where Man of Steel and BvS laid down such exquisite and instantly recognisable themes for multiple characters and moments, Justice League just doesn't. There's no Flash theme. There's no Aquaman theme. There's no Cyborg theme. There's no Steppenwolf theme. There's no Apoaklips theme. There's no Mother Box theme. Even the Knightmare pieces from BvS are absent from the Knightmare sequences in this movie. Not everything needs its own music cue, but Holkenborg doesn't really give us anything for any of the new characters, items, or moments of significance. Or if he did, they're so unmemorable that I can't even pick them out, and I've been listening to the soundtrack for the last three hours while writing and researching this review. The licenced music doesn't fare much better either, with every song feeling misplaced and wrong, and honestly with Man of Steel and BvS absent of licenced music entirely, it makes their inclusion here stand-out even worse.Visually ZSJL is everything you could want and more. Some of the CGI is a little shaky at times, but considering the circumstances that's hardly surprising. The fact that Steppenwolf comes out so well, especially when compared to the Whedon Steppenwolf, along with Darkseid himself (that shot of his hands through the dirt, god damn), is remarkable in itself and makes it easy to overlook every time an Amazon's horse seems to float an inch off the ground, or Cyborg's surprisingly wiry frame, or that godawful Joker make-up. Similarly some of the production values lack a little polish, like Diana meeting Cyborg on a street that's quite clearly a soundstage, or the cemetery with a bizarrely detailed backdrop. And then on the other side of the coin you have Batman's transport plane causing the water in the lake to ripple and get pushed out the way of the air being thrust below.Zack Snyder's Justice League is nothing short of a miracle. It's way too long and could've done with being trimmed, the CGI is as phenomenal as it is terrible, the music almost feels like a rush job, and yet it still far outperforms the Whedon cut on every single level (the only scene I actually missed was Aquaman sitting on the Lasso of Truth). The story is the same, just with...MORE. More characters, more details, more background, more interactions, more bad-ass action, more violence, more language, more sesame seeds, more heart and soul, and more Secretary Swanwick. Oh god damn Secretary Swanwick is back and offers the film's biggest surprise twist. Snyder the mad lad actually did it. You'll see. I give Zack Snyder's Justice League a miraculous 8/10, although I still can't believe this even happened. I'd have been happy even if this was a steaming pile, because all I ever wanted was for him to finish what he started all those years ago. Instead I find myself really tempted to give it a rewatch tomorrow.#RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Not enough": "There were improvements from the 2017 version, but not enough for me to enjoy the movie all that much.", "\"Evil does not sleep.\"": "There is so much going on and it is very apparent that this is the superior version. Cyborg and Flash get much more of a back story which makes it a much more cohesive story, which made me happy. I am curious how much Zack himself would've cut out since it would've not been more than 3 hours in theaters, but I am glad he got his total vision out there and there is something poetic about leaving people wanting more and not doing more comic book movies for Warner Bros.", "The Boring Cut": "For all the hype afforded this movie it remains dull as dishwater. Characters behavior is inconsistent scene to scene, the music is awful and the tagged on future apocalypse scene is like a cheap youtube fan film. The effects are of varying quality throughout (Lex Luthor clearly not being in water up to his waist is a stand out). Could have cut 90 minutes and not lost anything worthwhile. Better than the theatrical version but only just.", "It was cool, but not good enough to buy a dvd of it": "Not going to lie\nThe opening scene confused the heck outta me\nI haven't watched the originalWhen Diana prince pulls the guy up he just stays quiet ????Like doesn't yell to his friends for help?He just wants to be taken in peace?Hahahaha\nGet the f outta here\nThen this guy is going to spill the beans to her?Ooook cheesyBen, I'm happy your hooking up with jlo, she's fn hot!But please never play the b man again\nMaybe christian is free for the next movieThe Batman honesty doesn't make sense going up against these laser shooting flying robots\nLike Batman's armor can shield against lasers now?Come onThe cgi is as ok\nCould of been a lot worseSuperman comes back?!?Come on\nPretty cheesySo Superman cannot cut through the Batman's armors with his laser eyes but This giant warrior with alien armor gets melted\nOooookThe actor playing lex luthor is super annoying\nDoes not fit the partOverall it's a entertaining superhero movie\nI didn't hate it\nBut it's not better than dark knight.", "Bravo": "This movie is part blockbuster action, part fantasy epic and part somber allegory. Although not as layered thematically as BvS, it serves to show that epic sci fi can be smart and human without being surface level emotionally.A subtle anti suicide theme is present through out, especially in Cyborg's story. Couldn't help but see an emotional link between Silas and Snyder himself, even if this movie was shot before the Snyder's family tragedy.Been waiting for this movie my whole self aware life. Grateful for true artists like Zack.", "Still a sh** movie": "I thought Zach Snyder said that Joss Wheddon only used 10% of the footage he shot? Hahahhaha!! This was the same movie with more drawn out scenes (that added nothing else to the plot) and a pointless Martian Manhunter cameo. The last 30 minutes were the only thing worth watching this garbage for. Why the fu** would you choose to focus your story on a search for 3 boxes when The Avengers had already done 3 movies (at the time this was first released, 2017) based on a search for missing objects one of which is a box. Hahahahhahahah!! I know they've always copied each other (Deathstroke/Deadpool for example) but this is taking the piss. Speaking of Deathstroke, that was another pointless cameo. As was Jokers scene in a Bruce Wayne dream sequence?? Is Bruce Wayne a clairvoyant now? All in all it was still the same movie and could have been done in 2 hours.Zach Snyder is a nobody. I reckon anybody with any knowledge of DC comics could have done a far better job. I could have written a better script with both eyes shut and no paper. FACT!", "A masterpiece..": "Yes my friends it was worth the wait...what u'll witness is a director who adores his work and enjoy it so much that he makes every scene captivating visually, and auditary. A simple story..but adds the human factor in which makes it astonishing without forgetting how to please the hard core comic readers. This is truly a beautiful vision he had", "Zack Snyder likes his slow mo shoots": "Not as good as the Snyder fans boys say it is. Not as bad as critics say it is.Over long, a bit self-indulgent, very slow to get going. It is very watchable in places. But tbh I'm a bit bored of watching superhero films about Aliens coming to earth and trying to take over the world. However it it's 1000 times better then the original, but let's be honest my 6 year old son could have made a better movie then at.", "The TRUE Justice League!!!": "Joss Whedon and WB should be ashamed of themselves for even daring to think they could do better with that garbage version in 2017!!!This is how Justice League was intended to be and it truly is the definition of perfect!! All the character motivations are pronounced, the plot is developed, properly paced and lastly, the story actually has stakes now!! Darkseid is incoming and he will obtain his prize!!The score is infinitely better, the CGI is top notch and amazingly, it's even better than Avengers: Endgame!DC is back with a fury and as they have been for 80 years in the comics, the rivalry is back in full!!", "Just wondering and thrilling movie of the DC comics": "One of the finest movie of the DC Snyder Cut ,hope upcoming movies are also come out from this.", "Better than 2017": "Much better than 2017 version and clearly bigger universe in this version", "The Legend strikes back!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is the cinematic brilliance that every DC fan should adore for the rest of their lifetime. The movie is a spitting image of the original comics and there aren't any fancy turns that were taken by Whedon. The movie focuses on each and every character and adds importance to it.Tom Holkenborg strikes gold with his magical composition that stuns and thrills every scene. This movie is an excellent farewell to the DC community and the Legendary Fanbase that DC had for the past century. Undoubtedly, the best movie that mankind can ever have.", "Amazing but...": "It would have been a 10 if not for the presence of AH. Otherwise really good movie!! Wasn't bored considering it was 4 hours long!", "Pretty good overall despite the details in this review": "The film wraps up nicely and ends up more developed and more fulfilling than the theatrical version. The color and redesigns make the movie look so much better, but the 4:3 ratio is distracting for the first hour, just making you with it was filmed in 2.35:1 or at least 16:9. By the end of the movie, you're just proud of your self for sitting through 4 hours of straight up film. And it's devastating to think that the next chronological movie is the first suicide squad. Imo, it's tragic that this movie's first months or even years will be a comparison to the original with no reviews as it's own film. And after that, it will be film that's hard for the casual fan to watch solely because of it's runtime", "The other Justice League was just to make the MCU look better": "This directors cut is long but it puts all the inconsistencies of the other one to rest. Full character exploration and a terrific story to boot.The best DCEU film by far", "GREATEST DC MOVIE OF ALL TIME, HANDS DOWN!!!": "I don't know what else to say besides, a sequel (rather a SERIES), based on this movie, would cause me to go homeless. Why? Because I'd throw every single CENT I had at it, to watch it as many times as possible!!!", "This one is much better then previous one.": "Well done! Jack Snyder, If this version of justice league was released in theatre, fans would not have disappointed with DC.Although this time duration is too long that's 4Hr. But still i enjoyed watching it, it was better then the theatrical version.", "This is justice league!!!": "Loved the movie. I remembered the day when hbo max announced it . I screamed that day loudly and why not, being a fan u expect the filmmakers to respect our feelings.\nAll the scenes was beautiful portrayed. I loved amazonians , atlanteans scenes. I love all the mentions and screen time of darkseid. I love the design of steppenwolf.\nThis movie showed the real team work unlike earlier version where their main focus was to ressurect superman instead of fighting the villain themselves. I found batfleck badass in this movie and I am glad snyder cut the awkward scenes between WW and batman. That diana and steppenwolf scene was so dark and another reason to love DC. Flash was also way better than earlier versions with cool powers which he actually used in the movie.Knightmare scenes ufff!! I mean it was totally breathtaking . I want sequel badly . I can't get over martian manhunter . I want more of him.Well Pls restore the snyderverse. It's high time to demand for it. #Usunited can do anything.", "This is the way": "This should have been the first version of this film. Hope Warner takes some notes and continue the DCEU following this path.", "Fanboy movie / Aspect Ratio = 0 stars": "I'm going to be in a minority of one with this short review, but that doesn't worry me too much...\nThe film itself is brilliant - but overlong. 3 hours would have been enough. Too much padding.It's another Marvel movie, plenty of action, tons of CGI.Generally, the kind of movie I love.However...\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio SUCKS.For me - the movie was ruined.I was so looking forward to seeing this version.I now just feel the overwhelming need to share my disappointment regarding Zack Snyder's choice to present the movie only in 4:3. This decision ruined is completely distracting. Yes I've read all the adoring fanboy chatter waxing lyrical about his 'vision' of how it should be seen by audiences blah, blah, blah.... what utter claptrap!It's a widescreen movie condensed into to a square box. So 1970s.Especially now when we have no cinemas to go to, and all we have is TV - this decision makes no sense. (I watched this movie on SKY).Zack, the world has moved on from 4:3 aspect to 16:9 because it's an old format and widescreen is a more immersive cinematic experience. This is such a retrograde step. It begs the question, why did you not go the whole ten yards and make it black and white as well? Anyway, there it is.I felt cheated.The movie I looked forward to - RUINED.If a compressed small screen with black edges is your thing, well - fill your boots.As for me, I have no more to say.", "Not a great improvement over the cinematic version": "When I saw the original Justice League in cinemas I was pleasantly surprised. It was better than I expected. But after Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad my expectations were fairly low. Justice League was not a great film perhaps but enjoyable enough.Roll on Snyder cut. I didn't really allow myself to be caught up in they hype since I didn't really think the Snyder superman movies were good enough for me to get excited about this one. After watching it, my verdict? Still not a great film but still enjoyable.In this version the plot made a bit more sense perhaps but also seemed to add certain plot points that seemed a tad convoluted. It also pretty much stripped away most of the light hearted moments that I thought made the otherwise dreary cinematic version more enjoyable. So yes it was better in some respects but so was the cinematic version.", "Not a single good character or performance": "Although Ezra Miller did his best, the flash isn't good in this movie, neither is anyone else. Zack Snyder wants to make a realistic world, yet none of the characters talk like real people. That is because this movie was written by children. These are poorly written characters, most of which are played by talented actors, yet they give bad/lazy performances that bog the movie down more.", "For me? Better than Marvel's Endgame.... With more to come.": "Without going into too much detail, I think this adaptation of the DC universes' take on bringing heroes and heroines together is just too epic..Snyder does brilliantly what he does best. A dark, sometimes monochrome, and slo-mo 4 hour saga of the DC universe. He weaves together an emotional story, from different perspectives of the 'DC'verse' ,with the right music too that has superbly built on Superman V Batman and subsequently what happens after..Some things, I believe are worth waiting for, and this is one of them. After seeing the \"cinema released\" Justice League and now seeing this, they're are worlds apart in terms of cinematography and music score etc.If you're into superhero films and the kin, this is perfect. A director's cut; masterpiece. Just as he intended, wanted. It brings so much DC universe into it and it really is a shame, that this hasn't been brought onto the big screen. Tenet was good, and duped as the saviour of Cinema, but if this was allowed to be viewed (UK viewer, so cinema's are shut right now), this truly would be the saviour of the big screen.Plus, the end credit music is brilliant, given the ironic humour intended.A must watch. Brilliant", "Jesus f#cking Christ!": "Amazing, exciting wow... unbelievable! I really loved it and yes, if you are ready to watch this (No matter if is four hours) trust me, this movie worth it!\nGal Gadot did an amazing acting as Wonder Woman and Ben Affleck as well!\nWhat about Superman? He was really good but Steppenwolf was awesome!", "Not Perfect, but a Great Redemption": "The film is still marred by some of the same story elements and dialogues that Snyder's previous DC films have had. But overall this is infinitely better than the 2017 version. I loved the R rated action and the 300 type score. It is really the first great DCEU film to date. Four hours is a lot to stomach for any film, but this one kept me entertained throughout. I was a skeptic when I heard about the Snyder cut, but I can now say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how good this film was. It gave a title like the Justice League the film it deserves. A great redemption story for Snyder, and DC.", "One of the best DC movie!": "Great visuals and storyline, far better than the Joss Whedon's cut.", "Two different movies with the same core": "Some people might think (like me in the first 90 minutes) that Snyder just took a made movie, saw mistakes, gaps to fill and then he got the idea for this version.But, after finished the movie is clear to me wehave two different movies with the same core.Is a long movie but I think it was necessary to tell the entire story before get ib to the action.Perhaps, I wanted more action, more fight because the faith of the earth is at stake but like I said, it is a looong movie.I like all the details to get into the final minutes. Can't wait to see whats next for the JL.", "This is the Movie that should have been released in 2017.": "As a fan, I must say that this is the movie that I have been waiting for many years, and it does not disappoint, it would have been a pioneer in highly complex themes in the world of superheroes, as Joker was. Unfortunately bad executive decisions deprived Zack Snyder\u00b4s work of being that pioneer.I thank all the team that made this project and also all the fans.\nRestore the Snyderverse !!!", "Spectacular": "It's well worth the wait. Action is enhanced from the previous one. Characters are much more flushed out and lovable. The run time is appropriate as every scene is of importance. Villains are complex and badass, not generic and pathetic like the previous movie. The scenes exceeded my expectations if though my expectations were high. It feels like a new movie.", "Excelent": "I love ZSJL, are best than JL2017. Flash & Cyborg are revindicated", "Seconds please.": "After 4 hours I want more!! The movie is every bit as entertaining as promised, perhaps more. 4 hours and some shoe horned cameos later I wanted more!", "Heartwarming, earnest, beautiful and bombastic.": "I was surprised at just how emotional and unabashedly true to itself it was. The film has a wide range of moods, but it never feels cynical or half hearted.I can't wait to watch it again. All the characters are fantastic, but Ray Fisher as Cyborg brings the heart.", "This film just blew my mind": "It's been a long time coming, I've lived films since I can remember (I'm 47 now) and I've been excited about films in the long distant passed and often films met my expectations (and a LOT of films didn't) it's now been a long long time since I saw a film and just thought \"wow that was amazing\" but this film did that and I was totally blown away by it, i can't remember the last film I saw in which I thought \"I have to see this at the cinema to appreciate it\" but this film is one of those films, the story telling, the cinematography the whole way this was put together was inspiring and equals if not surpasses any of the marvel films which I also like this film really is in a \"league\" of its own (pardon the pun) if anyone has seen the first film version and doesn't feel the need to watch it again this time round you really do need to watch it.", "It's not perfect but the good moments overshadow the weak ones": "Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021)I will start by saying this: if you are debating whether you should \"Spend 4 hours\" watching this film then this review might not be for you. However, if like me you don't mind it being 6 hours long because you are genuinely excited for this movie then enjoy.I was extremely hyped for this Justice League and it delivered to the point that I am ready to re-watch it. This was the most enjoyable superhero experience since Infinity War. Zack managed to pick up the rubble and build it into a spectacular action packed blockbuster. In a way, it felt like watching an entirely new film because there was so much new footage, lore and characters. It filled the plot gaps as to why the whole invasion took place, how was Superman resurrected and most importantly it fleshed out the characters.The film is naturally saturated with Zack's trademark darkness, slow motion and overall brooding theme which I absolutely love. Bear in mind that this man had to literally resurrect this film, much like Superman, and use the available footage to plug the holes. He didn't have a huge budget, actors' full availability nor the luxury of starting from scratch. Hence, he gets a huge pass for the sketchy moments and occasional dialogue cringe. Once again, this is NOT a brand new film so it must be treated accordingly.Unlike the MCU films (not Marvel) which I am a huge fan of, this one had moments of organic emotion involving Lois and Cyborg who is the heart of this film. Being able to genuinely feel for the characters meant a lot. Music certainly played a monumental role in stirring up the emotions and every time the Wonder Woman theme sounded, I could feel the blood coursing through my viens. When \"Problems Up Here\" came up, that sealed the deal as I was in pure ecstacy.I have a huge soft spot for DC and I was extremely satisfied with the story, music and visuals. I wish it could have lasted 8 hours as it felt like watching a TV Show with an appropriate chapter-based storytelling. Might not be a perfect 10/10 but the strong elements make me give a pass on the weak ones. I wholeheartedly hope for Part 2 because the teasers were exhilarating!Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV reviews", "Too Much Better Than Justice League 2017.": "It has good story line.it length 4hours but watch it; it never let you boring. StepphenWolf vs Justice League scene was amazing. It Best Superhero flim ever made.", "Watch it if your a fan of heavy CGI slow mo action sequences": "Let's start by confirming the fact that the Movie is way better than the old one or way be i enjoyed this movie better because the old one sucked big time. This movie particularly has character establishment which I thoroughly liked, it has sensible small emotions and heavy CGI fights, which is something you can expect when you're watching a movie directed by Snyder. The movie still has plot holes and could have been a little shorter but it was Snyder all along. Watch it if you enjoy Snyder style movie making with dark color scheme and various slow motion shots at unwanted times. Overall I liked it, its a pandemic movie, there are not many action movies out there and this one definitely feeds your hunger for one. Also I personally feel this movie should have been re-released in theaters and WB would have made profits. The only downside is cinematography. It's dark and feels like movie has been shot in the Night most of the Time. Lighting was badly used by cinematographer. The two characters cyborg and Batman often had funny way of walking the movie, they both were my least favorite characters in this movie. I don't know if they were asked to perform their scenes in certain way or they had to perform that way because of their uncomfortable costumes.", "Am I really a DC fan now because of this movie": "The answer is yes ! If you haven't seen the Zack Snyder justice league ..... do! I have never been a fan of the DC universe (Minus Christopher Nolan's batman and aqua man ). I usually finish there films with nothing invested in the characters themselves . After watching Z. S. Justice league I just became invested in all the characters I saw on screen . Warner if your reading : please invest in a sequel !! Marvel became absolute garbage after avengers end game destroyed every narrative they had built... so true marvel fans aren't invested in them anymore.... Warner just surpassed my expectations and could easily become a staple for anyone who loves super hero's including me !!!", "DC has redeemed my faith in them": "After watching this I was amazed. First by how good this was! Second by why Warner did not release this version first. Whedons version was mediocre at best. If I were between 5-12 years old I would have like it. Sadly I am 57yrs old. Zack Snyders Justice League should be the future Warner and DC build upon. Nuff said lol.", "So Good.": "This movie has,8/10 plot\n9/10 tone\n10/10 acting\n10/10 direction\n10/10 background score (it gave me chills)\n8/10 cinematography (a little bit of more than necessary slow mo)\n10/10 production design (so cinematic)\n7/10 pace (felt like a binge watching a series)\n9/10 dialogue (were excellent except Aquaman's infamous MyMan)\n(The conversation between Joker and Batman)\n10/10 Action (there's so much more action, duh, it's a superhero movie)For me the selling point of a superhero movie is mainly good action sequences and in that case snyder never disappoints, plus the background score was just perfect for the scenes. We have to give them one more plus point for finishing the movie in the pandemic.", "The greatest DCEU film of all time.": "An absolute masterpiece. I really hope we get two more films or at least one. #SnyderVerse.", "Essential Viewing for D.C. Fans": "The four hour run time just flew by. Great emotional and character-driven moments for all our favourite heroes, and some unexpected (and out of this world) new action sequences! I really hope Warner and DC don't mess this up now by doing another reboot of any or all of these characters.

All characters, back story's and necessary pretext were provided to to make it a pleasurable experience.", "Have I seen a different movie?": "I don't know If everyone is Falling a scam or have Stockholm-Syndrome, but this was really not good. The Characters are either annoying or bland and the Dialogs are cringe worthy. I Loved the story Part about the \"anti life equation\", i made me laugh really hard, when they burned a tribal Tattoo on the ground I l\u00f6st it. Please get Higher standards people. A movie does Not get better, just because it is marketed as an emprovement on Something Bad.", "Great Context for Character Introductions.": "Certainly more cohesive than the original. To be honest, the original version was pretty unmemorable and without context was completely lost on me.The runtime was obviously a little self-indulgent and well as the use of the 4:3 aspect ratio. It's not like this film is some high art or some classic 1950's film.Overall, I found this more engaging and gave context to the introduction of characters despite the minor points made above.", "Still a five": "I wrote a review, but it disappeared. Censored i guess. My main problem is with Batman. Affleck is too old. He is fifty. Period.Its a strange choice after Deradevil.

Great film altogether.": "It's so good that words cannot describe it. Makes us feel way more connected to the characters. The pacing is excellent.

Taking every ounce of footage he had Zack Snyder milked it for all it was worth, not daring to touch any material created by Joss Wheadon (understandably) to create this unnecessarily long production.Ezra Miller is simply awful. In real life and in his role as The Flash. Terrible acting and dialogue along with nothing but cringe moments from the clearly mentally disturbed individual.Gal Gadot is equally dreadful in terms of acting but at least I can separate her from her character, unlike with Ezra Miller.Everyone else is fantastic, especially Ray fisher and J. K Simmons. It's nice to see a version of Ben Affleck who doesn't look tired, bored and sick of the whole production.", "EPIC MOVIE SUPER HEROES NO ONE": "Great.i ilke it.thnks snyder cut.

So much better than the first one!": "What a great ride!The movie is not perfect, but was so much more epic than the first release back 2017 in the theathers.The music, villains,Cyborg and his dad and a badass Wonder Woman where great.Every hero had their place, and it worked from my part off view.DC must continue this storyline, its adult,dark and brutal sometimes. DC was always somewhat more serious than marvel with their storytelling.Saying this a fan from both comicworlds.I think this stands at place 2 for superheroes movies for me.First infinty war and then the Snyder one,in my oppinion.Loved it!

That awful \"quota\" trend and cancel culture that started to control major film studios, ruined creativity and in attempt to please everyone, released simply awful or uninspiring movies such a last wonder woman or birds of prey.This is the DC universe that we've been waiting for! This is a good introduction and combination of all our beloved heroes from the universe. This is, without a doubt the best DC comics movie to date. An excellent competition to Marvel Avengers. And as it seems Marvel is falling into the same trap as everyone else, DC will rise as long as they continue this exact line.\nEverything works like a big comic came to life.

Better than the original but that's not saying much. It's honest unnecessarily long because there were a LOT of \"nothing\" scenes. \"Oh look at the grass... the mountains... look at that butterfly!\" ._.\nSeriously, cut out all those pointless scenes you can bring it down to 3 hours. There's so many references to so many things that I'm confused as to what the point is. Martian Manhunter, Joker, Deathstroke... So is this Snyder Cut canonized as the real DCEU Justice League and we're gonna get proper sequels and follow ups? If not, the heck was the point of all that? Fanservice?

It's too easy to tell, who has the heart and works for the art and who is just doing works and for the money. It is a spectacular movie and has created a solid universe for the extension of DC superheroes. It's just like what the movie told: the age of heroes has returned. WB must have their heads run by the truck to reject this movie but to take in Joss's. They are simply idiots. Nevertheless the film is too stuffed. But it's understandable as it is Zack Synder's last chance.", "A true masterpiece": "Bravo, Mr. Snyder. My eyes were full of excitement as I watched your version of Justice League. You're a true visionary. The elaborate storytelling was impactful and the visuals you produced is something to marvel. The way the characters were developed made sense and the way you tied in the DC Universe was on point. Each character had their time to shine.The depiction of the Knightmare universe left me feeling the intensity of the moment. And Jared Leto's Joker finally had his time to shine. I recommend this movie to everyone of the age to watch it. I hope your vision will continue through the DC Universe.", "PLEASE MORE!!!": "IT IS WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST MOVIE. IT IS JUST GREAT!!!

I hope the next Justice League remains like this or better.", "One of the best superhero's movies in a while!!!": "Having been extremely excited about the justice league when it was first announced, I was very disappointed when first saw that movie. The character arcs and the overly comical tone along with the greatest fake mustache ever used in a movie made it an impossible thing to be liked. When the synder cut was announced, I thought it would just be some additional scenes but man was I wrong. This 4 hour epic really showed some of the best character development by DC and each character had a arc which made this movie so much more enjoyable and not to mention the dark and gritty tone really took this movie to a new level. This is the Justice League that fans deserve and the movie is definitely worth it!!! The length can be a issue for some and yes some part may feel a bit stretched but ultimately it is definitely a movie that should be watched by everyone who saw the older version and I am sure that everyone will be very pleased with the overall result. A next installment is definitely needed and as long as Warner bros don't mess with Synders vision, I can certainly say that this could be turned into an amazing series that will satisfy both fans and new audience alike.", "This movie was awesome.": "This reminded me of Watchmen when it came out.

This is NOT the same movie as the 2017 Whedon version. Nearly every character is elevated in some way, whether it is story or personality. Some of the best upgrades in terms of characters are Batman, The Flash, and obviously Cyborg. Steppenwolf also deserves to be mentioned, as he actually feels like a threat to be taken seriously. At the same time, Steppenwolf's motivations are explored. The story is much more fleshed out and there are so many great lines of dialogue, thanks to Terrio. Oh, and Darkseid is in this.

For me this filled in all the ridiculous gaps Josh left in his. It's not a perfect film, but it's nice and dark. Love how they changed almost characters personality. Also Batman isn't as useless in this. Cyborg, Flash and mean Aquaman are great! WW is well WW.Only lesson learned is WB and DC should have paced themselves like Marvel. Either way this and the extended cut of B vs S helps seal it all up since we will most likely never seen anymore of these guys together! Cyborg is much needed but well ya we know Ray's personality doesn't mesh with WB at this time!", "Sometimes more is much more": "I have no complaints about this movie.I said a few weeks ago that if Zack Snyder's Justice League works we're going to start watching four-hour superhero movies.Today I have to say that it worked. I saw the entire film at once, she did not bore me at any time, and I loved every second.It is superior to the original version.I fell in love with Wonder Woman again after hating her in Wonder Woman 1984.\nThis movie gives us the best Batman I have ever seen.The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are more rounded.This film is a feast for fans of Superheroes, and for writers because we can see a developed from beginning to end, in great detail, without the filters that the studio usually puts. We are seeing the vision of the filmmaker in its fullest splendor.I hope that WB has learned its lesson and they give creative control to the filmmakers and not to the marketing people.But I want to make something clear; Justice League 2017 wasn't Joss Whedon's fault; not even WB's fault. It was our fault! Remember how much people criticized BvS dark tone? Well there you have it! We were saying \"why can't you make DC movies just like Avengers?\" And WB did just that! They brought Avenger's director to redo Justice League to please all DC cry babies fans. And I remember that many people that today are talking crap about Whedon's Justice League, praised the movie when it came out. So don't make this about Joss Whedon. This is a lesson for all of us, movie fans.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a perfect movie, a real work of art, but in 2017 we weren't ready to appreciate it.My only regret is that I didn't get to see it in the movie theater.

It felt off and when you really listen you cannot deny when Superman is looking at the sun there really needs to be his theme song play. BIG MISS there.CGI was lacking both on PC and my Big Screen, not to mention all the Slow Motion, ya I get Zach Snyder but it was so not needed.Finally the epilogue, this was clearly trying to set-up something in the future and took away imo from the rest of the show. It had enough teasing in the film to Lanterns and Martian Man hunter.

That's why even after seeing so many issues with the original Josstice League, I couldnt get myself to hate that one. But this DCEU has always been Snyder's Vision & its really important that we get to witness his Version & once again the power of the Fandom is proven. So here is my take-I still dont think its a Masterpiece, but its a far better version in every way possible & a film worth keeping in my collection. Almost all the characters are elevated from the original. The Action sequences are better & the final battle has been taken from Meh to Truly Epic. Flash & Cyborg in the original were respectively a bumbling idiot & brooding bore but they have been completely redeemed. Cyborg having the most emotional character arc & Flash having the most Badass scene in the whole film. I am now actually excited for their solo films. The bgm now actually makes your heart pump. The story actually has purpose & the actions of the characters make sense now. All the stupid Whedon jokes are gone. Steppenwolf is now a villain with a genuine purpose & the way the Darkseid & Injustice Storyline has been set up, Fans will not let WB Executives sleep until they announce the sequel.\nBut there are some cons, the Imax aspect ratio is weird for home viewing & there were so many slow-mo shots which made some earlier scenes feel slow. And I have also my doubts if this was a theater release & he had to keep it under 3 hours, he might not have been able to keep this level of quality.", "Do not expect this to be something completely different": "A review without major spoilers.\nBasically, this is the exact movie we wanted in 2017.

Like really post apocalyptic looking movie, when it's supposed to be set in the current USA.\nThird, plz this CGI team is so so so bad.. we looks like a doll, superman like a videogame, and stepenwolf like a drag quueen. Almost as bad as the ww84 CGI team, and for me that's the worst high budget CGI I've seen\nAnd what's the point with those purple reflexes in all of stepenwolf body? And what about that final dram?

What a revive of a franchise, can't wait to see what else is in store for this universe. Let Zack direct any DC movie from now on PLEASEEEE!!", "A work of passion and vision": "I'm going to keep this review short and simple.\nMain cons I noticed:\nPoor CGI at many points but ignorable\nBatman, his fight scene in the tunnel is kind of weak, he only inflicts damage using his Knightcrawler and gets wiped in a one on one with a parademon, In the final battle he spent the whole fight fighting outside with parademons, I get it, he had to distract the parademons but he was just using a gun to shoot them in the head, I was expecting a warehouse kind of fight scene but nevermind. Just from overall point of view, he felt weak compared to BvS Batman but he was definitely perfect as the Leader and brains of Justice league.\nThe Flash, I know he's supposed to be the fun element but the jokes could have been reduced, But boy did he grew as a crucial member of the Justice league. Healing himself and undoing the unity formation sequence was brilliant.\nJoker's laugh, I still can't take it seriously but the rest of Leto's joker has been redeemed.\nNotice the above cons all also come with positive points except CGI. Snyder actually listened to the criticism.\nNow for the pros:\nEverything else. From story to characters like SteppenWolf and Cyborg, what a thrill ride. I am definitely all in for the last two parts of Snyder's vision. WB would be a fool to not strike when the iron is red hot. The critical reaction is good, audience reception is great and all the signs just point to continue this universe.\nOverall an 8/10 movie, it has it's flaws but none the less, Still amazing.\nFor Autumn :)", "ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE is the history of Cinema.": "A masterpiece, carved by artists and craftsmen who love and take their craft seriously. A film that honors the comics, extolling its creators and treating the material with the respect they deserve and embracing the mythology that DC comics fans love.Epic, solemn, emotional and dramatic. They will laugh, cry, hate and love. And like in a dream, you wish it never ends. It is the movie that those of us who have fought tirelessly for 4 years for this deserve (yes, even before the 2017 premiere). It's been a rough ride so it's hard to judge this movie on the good and the not so good (which it does, but that's another debate). It is perfect in its imperfection, as is life.The campaign for the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, although we were many supporting, was a constant David against Golliat, of physical and psychological wear and tear against a powerful studio (Golliat) that did everything possible to silence us, the fans, Zack and Ray Fisher seeking justice ... And I think that taking into account those circumstances, being able to have the movie and that Zack has been able to do something close to what he wanted to do is an unprecedented miracle.It is a film that Zack Snyder has been able to do only in an act of rebellion against a corporation that wanted to eliminate him forever from DC Films to adopt the movie tone that was in fashion. And the award obtained for this fight has been cataclysmic for all of us who make up \"The Snydercut Family.\"If Zack REALLY had the studio's support, he could make even more incredible movies. You just have to believe and let the artists work.\nWe need more Zacks Snyders and less Warner Brothers. More creative and fewer committees. More risk and less crowd pleasing products.

I like zack synder forever.", "A pretty fast 4 hours": "I was worried about the movie being 4 hours, but the time went by fast and I started watching at 10pm.", "A meditative heavy metal opera that brings the comic book film to the next level. An In-depth Review of ZSJL.": "In 2018, I remember twiddling my thumbs over whether to buy Justice League on Blu-ray. Looking at the back cover and realizing it had no deleted scenes, I sighed and reinserted it on the shelf with the hope that the original cut of the film would be released one day. It seemed like a pipe dream considering the way the studio lost faith and buried the original film. The Richard Donner cut of Superman II took 26 years to come to Blu-Ray. And now, that mythical unicorn is here. Zack Snyder's Justice League is an epic meditative heavy metal opera that brings the comic book film to the next level. The plot is beat-for-beat the same as the theatrical cut and yet it is a completely different experience altogether from how those beats are punctuated. Zack Snyder's taste, for a lack of a better term, is metal. I mean head-banging, distorted guitar solos, and dramatic album cover art featuring flaming swords. Think of the metallic S symbol from Man of Steel. Think of the Wonder Woman theme. And then think of his cinematography as a visual accompaniment to heavy metal music. It's a high-octane, turn-up-the-volume, and savoring-the-moment all-on assault on the senses. The MCU has taken the time to teach the audience how to watch a comic book serial story through their four cinematic phases. Now the whole world waits for MCU content like fans eagerly awaiting the next monthly issue. They're aware the world is interconnected in a larger story and sit through the end credits for the tease. Zack Snyder is artistically ahead of that learning curve. He is straight-up doing his own authorial interpretation of the DC property. To use comic book terminology, he's doing his own run and his universe plays out closer to an Elseworlds one-off story than the official run. Snyder's deconstructionist approach with Superman and Batman is tonally a step closer to the sensibilities of Superman: Red Son or Justice League: Gods and Monsters. The heroes begin from an unfamiliar place and eventually become the characters we know and love. That was the plan anyway. Zack Snyder sees the DC heroes as gods first, in the Greek mythological sense, and comic book characters second. The heroes are all examined in an unhurried meditative manner where the audience is allowed to rest their heads lop-sided on their hands and just marvel at who these characters are to their core. Thus, the onion peeling begins and we view them romantically, existentially, and even metaphysically akin to Terrence Malick's Tree of Life. Through the film's many slow-motion sequences, whether it is Wonder Woman waiting to dodge a bullet or The Flash handling Iris West like a delicate piece of hotpot tofu in a super speed rescue attempt, we witness how much power they possess over these situations. The slow-motion is visually arresting, yes, but it is presented in a contemplative chin-stroking fashion. At first, we wow at the action scenes and Fabian Wagner's lush cinematography, then we're given the time to reflect on what's happening, and then we begin to think how our lives would monumentally change if meta-humans really existed in our society. As Dr. Silas Stone tells Victor Stone, Cyborg, who has the most prominent story arc, \"The challenge is not what you can do. It will be not doing it.\" What's saving lives is not the superpowers themselves, it is the fact that these heroes choose to save people. The additional runtime devotes itself to establishing each of the heroes' journey towards finding their humanity and meaning, thus having a reason to being heroic. Batman is guilt-ridden and desperate to unite the team. Wonder Woman wrestles with whether humanity deserves her help. Aquaman hates who he is and rejects his place in the world. The Flash is eager to prove himself. Cyborg, who has become a superhero through a freak accident, has all of everyone else's problems combined. The League's characterizations are treated with the utmost earnestness. We feel for all the characters deeply and they are all emotionally grounded in these moments of visual poetry that deliver a full-spectrum of feels. For example in one scene, Aquaman chugs a bottle of whiskey, takes off his shirt before diving into the ocean over The Kingdom by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The song alludes to his destiny calling out to him as the true King of Atlantis. However, as the chorus kicks in, combined with how begrudgingly Arthur Curry is prepping himself before his dive, the word \"king\" is endlessly repeated in the song. It feels like the word \"king\" is droning in Arthur's head, something Atlanteans have been telling him his whole life. You realize Aquaman craves solace away from the surface and Atlantis and I feel it. Yes, it is in slow motion but there's so much packed in each frame. I was initially worried about the film being indulgent but the four hours are well earned. There's never a dull moment. This is the best storytelling in any given Zack Snyder film by far. This is not a word I would easily throw around, this is Zack Snyder's masterpiece. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is the standout character. The restored Victor Stone story is textured and touching as the heart of the story. Gal Gadot, at the time of filming Justice League, was still finding her footing as Wonder Woman. That is solid by the time we get to WW84. As much as I enjoyed WW84 executed in the Richard Donner tone, it seemed like the world unanimously agreed it was outdated. I have to say, I do prefer Wonder Woman kicking butt with a sword and shield. Connie Nelson kicks butt too as Queen Hippolyta; something she didn't get to do in the Wonder Woman movies. Ezra Miller and Jeremy Irons provide comic relief. They are brief moments of levity, but the jokes land. This is not a comedy trying to button every moment with a laugh. All the best jokes from the 2019 release are Zack Snyder's. It's nice to see Henry Cavil have upper lips again. Off of the foundation from Man of Steel and BvS, Superman and Batman are now the characters we all know and love. Dying and being resurrected is a crucible that Superman has to go through to transcend his humanity to be something more. Ben Affleck's Batman goes through a similar crucible from being cynical to hopeful. They both feel earned and their growth feels permanent. Ben Affleck's The Batman will never see the light of the day now but I still hope for a Man of Steel sequel. The villains are given better characterization and bring true stakes. Steppenwolf is much more threatening and creepy in his original design. His sentient scaly armor and demon-like appearance make him a customer you don't want to mess with. I like Steppenwolf's taunts and even felt bad for him at one point. Tom Holkenborg's score, which he completely rewrote from scratch for this release, is ambitious and glorious. He takes the foundation laid down by Hans Zimmer in the previous DC films and shoots for the stars, unleashing everything at his disposal. Make no mistake, this is opera. This is longer than a movie, shorter than a TV mini-series, and presented in an unconventional 4:3 aspect ratio that captures the intimacy and the grandiose moments. It just screams for an IMAX release. I have seen this film three times now and I still don't feel like I have properly digested it. People who haven't enjoyed Zack Snyder's DC films in the past are unlikely to change their minds. It takes a certain amount of investment from the previous two films to go along with where this takes you. But I believe it will for some. It seems fans have gotten more open-minded after the conclusion of Marvel's Infinity Saga and COVID-19. Frankly, I think people ruin it for themselves by comparing. People are now saying how things ideally should have been and how could the studio execs have such bad foresight. I agree. Though in all fairness, I do not see how Zack Snyder's Justice League could have happened any other way. There is no parallel universe where Warner Bros would have released a 4-hour version in theaters. Watchmen and Batman v Superman both have had director's cuts released on Blu-ray that have received higher critical praise. Best case scenario, Justice League would have been cut down to 3 hours and then later released as a 4-hour Blu-ray and that wouldn't have had the same impact as it would now. The movie ends on a cliffhanger, flashing forward to where the story goes next in a Mad Max-like apocalyptic future. This would have been the intended fourth movie in the original five-film plan. Zack Snyder has said that Warner Bros has no intention of continuing on with his story. I remain optimistic nonetheless. I'd hate to say goodbye. We've already seen the mythical unicorn. It is easier to believe now that the Snyderverse will be restored.", "Greatest Superhero Movie ever.": "What can I say.

The Joker scene has no sense in my opinion because of poor dialogues. Some of the new comic characters introduced could have been better cared in their appearance. Some scenes are futiles or not well recited such as the repeated hug of the revived without any talk of a word and a deeper look to describe the intensity of the moment. The past tale could have been better portrayed improving the scenography. Big stories need longer duration, the reason this movie has got more appreciation of its predecessor. Many movies have been penalized because too short to represent many events in short time, reduced by deadline and cutting as well. I remember the Aliens long release, where it is clear why the aliens attack from above: the first attack went bad.

It's dramatic (in a good way), dark, and extremely thorough with its characters and their development. It's very well acted, the cinematography and score is extremely well done, especially with those ratio and slow-motion scenes. The CGI is 'extravagant' at times (for the lack of better words, doesn't necessarily bad) but it's just a trademark of Zack Snyder's style.The story is extremely slow-paced, but there's enough things to make the story going. It gets better as it's going. Zak Snyder is a genius story teller, and comic is definitely his specialty. This 4hour long film is definitely a lot to take in and appeal only to a very specific demographic especially with the first hour, BUT it is still very enjoyable. It's definitely way better than the theatrical cut. I'm not gonna tell you what to do with your life, but you (might) not want to watch this film in one sitting.Fan Rating 10/10\nI can really appreciate the message from Zack in the beginning of the film. I can tell that this film means a great deal to him, as it did to the fans. Years ago, Zack Snyder's Justice League is literally a myth.

The story makes sense and there is a much better focus on the individual characters, especially Victor Stone, which the movie now centers around. The use of music, sound and score is fantastic and makes such a huge difference. Zack Synder has certainly managed to restore the film and l hopes for a possible future DC universe. The problem with the film from the very beginning is that the franchise was rushed. Instead of taking the time to build the franchise with solo projects and development, there seemed to be a desperate rush to build a team based setup (playing Marvel catchup). The investment in the characters just simply doesn't exist. The acting of the characters doesn't help either. Finally the actual story is weak. It's not super believable and you can find yourself losing focus throughout. Unfortunately no reshoots or do-overs would have fixed that.", "4-hrs of suck": "Disclaimer--I gave it one star only because I had to, it really didn't deserve it.The first iteration of this movie may not have been an award winning endeavor, but it was more entertaining and fun to watch.

In a way this movie makes Batman v Superman a bit worse than it was, since this movie's (and Snyder DCEU's) biggest issue is that there was no need (and no point) to kill Superman so quickly, everyone knew he wouldn't stay dead for long.The movie is almost four hours and you could've easily cut the parts with Lois and Martha and resurrecting Superman and you'd get a solid-ish movie with a ton of substance to even begin with. Snyder could've skipped the origin stories of Flash and Cyborg completely and just trust the characters. The knightmare scenes were just kinda dumped on the movie (like in BvS).There's just too much. Even Batman v Superman had way too much going on (cut Doomsday and cut Wonder Woman and maybe focus on the conflict that was in the name of the movie) but that's a review of its own.The music was good. The visuals were surprisingly good and Steppenwolf looked great. Darkseid and Green Lantern cameos were awesome. Fight scenes were good. Batfleck and especially Flash were great. Snyder clearly understands some of these characters really well and DCEU always had a more comic book feel than Marvel.Zack Snyder should've done a Batman movie and a Justice League movie before he tried to do a Trinity/Justice League 0 and a Let's Set Up the Justice League Trilogy movie.Calvin Swanwick was awkwardly forced into this movie and I'm very sure that he was supposed to be just Swanwick in the original plan but Snyder just went all in with the ideas he had. And this comes from a Snyder fan, I love Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead. He should've been a producer and a cinematographer and let someone else work on his vision.", "A good balanced superhero movie but quite long.": "A good movie, if not the best, but still one of the bests.

This man gave a young DC fans hope back, hope to see the Snyderverse pan out in the vision that Zack has intended.Zack Snyder's Justice league is the final piece of the puzzle that brought a fitting end to the formation of the justice league arc. The world which has been built is contributed due to the amazing CGI that outshines that of its predecessor, music that is entrancing and character development that remind us of the characters we loved reading in our comic books.This is a must watch!!!!", "The best ever made": "Thanks DC U for this amazing experience\nPlease give us part 2", "One of the best superhero films of all time": "Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece. I can't believe this is real, but it is.", "how many hours?": "It is easy to find faults with something after it has been built. Making a movie is alot of work, and making a block buster, more than many.\nThe general tone of Zack Snyder Justice league is darker & more emotional than the previous one. In many aspects it is saturated. Especially the music & use of slow motion technique.\nThe music is divers & extraordinary, yet over-used. As if they have tried to compensate for some unknown shortcoming with its presence. The music is also loud. But it is a nuisance in most superhero movies, in my opinion.\nThe slow motion technique is used so many times in ZSJL that I can say overshadows the loud music issue. At least seven minutes out of the 3 hours & 55 minutes is dedicated to slow motion.\nAll the characters are at the same time richer & darker, especially the Flash & Cyborg, except for Superman which is darker & more untouchable. For instance, in Jl 2017 when Superman meets Steppenwolf he says: \"Well, I believe in truth. But I'm also a big fan of justice.\" This amazing quote is now replace with a simpler more arrogant one.\nThe background stories relating Cyborg & the Aqua man to their parents is one of the strong points in ZSJL. All in all, the parent-kid bonds in this movie are given alot more time.\nTo sum it all up, I must say if you need 4 hours plus a previous movie to tell one story, you need to have built at least five movies previously. It bothers me that DC & Disney are rushing all the wonderful characters & their stories; as if their aim is to please only theose who are already fans, and not to find new ones.", "Finally real Justice League": "Yesterday bought it and watched it alone , wow what a film , one word it was freaking amazing and 4 hours is zo fast gone, i did really enjoyed the film, story , fight action effect every thing is perfect , gonna watch again tonight", "not perfect, but at least a very impressive try to focus back on scene after films can speak": "Since movies can speak, movies chatter too much. Zack Snyder's movie are far from perfect, but at least he tried, tried not to chatter, but to focus on scenes. Four hours might be a bit too much , but that's because that's a Hbomax version, actually Zack can cut a 150 minutes version for theater, but Warner don't appreciate this version. Besides, cause there might be no Justice League II and III (or 2.5, 2plus), Zack show us some part of JLII and JLIII in here, so it takes longer.Much better than Whedon version, of course. Wheperman fights with only fists, but Snuderman really knows how to fight, actually he's a bit Wing Chun.", "MIND BLOWING!!!!": "God Zack Snyder Killed it!!I must say before this when i heard he was gonna make his own version i was very very against it as the first justice league was bad... i gave it decent ratings only cause im a DC comic book fan so The part of me that liked the film is only because of the characters m the nostalgia.But for Zack Snyders version like wow i kinda felt like we all got what we been waiting for... a successful Justice League Movie !!Warner Bros should stop worrying and always trying to take control of how the production/Directing should go Cause often Studios makes bad movies when they try to take full control.Its 2021 for god sakes. This PG or Rated 14A or Rated R ratin garbage should fix itself to todays standards since now and days 10 yrs old can access 14A movies just on a cellphone or Rated R.If we fix our Movie rating standards than Many of the movies like Justice League or any other Adaptation movies from comcis/Video Games wouldnt have suffered a major fail the first time.SnyderVerse plz Continue!! This darker gritty tone is more realistic of the Storyline and what we need, not that kiddy PG stuff lol.Thank you Snyder and i Hope The Rock Makes Black Adam Continue the Snyderverse!", "The future has taken root in the present": "I have been a fan of Zack since DotD in 2004. I love his 3 previous DC films dearly and fought for years to get this movie released. It finally arrived and Snyder delivered yet again! TSC is another instant classic and a fully different film from the 2017 studio abortion. Up there with TDK, Into the Spider-Verse or the animated DKR movie. A film as wild as it is bold and a true sequel to BvS on top of that. Even the critics who left Zack\u00b4s side after Watchmen seem to like this film. Who saw that coming?The film isn\u00b4t as tightly plotted as (UE) BvS or (DC) Watchmen, the film could lose about 10 minutes through smart editing, a few of the musical choices are a tiny bit out there and knowing what Zack wanted to shoot but couldn\u00b4t stings slightly. These are all the negatives I have. There rest fires on all cylinders and who knew that Cyborg was prime \"league material\" all along? His performance shines bright in a movie filled with great acting. The full-frame aspect ratio is perfectly chosen, 98% of the CG effects are godlike, the score is unforgettable and I can say for the first time that the JLA finally got a truly great origin story. Something the team never had in any medium up to now. This is the real deal. The team further comes together as one during the course of the film as opposed to the last version of this film. The R-rating is also a soft one, just like with UE BvS, but the freedom it gives this film is well used. Bury the 2017 cut (3/10) and let's hope that WB or at least WM can see the light at the end of the tunnel and give Snyder his old job back. The one he was born for as this film has more cliffhangers than Return of the King has endings. All these actors need to come back, especially Ray Fisher, and we need parts 4 and 5 to close this quintet. HBO Max? The bell cannot be unrung!#RestoreTheSnyderVerse, #ReleaseTheAyerCut, #MakeTheBatfleckMovie, etc.", "Thank you zack snyder": "For me, it's the best superheroes movie ever, perfect pace, perfect setup for the stories, Everything is explained, everything makes sense with each other, literally there's nothing wrong with this movie except for the excessive use of slowmotion and the music that was played first time diana showed up and maybe the acting of the amazons during their fight with steppenwolf, it was a little bit over or something, but I didn't like how superman was overpowered compared to the other justice league members combined", "Restoring Hope for DC": "I've got to admit, after thinking DC had it's boring fill of movies in it's film universe, this film absolutely blows away the bad films such as Suicide Squad, Green Lantern, and Batman v Superman. While there were some unnecessary scenes like the Aquaman Choir or the slow motion shots, the emotional impact each character's stories provided made you hungry for more of these characters in the future. Scenes like the Flashpoint and Knightmare sequences were absolutely stunning and the anticipation was worth the hype behind the #releasethesnydercut movement. For once, a DC film gave me hope for the expansive DC cinematic universe. I truly hope this can restore the movies that were to transpire from this.", "Just incredible": "I know people will disagree but this one of Zack Snyder's best and easily one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. The 4 hour runtime seems long but I was engrossed that it seemed to just flyby. Loved it, will be rewatching!", "One of the best cbm films Ive ever seen": "The 1st act of this film was amazing! The action and character set ups were well done.\nThe 2nd act was good , Characters like cyborg and the flash were well written.\nThe CGI/VFX were good though there were a few shots where the CGI felt off but other than that It was amazing .The 3rd act was epic ! The action was insane + the visuals and the set up for future films was on point.\nIm still not a fan of Letos Joker But Overall The Film was epic !!!!", "Plastic": "Feels like a robot trying to transmit human emotions.", "Brilliant movie": "What an amazing film , wasn't sure about this and thought it was gonna be the same movie but hell no it was completely amazing , everything about it was fascinating and entertaining.Glad that zack snyder got to complete his vision which I still believe we need to see much more movies done by him. Hope we get a sequel since I was left hanging at the end.Brilliant movie.", "Ok!!!!": "Why on earth would warner bros not release this in the first place?This is a massive improvement from what we got in 2017 and i mean a massive improvement, not just the story and the plot but this version made me actually love this version of cyborg and the flash. In the orginal I didn't like what they did with the flash and cyborg honestly didn't even have to be in the movie but in this version they are amazing and i hope to see them again.I'm not a Snyder stan so this is my honest opinion, I didn't expect much with this movie i went in thinking it's probably gonna be trash but i knew it would of been better than what we got in 2017 because well obviously thats not hard to do, but anyway this version took me by suprise. Its more detailed, each character has more of a backstory meaning the flash and cyborg mainly they went more into their story than the original.The only thing I don't like about the movie and this is a me problem not really a flaw in the movie it's self is the format ratio, it was just annoying I spent alot of the movie looking at the black bars covering most of my screen. Also in some scenes the CGi wasn't that great but not bad to the point its unwatchable like the last one, so other than that the Snyder cut is by far superior to the original and I don't understand why they didn't release this in the first place.", "Thank you zack znyder": "Epic this is the justice audience wanted 4 years ago", "All things considered, by Part 3, I was firmly team Steppenwolf!": "Silly, self-serious, and stupid. Interminably long. Endless slow-motion shots, heavy handed, often with awful music. A film lacking in any compelling characters, all universally unlikable. This could only appeal to forgiving children with endless patience or those with a willingness to view it over multiple sittings.As said, while not knowing the driving force behind Steppenwolf's actions, he was far more compelling than the dregs that are the Justice League. I wished death upon all of these 'heroes' many times over throughout the course of the 'film'.Ben Affleck cosplaying Batman is a cringeworthy low point but they are all universally terrible; upon meeting Barry and Victor my allegiance to Steppenwolf was sealed; the endless slow-motion/exposition heavy/score-filled posing/montages were uniquely awful and only reaffirmed this conviction.The bright spots were well hidden amongst the muck, so much muck. This is not storytelling. This should be viewed as the abomination it is, epitomising the worst of Hollywood's excesses and the vapid shallowness that is modern life. The rarest of occasions where the 1 stars are fully understandable and likely warranted (its redeeming features being far too few).Let this be the final nail in this iteration of said universe and/or join me in imagining a better world where Steppenwolf won the day..", "Thanks mr Snyder": "Amazing film, four hours just flew by.\nThis is what a superhero sci fi movie should look like,\nThat said, worst Batman ever except for Val Kilmer", "Snyder cut ugly": "Boring, graphically ugly, weird stories, ridiculous characters. An infant product that is just right for 5-year-olds. Yet another bad DC product!!!!! Bad and boring.", "Its time to forget last version": "When i saw this , i truly understand why old version is rubbish !!!final battle is mind-blowing!\nits all about shameshame on U WB to ruined this title", "One hell of a ride": "Finally after years for waiting for the true justice league movie, we have it. And it is amazing, all the characters are developed good and get their moments to shine. This feels like a complete different movie than what we have seen before.", "The cut that should have been released in 2017.": "I saw the 2017 theatrical version on opening night and in all honesty I walked thinking that was okay...but then the more I saw it I came to a realization that I fooled myself into thinking it is good because I desperately wanted to like a DCEU film other than MAN OF STEEL and WONDER WOMAN. As a fan and consumer of this material I did a lot of digging about this film and was on the #releasethesnydercut movement the minute I learned about his overall vision for DC.I won't go on about the history of how the theatrical version of JUSTICE LEAGUE was botched by WB executives, Kevin Tsujihara, Joss Whedon, Geoff Johns, and others. It has been addressed multiple times. through the trades. It was everyone's fault, including Zack himself for releasing a BVS film that made no sense and then releasing an Ultimate Cut that should have been the final product. So with that being said...ZSJL delivered. The story is essentially the same, but edited in his style and tone and offers way more than what we got originally. Which begs the question, while it's almost the same film, I really wonder what did WB see that scared them so badly to force mandated reshoots, add crappy humor, and polish it with half-assed VFX. Anyways...CHARACTERS:SUPERMAN: His role is about the same, but no gross VFX on his face. The black suit is cool, but unnecessary. When Superman appears, the film is dialed to 11 and I'm praying Cavill continues this role.BATMAN: Gone is the joking and half-assed performance given by Affleck in the mandated reshoots. I got the Batman I fell in love with in BvS back to some degree. He is so much better here and I'm not over the fact that we'll never likely see an Affleck written and directed Batman film which is teased here in this cut.WONDER WOMAN: Way more brutal to her enemies which is exactly how I like it. She's Amazonian warrior and it makes sense she holds no punches back against her foes.FLASH: He is not the dumb buffoon talking about \"brunch\" and cracking lame jokes here. In this version I got a Barry Allen more in tune with his comic-counterpart. A little more mature, but still lighthearted and he has an awesome scene where he uses the speed force. I don't understand why that was cut.AQUAMAN: He came off more subtle in his closed off personality than the crappy theatrical version, and I really appreciated that. There was also a lot more for him to do in terms of action and we diver deeper into his distain for the surface and for Atlantis. Aquaman also comes across more sympathetic as well which is a plus.CYBORG: I can now understand why Ray Fisher was upset. Cyborg lost ALL THE DEVELOPMENT in the theatrical version which was mandated to be only two hours at length. A lot of growth here with Cyborg and he really was the heart of the film. Can't believe all the material they scrapped for his character. Cyborg is the MVP.MARTIAN MANHUNTER: It's just a cameo, but ugh I would have loved to see more of him, although one nitpick is he chose to avoid all the events that transpired only to show up after the battle is finished. I think it would stand to reason for him to show up and help out.STEPPENWOLF: Steppenwolf in this film didn't blow me away, but he has a better appearance, better VFX, and overall better motives. At the very least I got to understand why he's doing what he's doing which the theatrical cut failed to elaborate.DARKSEID: What a damn shame that this film will not have any sequels...all this build up and set up for more future stories for nothing, but regardless I was very pleased with every Darkseid moment.KNIGHTMARE STUFF: I love the Knightmare stuff. I like the bleakness of it all and I ate it up. The tone is a nice contrast to what MARVEL does. I like that Snyder swings big with his ideas, and while it didn't work for me entirely in BVS, it works here in JL. We also got one scene where Affleck's Batman interacts with Leto's Joker. It would have been extremely sad if we never saw this so I'm pleased that Zack gave us this interaction. On a side note, I never hated Jared Leto's performance in SUICIDE SQUAD. Like Ray Fisher, you can tell his performance was entirely cut in that film, and here in one scene we get a nice moment with him as the Joker and frankly I want more.I understand the statements of saying the length would make the film not work in theaters and that some might feel the length. BUT for me, I sat through four hours with no intermission. Yes, somewhere here, there is an amazing 3 hour film that would have sang, but not once did I feel bored. My eyes were glued from start to finish.Some things that didn't work for me was the usage of slow-mo. It's cool here and there, but it is a bit overused. There are some cringe moments where Aquaman leaves a village he visits in the beginning of the film and the people there yodel and sing for him as he swims away, and it just goes on for a long minute. It was awkward to watch. When Flash saves Iris West, while a cool scene to look at, he came off as creepy as he was caressing Iris in the moment, while he was saving her life from a car accident. Also no trucker would bend down that long to grab his burger on the floor, that was a bit dumb.In closing this was mostly everything I wanted and more. To reiterate, I'm not a Zack Snyder hater, I quite liked most of his films except for some, and as a fan of comics, I will forever be in his debt for giving me Henry Cavill's Superman, MAN OF STEEL, and Ben Affleck's Batman. To this day I will never understand why people hate MAN OF STEEL. It's everything a new Superman film should be and I will defend it to my grave and Affleck is by far the best iteration of Batman I've ever seen on screen.However, with the exception of some, I would never call most of the DCEU films great by any means, but I liked a lot of things about it, namely the cast and some character moments that are unfortunately overshadowed by crappy films as a whole.While the structure of the story is the same, the characters had more weight and the length helped them benefit from it. Again yes, I can understand the length issue, and somewhere there probably is a great 3 hour cut of the movie, but it was not an issue for me. In its best moments, I felt that it achieves a very distinct feel throughout, somewhere between hopeful and haunting, mythical and enchanting.ZSJL is a massive improvement over the theatrical cut. I'm pleased as someone who didn't love the DCEU films as whole, but liked the cast, tone and what it was going for. I never thought we'd see this cut of the movie and I'm thankful we got it cause for the longest time, all I could do after researching everything about it was just imagine the film in my head, but now that it's here all shot, composed and ready I'm very happy and if nothing else comes out of this then so be it, cause a release of ZSJL was all I wanted and I got, but I would be lying to you if I said I'm not hopeful about a continuation. Because I REALLY WANT A CONTINUATION.Based on all the stuff I read about Snyder's plans I was all in and fingers crossed that it can continue as we live in a world where Jamie Foxx and Alfred Molina are returning to the SPIDER-MAN franchise. Not to mention that fact that Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck are in THE FLASH film, which no one ever could have suspected, so never say never.Happy for Zack as he had to deal with his daughter's suicide and the man literally got paid no money to do this. He worked for everyone who clamored for his cut of the film and he delivered. Fingers crossed that there will be a continuation.\nI'm not ready to call this the best DCEU film yet, but it just might be as its up there and its added to the list of DCEU films I find to be great which includes MAN OF STEEL, SHAZAM, and WONDER WOMAN.9/10", "Best film.": "What should I say, it is so brilliant, that it has left me speechless. This the best film ever. Yeah, I have been changing the best ever from one DC film to another. I'm not going to give a spoiler about the end of the film, but the ending certainly says that there will be another awesome sequel. I'm really excited.", "8 star plus 1 star": "So the movie not perfect, still fell epic\nthis have more time but less boring in cinema version.\nfor the story I give it 8/10 score,plus 1 score for people who sporting Synder made this movie to be ture.", "Absolutely Brilliant movie.

We want Zack snyders version of the movies !!! So please give us more !!!", "This is an absolute gem. This is a pivotal moment. I'm so happy I'm able to witness it.": "This movie in my minds eye is an absolute masterpiece. And the messed up thing is.. It couldve even been better the first time around if Zach was able to do what he wanted. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie because of the aspect ratio, film length, or poor cgi can all get bent. I will laugh in their face at their own opinions. They are simply words in the wind that don't know anything about the DCEU or film.", "Great Movie But Very Long": "I enjoyed seeing this movie although it is 4 hours long. It cleared up a lot of loose ends for the fans. If you're a man with an enlarged prostate, stay close to the bathroom and don't drink a lot of liquids.

It comes to cliff hangers Snyder sir really impressed me a lot how a movie of superhero is that good and dark in seriousness..and this movie is very much better than endgame in comparison of seriousness so we as a fan really want to see another trilogy of justice league of 4 hours runtime like lord of the rings please Warner Bros please let the fans relieve this epic justice league and please restore the Snyder Verse because we want to see Justice league Apokalips war in live action and no better director than Zack Snyder is understand the fan demand in better way like Snyder does because if u let the Zack Snyder complete his visions then it definitely become the #1 movie of the world Zack Snyder's Justice league ..\nPlease Dc fans support and start petition on #restore the Snyder Verse...\n#henrycavillisoursuperman\n#benaffleckisourbatman\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Awesome movie": "The 2017 justice league was missing a lot of stuff but Synder cut did justice to justice league", "The Best": "Best DCEU movie.. this movie is a lot better than i expected...the flash and cyborg characters is my favorite in this film...i hope the JL2 and 3 would possible...i hope they restore the snyderverse...", "Perfectly Crafted": "I don't need to tell you what is good and what is great about this movie, because everyone pretty much tell everything I need to say.\nThis is a literal masterpiece of art.\nThis is everything I wanted from Justice League.", "This is what DC fans have wanted for years.": "This movie actually made sense compared to the 2017 tragedy.", "His best work since Watchmen": "To pretend this is the same movie from 2017 and that Snyder's version is not the superior version is naive and plain wrong.At the end of the day you may not like the movie even after finally watching it and thats fine. However, Its not just about the quality of the movie but artistic integrity as well.Zack Snyder and his vision was disrespected and betrayed by warner brothers and Joss Whedon at a time where he and his family was in absolute distress and the studio and Whedon should be ashamed. If there's hope the DCEU can be saved its with Zack Snyder.I sincerely hope they green light a sequel.Snyder provides a powerful action packed emotional ride. Full of decent effects, fight sequences, and Little to no cheesy dialogue.", "What We Wanted": "Gone are the immature jokes and desperate attempts to Marvel-ize the DCEU. We all love Marvel, but Zack gave us a different vision with MoS and BvS. A deeper look at the dark nature of villainy and its effects on our heroes. In this, we are given a world where crime is violent and un-compromised. It earns its R rating, but not for the sake of being edgy.Wonder Woman is done justice and has some of the best action scenes in the whole film. Cyborg finally gets his story told and his power and character become all the more interesting for it. Aquaman has a more natural flow into his solo film. The Flash offers some epic scenes, as well as some great comedic relief. Batman shows his heart for family in a more appropriate progression this time. And of course, we have our new Superman who is allowed time to develop into his second chance before joining the fight. Which brings us to Steppenwolf and the villains. He not only looks better and more memorable, but is also given a character arc worth watching.Ultimately, we are given the Justice League we deserved. Well worth the wait and certainly worth the runtime!", "What a complete mess": "A complete mess, stupid storyline, so many things that dont make sense.", "Finally Zack delivers JUSTICE to the LEAGUE!!": "Amazing, splendid, mind blowing. These are the woods that come to my mind after watching the Snyder cut. Waaaaay better than the original in terms of character development and the story actually makes sense. The reasoning for each member to be part of the team , the pain the suffering the triumph (Supes entry into the final fight is literally goosebumps)...enuf said. Amazing to see Darksied and DeSaad show up and can't wait for more. Way to go Zack!!!!!!", "Zack Snyder is a kino-prophet.": "Justice League is a masterpiece as a movie, and a message to the people, he resurrected a whole franchise with one movie, and gave great cliffhangers for future films, it makes you anticipate, and on the story side, you can see a lot of metaphors, trying to warn us about our future, and that we must unite against evil on all levels, from our thoughts and actions, to our soul and energy", "It's a good movie way to long": "To long and they just repeat every thing each year also it's repetitive and the only think I can say they put it in parts is good also the action good did feel the darkness really unnecessary.", "It's better but...": "So the Snyder Cut is far superior to what came out in 2017... that being said...It's still kind've a lifeless, boring movie. Overstuffed with characters - sure there is time for them in the 4 hour runtime... but they don't really serve a purpose to moving a story forward.This movie wanted to be avengers and launch a bunch of solo films... but it all felt superfluous to the main story. The introduction to Aquaman was great... concise... same with Barry... cyborg was a little too drawn out... and the whole \"Superman flies Lois to the farm... totally unneeded and dull. And everything that happens at the end of the film... so pointless.Lego's joker is bad... it's good we have never got to see much of it. Amber Heard's British accent is so bad - it's clear that she got this role because of Depp... 1,000 British actors could have played it better... heck, 1,000 American actors could have done a better accent.My biggest gripe... whether it is Megatron, Thanos, Steppenwolf, Darkseid.... Or any other super hero movie villain from outer space... Hollywood has gotten far too reliant on CGI bad guys that still look like video games cutscenes as opposed to real footage of a real being. It just makes you feel like your watching a video game... it is boring and you never really feel scared/intimidated/threatened. The character was a lot better than what it was in the first movie... but still.Also? Can superhero movies PLEASE stop with the \"we have to save the world... the world is going to end... they're gone destroy the UNIVERSE!\"They went to big too soon. Every movie is about saving the world from a more epic threat and it just carries no weight. It's meaningless. Why not take on some more localized threats and back off on the superhero powers so that they actually have to put in some effort on beating up ordinary people.The one thing that\nReally gets\nUnder\nMy skins is that\nPeople that work for these companies don't say\"Hey maybe we tone it down a bit so their powers are still super awesome but we can give them some local threats and be like\nMovie 1: this person is in danger\nMovie 2: this group is in danger\nMovie 3 the city is in danger\nMovie 4: The country is in danger!Movie 5: the continent is in danger!!Movie 6: the world is in danger!!!Movie 7: THE UNIVERSE IS IN DANGER!That's like 15-20 years worth of movies where the threat level (midnight) is different each time and keeps it fresh.", "The Justice League is back": "Certainly and another film, I was expecting to see the film in two parts thinking that it would not hold my attention, I was wrong, Snyder knows what he does, if the WB executives left it with those who know it would not have happened, if this movie were presented to us in 2017 even the avengers' glow would be less, waiting for JL 2 soon", "What should i say? this is just Fckng AWSOM": "This is Epically Insane...Nothing to say.. just sit down and watch this movie, its take you to a another world... finally justice has been served", "The first very good DC movie!!! My top 3 superhero movies!": "First of all - congrats to Zack Snyder - he really tried , he even talks in the beginning of the movie explaining with passion how he made it and why. I really appreciate this small detail and I hope he will continue with the franchise. The movie is for sure 10 times better than the 2017 version. It would have been amazing if this is the version that I see first, because I would not know the plot, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Too much effort is put in - it's massive, too long, but the story is quite good, well delivered with these chapters too, amazing villain (great acting there) visuals are done well and it just keeps you hooked, not to mention Superman - he is as awesome as it gets. The fighting scene, especially the final one is supreme - it is just a pleasure to watch! I also love the movie ratio. Not bad at all. Now what I didn't like:Why the epic music every time when Wonder Woman enters the scene? Why is every movement that she makes so strongly feminized and exaggerated? Definitely the most annoying scenes for me in the whole movie and the main reason why I am not giving a higher score.\nThe Amazonian warriors tales originate from Greece and there are no people of color in the myths, just because Balkan people are mostly light in skin color, so no people of color also in real life in that area. Historical fact. Since I am coming from East Europe I can assure you that this adding of different characters of different races just for the sake of having them in the movie (like in many other movies nowadays) is just annoying and they are making a point, but the opposite point.\nA lot of slow mo and close up face scenes - again, exaggerated.\nGood soundtrack, but again - exaggerated and over the top in some places.\nMera's accent - why?Don't waste your time on the 2017 version- go straight to this one!", "Epic.. Way better than theatrical": "When I saw BVS Ultimate Edition vs BVS theatrical cut, I realized how interfering with a director's vision, destroys the film. I watched JL 2017 and felt something's not right with what I saw and started to hope to see Zack's vision. Now, after watching without breaks, it never felt like a four hour, 7 chapter film. An epic masterpiece from Zack Snyder. Definitely worth the wait!!!WB restore the snyderverse!!", "Bloated, But In a Good Way": "Too long? Yes. But you don't have to watch it all at once. Better than the \"other\" release? Yes. This tells a different narrative...and one that is darker and much richer. Special effects? Excellent. I actually caught myself several times thinking; \"Wow. That is really quite beautiful.\" Does Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman have the emotional range of a 2x4? That's being generous. Is the \"coda\" the best part of the movie...and what should be the storyline going forward? Emphatically yes.In a nutshell: An excellent, albeit bloated film. Easily could have been 2.5 to 3 hours vs 4. Visually stunning and emotionally engaging.Sadly, we will never get to see this particular vision taken any further.", "Thanks,zack snyder": "I could not find words to express the greatness of this film", "Vindicated!": "Zack Snyder is FINALLY vindicated!!! The movie was great but I felt some of the music choices for certain scenes could have been better which would have made more of an impact!", "Good but why cut so much?": "It was really amazing. Loved it a bunch.... However... So much was actually cut! The funniest parts are almost all missing. And a lot of scenes were changed. Dialog changed. Batman and superman don't say a word to each other in this cut...", "Zack Snyder's Garbage League": "The Batman is everything I wanted. Thank you Matt Reeves, casts and creators! Matt Reeves is The GOAT. Wow I can't believe how perfect this film is! Cinematography is amazing. Score is amazing. Story is amazing. Only 5 minutes of Barry's Joker, but you can see so much potential. Zack Snyder's Garbage League.", "Tears": "Tears of joy filled my eyes, as a die hard DC fan, I was destroyed when the cinema version of this film came out it was trash! But zack has restored my faith in the DC universe there needs to be a second movie!! I need to see more omega beams!", "Emotional superhero movie": "I love all details, this movie very revommended.\nthanks zack, all love", "Unexpectedly excellent.": "I didn't like batman versus superman. As a kid, I'd loved a Frank Miller batman comic that had batman fighting superman, same armored suit aesthetic, but a way way better story - the dark knight returns . The tedious grunt fest that was the movie suffered badly from the comparison. So I wasn't expecting much. The original 'Justice League' was even worse than BvS. It took everything bad from that movie and forgot the engagement, making for an utterly forgettable, tedious and disjointed slug fest. The Snyder cut, though? Its absolutely brilliant. I felt like i was watching a new story. I understood and felt for each of the characters, and there was a real sense of jeopardy. Ok. It is a stupid cape movie, and the themes of them are quite ridiculous, but Snyder still managed to craft a compelling and engrossing story. Steppenwolf went from a one dimensional ranting noise/smash machine into a troubled, desperate and relatable bad guy. The contrast to my vague memories of the Whedon original is telling. Not sure about some of the early exposition - there was a lot of story to fit in, and so at times it was a little clunky. Some of the lighting choices were interesting and daft - Seeing wonder woman step into a bright white downlight as she holds up a burning torch to light a room was hilarious. It also throws out aquaman a little, as now we have to forget that he can go toe to toe with someone nearly as strong as superman. The future vision epilogue was unnecessary, imo, but even the nonsense of the last character introduction, who must mean something to people who read the comics, because it means nothing to me, was offset for the next image. \"For Autumn\". It amazes me that someone can go through that kind of unimaginable personal tragedy and still craft the best movie out of the DC universe. The credits cover of halleluiah was excellentThis could easily have been a two part movie, with the first one ending with the -not spoiling- dude floating above the building. If Warner doesn't use Snyder for future movies, then they are fools. He's learnt to balance the inevitable fighting of comic books with emotionally meaningful exchanges.", "Was OK..": "Was way better than the previous version, I was laughing the entire movie cause when Dian Prince was in the scene, was that song(voice) Aaaaaaaah Aaaaaah \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Better than Age of Ultron": "The movie is totally different from 2017\nI just loved the way Snyder gave each and every character the dept which is needed.The snyderverse is totally started here.I hope Werner brothers see the potential and give him the freedom which he needs.", "Worth a chance to watch \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb": "Thank you zack, that's what we are waiting for, wish to see your next movies!", "Amazing!

It is a handmade thing, if we compare it with the MCU package 'formula', one that doesn't care about commercialism, a bit like these long progressive songs of the early 1970s didn't care about public airplay - just art.Sure, it's got its awkward moments and CGI excess here and there, and yeah, it's a bit long, but after viewing it, one feels like the mission is definitely accomplished. Coming from a MCU fan: Congrats, Mr. Snyder.", "Long is fine, but it has to be engaging": "Who are they fighting to save the planet? Is that Ronan the fanatic and Thanos the supreme destroyer of worlds... but wearing different outfits? The only engaging character is the Flash, his enthusiasm is a treat. All the others with their \"boo hoo, woe is me, I don't want to play\" background stories... good grief, the self pity of these characters just never stops. This desperation from the writers/director for us to feel emotion towards the characters is rendered as a massive downer that continues throughout the movie. We know the goodies will win in the end, of course it needs to be difficult and of course they need to learn to work together as a team - but they don't have to be such sad sacks. You already have so much DC source material to work from... how did you make something that felt like a bleak and humourless retelling of Guardians of the Galaxy? Sorry, aside from the Flash... the characters did not engage me in the story, and I didn't find the 100% CGI Steppenwolf bad guy at all menacing or credible. In a word: boring.", "This is what I wanted for so long time": "I was so exited for this to release and I was always worried about how it could be and I am thankful today because I get what\nI want .

This is a long movie. It did allow me to eat plenty of the snakes I enjoy. I've always liked a long movie as long as the script and characters can support it. This falls a bit short on that, but it sure provides the necessary background for the theatric version. Some of which would have made that movie infinitely better. But, getting back to this one. It is bloated, but still enjoyable.I would have liked to think they could have come up with a better name than \"mother box,\" it seems a bit goofy for a movie that takes itself so serious. Since when can Flash run at light speed? If he could, why couldn't he just keep going back in time to fix things? I know, a paradox, but he still effects time (even a little) in this movie.I really enjoyed the background on Darkseid and Steppenwolf. Having never been much of a DC fan I was not familiar with them. They are well done and very imposing.All in all it's a pretty good movie and a long rainy day. Diane Lane gets more beautiful every year she ages.", "restore the snyderverse now!!!": "Just bring on snyder he is a true fan he will give us epic movies!!!", "The best dc movie ever": "This is best of best story and action all we want more dc movies like this", "So happy we got this.": "I would have sat in the theater for the 4 hours for this. Great movie. Pretty much everything I wanted it to be.", "Giant improvement. This is pretty much what we hoped for": "Ended up watching all 4 hours with no break, and it didn't feel hurtful. so much better than the theatrical release. still a few minor problems, but most movies do. a few odd choices for music, some unnecessarily long bits, Flash's horrible dialogue during his last run, etc. but so many good fixes. cyborg's arc was filled out SO MUCH better. this version was a big win in my book. hopefully WB takes notice of the audience feedback (rather than the critics) and lets this continue", "Much better then the theatrical version": "If you only see this version of Justice League then you won't regret it. It's very long and I doubt this movie would have been released in theatres at this running time but it was never boring. I couldn't watch it all in one sitting however and liked that the movie was divided in parts (6 plus an epilogue) for easy to end points to stop watching. The story is pretty much the same but just longer and more developed. The story was much easier to follow and understood what was actually happening.", "Just one word: EPIC!": "This movie is all what we've been waiting for. Thank you, Zack Snyder! It's so much better than the 2017's version. The story is way more detailed, you understand the villains backstory and their motivation and all the characters have room to grow. The movie takes the time that is needed to bring the heroes together and does not feel as rushed as the old version and does definately not feel like 4 hrs! It's so enjoybale - especially the battle scenes! I loved them! I felt, the heoes where all equal in the final battle and it wasn't like they were just waiting for superman to save them... Moreover the villains look super badass and scary. Steppenwolf does look like an alien monster and not just like some dude with a weird helmet. :-) I really hope that there will be a sequel!

Really well paced, not a minute of its 4 hour run time felt like padding or superfluous. It also didn't feel at all like 4 hours.For me Joss Whedon rarely puts a foot wrong when it comes to his directorial work but I absolutely loathed the JLA cinematic release. Other than 300 and Legend of the Guardians, I haven't enjoyed Zak Snyder's films. Man of Steel was a mess, BVS was saved by the fantastic Batfleck rescue at the end and Watchmen was a painful waste of time.I am now hoping that this cut gets the appreciation it deserves and serves as a renaissance for the DCEU, I would love to see more.", "So DISSAPPOINTED": "Is this what draws the audience? This is not worth calling a movie, it is a trash made by someone who is clearly not a good writer and director. Why are we allowing these sort of stuff? The word \"ART\" is ashamed of this vile industry. Oh and not to mention the repelling and toxic fanbase behind this movie and director. How irresponsible of Snyder and Fisher to not only stay put and say nothing, but also set blaze to the flame while those people create a hateful space online. Nothing about this movie works. Do not waste your time.", "4 hours of slow motion": "Literally! Could have lost an hour+ and still have been the same movie.", "Pathetic": "So bad it actually makes you feel violent.

I can't even explain how happy I am. Thanks Zack Snyder", "Well ... better, but somehow not": "I really wish the first half had been better. The music was inappropriate at times, the changes between locations and characters exhausting, there was too much pathos and too little substance. I didn't think I'd give it more than four stars. But the second half convinced me. The pathos turned into epicness and thrilled me into saying I want to see a sequel. The Snyder Cut doesn't make the mistakes of the theatrical version, makes a few new ones, but clearly remains the more satisfying version.", "Didn't even notice it lasted 4 hours !": "When I first saw the duration I was stunned. Then I was captivated by the comparison with the theatrical release, so much so that I couldn't careless about the duration anymore. As all the scenes were beginning to make sense, I really thought that the theatrical release basically ripped off the soul of the director's work.", "The stupidest Batman ever": "What was he role in this movie again? You don't even feel anything wrong if this character is removed from the movie.", "A CGI mess. Only for fans.": "Way too much use of CGI. Also the 4:3 format really put me off. Beside that it falls into the same Avenger trap: too many character stories in one movie makes it just blend. Only for fans of the Justice League, but for me as a person that enjoys super hero movies like Batman Begins or Zack Snyder's Superman this was a boring disappointment.", "Bloated": "Let this and the Star Wars prequels be a lesson that you do not just let the director do whatever they want, they will cram as much unnecessary stuff in there.

Excellent.": "What was that! A superhero ensemble movie nearly 4 hours long with great character development and I wanted it to be longer!!? How the hell is that possible Zack. Watched with a family member with ADHD, expected them to get bored (with the talkie bits).... Nope. Incredible pacing and development. Only minor criticisms, aspect ratio (almost square), cool in some ways, and there were some sequences that could have been included from the original (that were actually good). These don't stop me awarding this a 10/10. A very different film to the original (which I would have given about a 7.)", "I want more": "The runtime is 4 hours long but every scene feels like an episode in a DC series that never ends!! Every character is more fleshed out than the 2017 original and has a part in fighting the supervillains at the end. In fact, it makes the previous and standalone DCEU videos worth a second watch afterwards.This is probably my favorite DC movie after The Dark Knight and Batman.Congrats to Snyder for finishing this work of art. If he doesn't continue the storyline into where it looks like it's going, that's fine because this was a ball of love that I'll be watching every year.", "Best Movie of the Decade": "This movie is just Awesome......

It stands up there with the dark knight trilogy, infinity war and the rest of the greats. I found myself cheering at certain points in the movie.

This movie is a little bittersweet cause now I want Justice League 2 and 3 so see Zacks full vision. Oh well, I just hope the executives at Warner Bros are taking notice cause this is the content that the fans want.", "masterpiece!": "I fking love this film.this is how comic book movie should be.", "Just wow!!!": "The movie is just perfect! Best superhero movie ever...", "Awesome superhero epic!": "Ben Affleck's superhero films are great examples of editing making or breaking films! Zack Snyder was the original director for Justice League but he left due to a family tragedy so Joss Whedon replaced him. Whedon rewrote and reshot the film making it lighthearted and safe. The Whedon Cut was released in November 2017 and it became the biggest box office bomb! I understand why fans hated the film, I thought it was okay. HBO Max was launching so Warner kindly allowed Snyder to finish his cut which finally arrived! The Snyder Cut is awesome, it's a superhero epic!Yes, it has the same plot as the Whedon Cut only extended. The film is four hours long but it feels like two and a half hours! The film has six chapters and an epilogue. Why four hours? To develop the characters mainly Cyborg who is the heart of the film. His backstory was really murky in the Wheadon Cut since it had to be only two hours long. No, the plot didn't warrant four hours but I prefer characters over plot.Justice League is dark but not depressing, it's lighter than Snyder's previous DC films. The film has some humor mostly from Barry Allen who acts like a teenager. Yeah, the humor works but I never laughed out loud. The film has heart mostly due to Cyborg but I never felt emotional.The action scenes are epic! Yes, the climax is better than the Whedon Cut's climax! I heard Batman basically sits on the sidelines since he's a normal guy but that's not true. The stakes are really high in fact the team feels challenged. The film is bloody but it's tamer than Watchmen. The effects are mixed, there's some dodgy CGI.Overall, Justice League is a fun superhero epic! I think everyone prefers it over the Whedon Cut. It's creative, weird and character driven. Maybe the film's heart will touch me eventually. Don't worry about the four hour runtime, take at least one break. The film ends on a cliffhanger but it shouldn't annoy anyone. I'm sure the fans will campaign for the sequels maybe as early as next week. Who knows? HBO Max may announce only one sequel. I think you should see Justice League regardless how you feel about the Whedon Cut. Keep in mind it's not family friendly.", "Long but worth it": "Amazing, movie is just what was missing. No pun intended.", "Finally, Justice for the Justice League!!!": "This is the movie we've all been eagerly anticipating, but denied. The reasons for why this version had almost never seen the light of day hint a set of Godfather-like circumstances. It's as if someone(s) had meant to sabotage and quite possibly tank the entire franchise. Even now with all it's new found success, there is still NOT the sure promise of continuity a la Synder's visionary leadership from producers and other industry-heads. Maybe this will change as the fandom continues to weigh in. Let's hope so!Anyway, this second iteration was everything that the first was not! It was cohesive, theatrical, and even grandiose at times. The scenes melded together and built upon one another, the way a good seamless plot is suppose too. This made it an absolute joy to witness the development of some of the major DC characters such that four hours felt more like two.Presently, Justice League does not hold a candle to Marvel's Endgame, but given the numerous setbacks it's had to endure compared to the level of investment Marvel has been pouring in was to be expected. This notwithstanding, fans and newcomers alike will appreciate the improvements.", "Sometimes, Less Is More": "It was okay. Snyder didn't lay an egg like he did with Batman Vs Superman, but he also didn't make a better movie than what we already saw. The movie is essentially the same despite the new footage, and I could definitely see why the original was only half the runtime of the Snyder Cut. A lot of the new stuff is just Snyder being overzealous with his world building. It is mostly unnecessary considering the original 2017 version gets the same points across with half the time. Also, I found that a good bit of the new footage seemed to be in random parts of the movie because they couldn't find a natural inclusion for it in the first place. There are good moments, sure. However, considering they were the exact same moments from the original, I find it hard to give this movie credit for merely replaying the hits so to speak.Regardless, Snyder made a movie that falls into the upper tier of the DCEU simply because it's not awful. It is definitely not anything to worship, or marvel at either. If you like it, you like it. Vice versa for if you hate it. I would take all the 10/10 reviews you see with a grain of salt though.", "Brought back to life": "Want to begin with saying thank you the fans for pushing Zack Snyder completing this masterpiece!

Compared to Joss Wheadons Frankenstein of a movie, the Snyder Cut provides a thrilling and emotional story into the lives of the justice league. Barry, who was simply annoying and scared, now had a goal and a reason to be scared. Cyborg/Victor seemed like an overly broody and depressed character, which we now see were absolutely valid. Now lets talk about the villains. Steppenwolf now has incredible CGI and his new battle armour looks terrifying. As well as a fresh set of CGI, Steppenwolf has a fresh set of motivation as his struggles become those of emotion, not physicality. And glorious Darkseid. Darkseid is absolutely and utterly terrifying. In the multiple Knightmare sequences, he is everything we've been wanting to see in Darkseid on the big screen. I also have to commend the special fx team for their brilliant work in upgrading the justice league from what it was to what it is now. There's not much else I can say other than please watch it. We've been parading and petitioning for this movie for years and now it is finally here and it is glorious.

What stands out is how every superhero has their story, especially WW where her true powers are displayed and Cyborg really was equal instead of a background member. I went back and watched the other theatrical version and although fun, it was no comparison to this ultimate one. It is a long view so watch one half at a time if 4 hours would deter you or stop between chapters like a series. I don't think this could have been shown in theaters due to the length so really grateful this was made for the DC fans and HBOmax showing it. I wouldn't compare DC to Marvel and think both have their own style so long as it entertains and makes you happy.", "Zack Snyder single handedly saved the entire DC Universe with this movie.": "This is one of the most glorious, epic, intensely story driven movie I have ever seen.

Just wish we had this back in 2017.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League by Zack Snyder": "Telling stories where a group of superheroes who can together accomplish wonders for the humanity, after each of them have faced in the past some of their biggest missions in their own ways; once each of them find out they are not alone, they would meet each other. Later on, it would be seen how the team of superheroes get along with each other, by having sometimes disagreements to be conflictual; but once the conflict has been solved, they move forward with their missions together and see how far they would go, to arrive to an end. After it has been seen in the DCEU some superhero solo movies, inevitably the heroes of DC will meet each other and face together some of the greatest missions they have ever seen. After the visionary filmmaker Zack Snyder has released the movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, he immediately went to work on Justice League. During the postproduction of Justice League, Zack Snyder and Deborah Snyder stepped down to face a family tragedy, which the filmmaker Joss Whedon was lately called to finish the movie. But when the movie Justice League came out in 2017, several fans and critics have been not satisfied with the result of the story; several fans in social media have demanded the director's cut of Justice League, by writing the hashtag \"Release the Snyder Cut\". After years of waiting, Zack Snyder came back in production to finish his director's cut of Justice League, by adding few new scenes to make the movie complete. After a long time of work, in 2021 came out Zack Snyder's Justice League by Zack Snyder with Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. The movie's plot: After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) are recruiting a team of metahumans, to protect the Earth from an ancient threat, which can cause an apocalypse if it is not prevented. As there have been some expectations, for how the movie would come out, because of the unseen footage which have been not used in the theatrical version; once the unseen footage have been assembled together, step by step, the movie would not stop to surprise the audience, from the beginning to the end. By balancing the atmospheres of the movie, which is filled with emotional moments as well as thrilling ones to be unforgettably epic. The production designer Patrick Tatopoulos has created the settings of the story, with specific mythological look which make the settings huge; especially for the way the main characters and the supporting ones would step in, by expressing their emotions among the spaces of the settings. The costume designer Michael Wilkinson has elaborated the costumes with particular details, which connect with the way the emotions of the characters are expressed and the way they take actions; especially in some of the most important moments they are facing, to be often times difficult. The cinematographer Fabian Wagner has captured some of the most essential shots, in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots; by even getting helped with the lightings and the shadows, which make the scenes more atmospheric as well as more uniquely powerful. The editor David Brenner has elaborated the narration's rhythm, which makes clear how the story would be told, with unexpected moments to be surprising; without being repetitive, as the editing has used some of the most essential footage to show, which is usually difficult to choose the right ones, when a movie is specifically very long. The visual effects have been elaborated to create some of the most spectacular scenarios, in the most detailed way; especially in some of the most complicated visual moments, to have a mythological look which works to be unique for the eyes of the audience. The score by Tom Holkenborg a.k.a. Junkie XL, has been elaborated for some of the most surprising moments of the movie; as the musical notes would come out epic, emotional and thrilling to be unforgettable. Ben Affleck did an extraordinary performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, a wealthy socialite that dresses up as a dark vigilante, who would do anything to move forward with what Superman has tried to bring to the humanity; once there is an ancient threat in Earth, Batman with the rest of metahumans would do anything to protect home. Henry Cavill did an excellent performance as Clark Kent/Superman, a Kryptonian who after has sacrificed for the humanity, the team of metahumans would try to bring him back to life; by hoping he would help the team, to finish what he has started. Jason Momoa did a marvelous performance as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, a half Atlantean and half human who would initially not believe, he can do something important for the humanity; until he would change his mind, to use all of his strength to save home. Gal Gadot did an excellent performance as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, an immortal Amazonian warrior who once realizes an ancient threat comes to destroy Earth, she would help Bruce Wayne to find the metahumans; even there would be initially difficulties, to convince some of the metahumans to take part of the team. Ezra Miller did an extraordinary performance as Barry Allen/The Flash, a young student who has the ability to run with the highest speed of the world, by even have the ability to go back in time; as Barry hopes to help his father who has been incarcerated, he would do anything to do the right thing, including for the team, even he would realize it is a difficult task to face the great danger. Ray Fisher did a marvelous performance as Victor Stone/Cyborg, a cyborg who after has been through some of the most dramatic events, he would help to commit with all of his strength anything that is necessary for good. Ciar\u00e1n Hinds did an excellent performance as Steppenwolf, a New God who follows his purpose to bring apocalypse in the Planet Earth, which he has to conquer it; as he take actions, with the help of the army of Parademons, to be merciless with all of the brutal decisions he takes. Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the greatest movies of all time, which is filled with epic moments to be thrilling as well as moving to be unforgettable.", "Superior in every way to the 2017 film": "This isn't a directors cut/extended edition...this is a whole new film. It blows the 2017 film out of the water. The four hours sounds daunting but it was great from start to finish and tells its story so much better than the 2017. You can really tell Snyder put his heart and soul into this. Where as the 2017 film was a soulless hack that was the result of WB bigshots meddling and an uncaring director who disregarded Snyders work in favor of his own junk. So worth the watch!", "Wow, actually worsens the original": "Pretentious is not a good word, but does adequately describe this travesty.The first half hour wasn't bad, after that it is a hodgepodge of nonsensical scene changes, and does Wonder Woman have Flash like speed or not.I mean she seems to have super speed when she wants to for \"film entertainment\" but when she could really use it for functionality it altogether vanishes???This is just one aspect of mis cues in this \"remake\"", "Is it better than original? Yes.. is it mindblowing? NO": "It's overhype everywhere.. you can watch this film and expect to be better than the original... but keep your expectation low because the bad script, poor dialogue, plot holes, and unnecessary scene is still there.", "Forget what you saw before...": "Forget the \"Joss\"tice League, this is the movie both the fans and the story deserved. The #SnyderCut is a masterpiece. I can only say if you're a fan of comics and this world that's been built than it's a must see. Good on Zach to see his vision through in the face of tragedy.

Who at WB thought it was a good idea to ditch this beautiful piece of art for Joss Whedon's hack job?\nThank you Zack and Deborah Snyder for this truly mind blowing cinematic experience.\nSo hard to review this film as it goes beyond words!... Oh and Tom Holkenborg's score is just absolutely incredible!", "Mind blowing adaptation ever": "I can't explain how epic it is...\nI will just say we got our prize.....", "I am so disappointed!": "Firstly the performances in this film definitely vary quite a bit but they all seem to stride towards the \"less good\" side. Even Henry Cavill (who is a terrific actor) couldn't seem to jump on the beat the story was going for. My main complaint with the performances, however, is Gal Gadot. She has absolutely no talent whatsoever and whenever she tries to convey any sign of real human emotion I just want to die and take her with me. The only reason she probably got the role in the first place is because she looks like Wonder Woman but nonetheless she isn't convincing at all as the heroin and instead presents the character as an annoying person who doesn't seem to have a grip on how humans work. Now although most of the performances were mediocre (to say the least) some people really shines through, my main example being Joe Manganiello who was an amazing choice as deathstroke (a character were the casting could've easily been messed up). The same also applies to (surprisingly) Jared Leto, I hated his portrayal of the joker in suicide squad but somehow going forward a more subtly insane and limitless version of the clown Prince of crime has given him a new level of understanding to the character, which I think has allowed him to embody the joker in a not perfect but also not disappointing way.Secondly I want to talk about the story. All I can say about the story is why is it so long! Most of the film I had already seen in the original Whedon Justice League with the only differences being more blood, a darker colour palate and the occasional f-bomb. There were some scenes which could have easily been cut away and it wouldn't have affected the story in any way, shape or form and I can see how Snyder really wanted to go full out with this film because of all the buzz around it but it just flies to close to the sun and just like Icarus falls to its doom. However, even though it was 4 hours I can safely say that even if I didn't necessarily love a scene I was never properly bored, I always had an ear listening even if I was trying to focus on something else. I also loved the the involvement of Darkseid, which wasn't much but was enough to fulfil my fanboy needs. Unfortunately the story was muddled for most of the time and it didn't seem like it had a clear outline of where it wanted the story to go, this clearly affected the other aspects just as much as not really knowing where it can go really limited the acting and the writing. Speaking of the writing it wasn't too good, with the dialogue I got what I would expect from any big budget superhero flick; cheesy jokes, \"look at me I'm cool\" lines and things that actually moved the story forwards.And finally I did actually like the style Snyder went with here. The dark palate did compliment the cinematography, which made sure that each frame actually looked phenomenal for a comic book film and almost symbolised a painting of sorts. That being said the frames where all that was existent was decent cgi really looked rather off putting and yes I did still enjoy the action but it just didn't look like it was done with a lot of care. Also I kinda have to include just how wholesome the film and Zack Snyder's involvement are because instead of just being a cool story about a film you could really sense the passion Snyder tried to apply to this, he did it all and although it wasn't really for me I think he achieved what he set out to do and truly did it for the fans. The soundtrack was pretty damn good as well but why did they feel it was fine for there to be a scream/chant every time Wonder Woman did even the smallest thing. Coming in with a bang, there is no denying, that the action sequences were terrific, they were thrilling and exciting to watch and kind of swept me away for a moment before I remembered all the cons of the film.My final rating\n4/10.", "Aggressively mediocre at best": "Its way too long, not that funny, terribly paced, boring to look at and an all around drag to be honest", "Waste of four hours": "I don't recommend this movie even don't deserve a -1 star", "I hated BVS, I hated Joss-tice league. Yet I believe this is one of the best super hero films of all time": "So I grew up as a huge marvel fan. The first film I saw in theaters was Spider-Man 3, I saw every mcu film opening night. Yet I have never really been fond of the DC films other than the dark knight trilogy.But once I heard there's a 4 hour Justice Leagur epic that's much better than the theatrically released one, I figured why not. Nothing else on, probably just an average DC film.I was wrong.This film is amazing. It has a sense of dread and urgency right off the bat. Like something is happening. We meet each character individually and they develop their own individual arch's throughout. And all of them were perfect for their characters, and honestly made me want to see sequels of them continuing to develop.I feel though that the best thing the film did was improve upon every fault of BVS, and forget that Joss-tice League even exists. The pacing, characters, music, plot, setup for future projects, all of it felt like it was made with love and passion, not wanting cool fights between Batman and Superman or just an average film to be pushed out the door to make a quick buck.It felt like Zack put his all into this film. And it really does show.", "Great movie has its flaws but still great": "The movie is great I feel like it's problem is it got too much hype than any movie can meet up to. The movie is great but its super long and extends parts of the movie longer than it has to be. Even thought it feels a little long at times it's a great movie. My only problem with the snyderverse is since we know the story of how the snyderverse will go it may lose my attention if they are all 4 hours.", "This can't be the end": "There are a couple of all time superhero movie scenes in this film. A brisk, entertaining 4 hour watch, I'm surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did because I despised the first justice league, it was terrible. This earns its place in the top tier of super hero movies ever. Continue the snyderverse, he deserves it.", "Masterpiece from Zack Snyder": "Just a mind-blowing super hero movie.... I want the sequel ... Love u Zack Snyder", "This is the film that we should of seen in the first place!": "ZSJL is no question a massive improvement from the 2017 Theatrical version. Zack's vision of the Justice League is dark, twisted, brutal but brilliant. The original version was too campy and tried to act like a Marvel movie. Zack's version is more faithful to the DC comic books that I and many fans grown to love. Steppenwolf is more menacing and his character is more memorable in the Snyder cut. Superman's resurrection feels more emotional and feels overall right and necessary. The under appreciated part of the whole movie in my opinion is Cyborg, played by the fantastic Ray Fisher. Cyborg's story is chilling and tragic. So well told and well acted. This film is a overall great superhero film and I hope that Zack Snyder gets to create more of his vision in future films. Bravo Zack and Deborah! This is a beautiful film!", "Not bad": "Definitely better than previous Snyder films out all the good pieces from pervious films into one and filled in the gaps but there wanst enough new content to account for a higher rating from me", "Overall Excellent Film!": "Very character driven. Great pacing and CGI. Superb cinematography. Overall Excellent Film. Better than 2017 version in every way. I am not a huge superhero movie fan but this one is one of the best superhero movie ever.", "A much better film": "My feelings are so mixed. On one hand, I'm very happy that Zack Snyder got to complete his vision in the way he intended, but on the other hand I'm not entirely thrilled with that vision. There's no doubt in my mind that this is a better version of the movie, but many of the theatrical cut's flaws carried over to the Snyder Cut in ways that I wasn't expecting.First, things I liked.I liked the lack of obvious Joss Whedon reshoots. I loved the lack of CGI Cavill face. I love Gadot as Wonder Woman, and I really appreciated what they did with Superman's character. Even though there isn't as much of him in the film as I would have liked, it seems that Superman has finally become \"Superman\". I still believe that Cavill could just NAIL this character if he was given the right script.I appreciated the overall expansion of everyone's backstories. It made the characters feel fuller and more three-dimensional. That was especially beneficial to Cyborg and The Flash, since neither of them have solo films to lean on for context.I love Steppenwolf's redesign. He's much more menacing looking here than in the theatrical cut. I have no idea what they were thinking when they replaced him for the theatrical version. I loved seeing Darkseid, as well.I'm sure there are some other things that I'm failing to mention, but that's the gist. Now, for what did not work for me...I just don't like Affleck's Batman. I think Affleck COULD be a good Batman, but the character has been totally mischaracterized in a way that I don't think I realized until watching this film. Affleck plays Batman less as a stoic, cynical man of mystery, as he is in the comics, and more as a humorous hopeful. There's a scene that comes to mind that displays exactly what I mean. Alfred is talking to Bruce about how the odds are against him in being able to revive Superman, and Bruce responds by simply replying that he has faith it'll work...Now, I thought about that for a while and it occurred to me that those opinions are held by exactly the opposite people that they should be. Batman is not a man of faith. He doesn't have faith in anything except facts and logic. Alfred is typically the person in his life that tries to remind and instill in him those sort of abstract concepts of hope, faith, love, etc. In a lot of ways, Alfred helps keep Bruce from losing his soul. It is entirely backward for Alfred to be the pessimist and Bruce to be the optimist. It's just not in character. Batman is the kind of person who keeps precise contingency plans on how to kill his friends if and when they go rogue. He doesn't trust anyone. Absolutely nobody. Yet in this film, we see him, on many occasions, willingly give his real name and identity to strangers and not think twice about the consequences. Bruce Wayne is reckless in this film in a way that Bruce Wayne of the comics never was, never has been, and never would be.Now, I know that it's not really a criticism of the film itself to say \"It's not like the comics\". There have been plenty of films that diverge from their source material and are still great, or perhaps even better, but for me personally, I just can't really buy this Batman.I also felt that Barry's humor was pretty overplayed. I was actually quite surprised by several of the lame quips that are in here, as I thought many of them were surely Whedon rewrites. The scene where Bruce introduces himself to Barry in Barry's lair was just dumb. I couldn't believe that was shot by Snyder.I was taken aback at first by the fact that General Swanwick was revealed as being Martian Manhunter all along. That was pretty cool, but it was little more than a tease for sequels that don't seem to be happening. Either way, that was a cool little reveal that recontextualizes the previous films in a fun way.The climax was okay. Not great. Not bad. The Flash saves the day in a pretty awesome way and the forces of evil are defeated... For now.\nOverall, it's okay; far better than the theatrical cut. But, regardless of its superiority, it failed to leave a strong impact on me. Even Man of Steel and Batman v Superman left me feeling strong emotions, both good and bad. This one just feels so weak by comparison, and I'm not exactly sure why. Regardless, it's still quite watchable, especially for something this long.Not a masterpiece, but certainly an improvement over the butchered theatrical cut.", "The World has Hope again": "Firstly this film is what the DCEU is all about, Zach had a vision that he said would take 5 movies to see the full story arc of Superman.Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Justice League , Justice League 2 and finally Man of Steel 2These movies would have seen the rise, fall, death and rebirth of Superman until he becomes the final form Superman that people had experienced with Christopher Reeve.I hope WB are taken to hand by HBO Max and AT&T and we see the continuation of the Snyderverse.The movie has several points which made me tear up, Cyborg is the heart and soul of this movie and watch Ray Fisher bring Victor Stone to life in this movie is absolutely amazing. You see his pain and struggles and his massive heart he has. The scene at the cashpoint bought the tears the first time.Batman is amazing and he brings the team together amazingly, he has forgotten the hate he has for the world and can see there is a place for good and he now has faith that they can do it.Wonder Woman is just amazing, her scenes where she can unload and you see her abilities just had me on the edge of my seat wanting to see her kick a**. She is a pillar in this film just like Bruce and their scenes together show the comradery and belief they can make a difference.Barry Allen brings most of the humour and it is timed perfectly, his quips are excellent, between him and Cyborg they are the key to this movie and saving our world.Aquaman is the 1 that is watching from the back of the theatre, you think why is he here. Then the final fight scene he is the boss with his trident.Alfred is Bruce's conscious, he is always there with a counter to Bruce's thoughts and it helps in the movie with the decision making of the team.Superman is who i came to watch and even though he is only in 1/4 of the movie, what he is in just made my day. The scene at the farm between him, his mum and Lois melted me to tears. It is beautiful. I am also glad that Zak Snyder finally allowed the world to se the full force of a Super Punch and Kick..The big reveals in this movie will knock your socks off, simple put they were there from the very beginning.This movie is my absolute favourite superhero movie of all time, it has taken the title from Superman 2 - The Donner Cut.Knowing this movie was put together before Endgame, you can see aspects of this movie that were leaked to Marvel to be put in Endgame. There are quite a few.The Epic Mythology scene is simply majestic and sits up there with the LotR trilogy for battle scenes.thankyou AT&T and HBO Max for allowing this movie to be finished and released and allowing the fans to see the vision and dream Zack Snyder had for the DCEU.Lets hope he is greenlit for the other movies and we can see the finally of this dream.i rate this 10/10", "I want more JL 2 snider": "#JL 2 Zack.

Better pacing, better characters development, better lines, better cinematography.\nThis movie now has heart, visionery superhero movie, a beautiful piece of art. It is grand, an absolute epic!", "Outstanding movie. So much more heart in it": "This is easily the superior film. It explains so much more. I am now actually looking forward to seeing DC move forward with these characters instead of shelving Snyder's . After a movie like this it would be a huge mistake on WBs part to start over yet again. Snyder's cut showed why his way is the right way and the studio needs to let him do it his way. The plot development is 10 times better in this film. The characters are way more likable. Even the villains arc is drastically improved in this film. Zack and his team should be proud of this film. It is a wonderful film and one I will watch for as long as I'm around.", "This is what it should be!": "It literally has a very good narrative and plot. He makes good use of his time. They have beautiful scenes. You don't even feel the emptiness of the characters, you can understand their motivations. There are very good references.", "Everything was wrong!": "I love superheroes movies, but this one was the worst I've even seen. The story was wrong, the script was wrong, Ben Aflek was wrong, the action scenes were wrong .. and dumb! If this is the future of cinema we are all doomed. Watch it - and you will see that even the raiting here is wrong.", "Better than I could possibly have imagined.": "Wow! There is a LOT to talk about here. Before even reviewing the film itself, you have to discuss the issues around it. Is it a moral victory for an artist's vision restored, or is it a sign of the times that a studio caved to the demands of a loud (and often very toxic) fanbase, appeasing them with a film that in this form, would never have been shown in a cinema?\nThere are the issues that have come to light around Whedon's on set antics and Fisher's apparent ejection from the future of the DCEU. Whether Whedon will face any consequences, Fisher's fortunes will be restored and what this film would have looked like in a cinema had fate not dealt Snyder that terrible blow, perhaps we will never know.\nWhat we are left with is essentially a four hour mini-series, presented in 4:3, which to me lends it much less of a cinematic quality. Whether you like this film or not, what is inarguable is it's a fascinating look into how two directors can take what is essentially the same story and a lot of the same exact takes of a lot of footage, but still produce two such radically different films.\nI for one enjoyed Whedon's cut. It gave me something BvS didnt: colour, humour and superheroes who actually seemed to enjoy being superheroes. It is fair to say, however, that his version is messy. Obviously new scenes and entire new plot lines jar with the overall tone; a lot of the humour is backloaded onto an already comedic character in Barry Allen and overall, it doesn't have much in the sense of stakes or even feel that super.\nHere Snyder rights a lot of those wrongs. The addition of Darkseid and the increased screen time of Steppenwolf plus his new design add a much needed sense of global and universal danger. Whilst never challenging Thanos in the bad guy stakes, you at least feel there is a need for the League to assemble. And then there is the super element. Boy does this team feel super. Snyder always said he wanted to give his characters a sense of mythology and a godlike nature, and here, he succeeds. The best beneficiaries of this cut are Flash and Cyborg, who's characters are given so much more depth and heart and whose powers are explored to superb effect. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are likewise granted much better action scenes to showcase their abilities (it could easily be argued, however, that Diana in particular is far more brutal than she should be or is in the hands of Patty Jenkins). And Superman's return is absolutely fantastic here. The black suit adds nothing but he is shot in such a way as to make it clear he is the ultimate power in the team. A hugely important element that BvS lacks is a sense of fun. Here the whole cast seem to revel in playing heroes. They have backstory, heart, humour and a genuine sense of camaraderie that didn't come across in the Whedon cut. At four hours, it is definitely too long. It is divided into sections and can be watched in chunks. Some of the scenes are pointless and should've been removed, but it's a small price to pay when the action is this good.\nAmy Adams and Diane Lane get very little to do sadly. If there is a Man of Steel 2, I hope Lois is the Lois of the first movie. A feisty journalist who is Clark's equal.\nThe epilogue is very odd and clearly thrown in as fan service and as a bridge to the weirder scenes in BvS. But at four hours long, you can afford a bit of fan-service. Without them, this never would have seen the light of day.", "Every one deserve this. AWESOME WORK": "Thah's what we all wanted! Let Synder do this.New heros new actions better scenes better effects. This is really good guys. Just wanted to say, Thank You Zack Snyder.", "Superb": "Totally different film\nThank you Zack\nStunning ... everything I wanted.", "EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED": "Well I knew the movie is going to be a good movie didn't expect the movie to be so much great better than my expectation.. the movie is completely different from what we saw back in 2017. This is the movie we deserved as DC fans.", "It was good": "Not the best superhero film, but pretty good for DC.. the ending was unnecessary", "Rating Went from 10 to 1...": "This movie was fantastic, in so many aspects- BUT they had to ruin it with profanity. Why directors & producers have to inject profanity into an otherwise excellent film is beyond me. Actually, I do the reason; it's because they're trying to normalize profanity, vulgarity, obscenity, debauchery, etc... AT THE EXPENSE OF STANDARDS & MORALITY.Had it not been for the numerous \"F' bombs\" in this film, I'd likely have given it a 8 or even a 9. Instead, they get a lowered Rating, lost revenue from viewers & Blu-ray sales...", "Zack.....my man": "Zack Snyder....you beauty. This is the most gorgeous superhero movie ever made. Joss wheaden should go to jail for what he did to JL.\nBut thanks to millions of fans and thanks to the creative in WB, they helped Zack to implement his vision. Very beautifully crafted movie and 4 hours for this movie is justified. Hope Zack gets another opportunity at this JL. But one can only hope. Because of this hope only, we got to see this spectacle.\nThanks Zack....thanks WB for your patience", "Y'all fickle": "How is a longer version of the movie some fans hated even better? I'm not sure unless it's what I assume, ppl allowing the critics to sway their opinion.That being said, I liked this re-edit very much. It's pretty much the same movie with some scenes slightly different, an hour or so totally new content, and the action scenes had a lot of drama and emotion added to them.If I had one gripe it would be some of the cgi, but didn't bother me personally.Btw I'm neutral when it comes to all this dc vs marvel drama, I just want action and sci-fi, whether it's power rangers or Star Trek, all the same to me.", "Why this aspect ratio?": "Zack is the man for this job obv. But I don't understand why he shooted on this ratio in a wide screen world!?", "Exceptional": "This movie is redemption for everyone in that 2017 movie.", "Its Better For The Worse": "Zack Snyder's Justice League had fixed a lot of the MAJOR issues that were all over in Whedon's (2017), fixing it by actually being chronologically placed scenes, making it easier to follow, extended scenes, fixed messy dialogue.Stephhenwolf is an actually decent villain, as well as his CGI was fixed to make him look as intimidating as he was supposed to portray.The movie is 25 minutes of slow-motion, and I have never been a fan of Zack's color-grading for his films.It's decent but it certainly shouldn't have been four hours long.", "This looks like a documentary, not a movie.": "What can I really say, I wasted 4 hours of my life... Okay, it had some new information about everything, but 4 hours of it? And, repeating previous movies? Is this really a documentary? This looks like a drama movie, too. I have been giving a lot of 1/10 ratings, I should seriosly stop watching dumb movies... DC always makes dark movies, and by \"dark\" I mean that there is no sun nor light. The only light is Gal Gadot when she appears. Also, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa are the only reason I watched it. Definetly overrated movie by my opinion.I have to say something about the Mercedes that Ben Affleck and Ezra Miller drove off in. It does not look nice! Gal Gadot also drove a Mercedes, but that one looked nice. There is no sci-fi when it comes to cars. DC, take some example from Marvel, look how Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man) drives REAL cars. I could write a book on how bad I thing this \"movie\" is...Also, who tf is Zack Snyder? I mean, I know he's the producer or writer or whatever, but why is it necessary for his name to be in the title?", "Just one word EPIC..": "Finally im glad that i have seen the original version of zack of his Justice League and i just want to say that everyone has to watch that 4 hour long EPIC", "This is the true version that I waiting for...": "Zack Snyder's have such good reason for create The Snyderverse. I hope one day The Snyderverse will restore. I trust you Zack, I'm waiting more Films from you...", "I think DC exists to make Marvel look even better.": "What a shame. DC should just totally reboot the whole thing. The only reason I give it even 4 stars is the Nick Cave songs.", "Presented in 4.3": "What a waste, 4.3 is old and should never be used. What a complete disappointment. The extras are good, but come on 4 f'n 3, really. NEW TEXT HERE: here is the joke, my initial post was too short. Just like 4:3.", "Justice League 2&3 MUST happen!!!": "The plot did not change much from the 2017 movie. But although i've seen the same scenes again, to some extent, here they have a connection. This movie flows, the story wonderfully told, the plot far improved.What they did in 2017 was cut out all the emotion out of it, and leave us with a corpse of a movie. Nothing was worth seeing again. And now i cannot stop re-seeing scenes from this Masterpiece. It probably had some tiny issues, but i still give it a 10/10 because our wishes for it were heard.I hope Mr. Snyder, the God of DCEU, and the actors that returned to reshoot and finish this movie, read this: from all our hearts, thank you!", "Marginally better": "Only slightly better than the Whedon version in a way the suggests someone other than Snyder and Terrio read over the script before shooting began. That is to say, certain things get set up and paid off in the way a movie should act. Though Barry Allen is still insufferable and Gadot still can't act, the biggest improvements are Cyborg and Steppenwolf. They and other characters get backstories and motivations. That's good, but it's also the bare minimum any storyteller should be able to achieve. Snyder still can't control his own worst impulses. When he shows, he tells. When he tells, he tells again. When epic things happen, someone is there stating the obvious or a pointless narration accompanies it. As a result, it drags in many places and doesn't justify its runtime or its R-rating.There is still no room for subtly, and certain scenes still feel in places like they could have been edited around in any order ala BvS. Steppenwolf is now joined by DeSaad and Darkseid, but even with three baddies, Snyder still can't make a compelling villain with a reason beyond 'kill and conquer'. Did they all just forget for thousands of years they left the mother boxes on Earth? Some half-arsed line in the flashback waves it away.They also kept moving the finish line - for the first half of the movie, the mother boxes creating the Unity are the big ticking clock threat to be stopped. Then, just before the third box is found, this new threat of the 'anti-life equation' is introduced. Then the Unity is formed, but now we have time to stop them before they 'synchronize'. And the anti-life stuff is just kicked down the road. How do you feel the threat when the moment of absolute defeat keeps changing?And that epilogue...grrrr that epilogue...everything about it. The pacing, the bait-and-switch promise of new characters, the desperate setups that will never pay off...I haven't seen a final act handled so poorly since The Last Jedi.Thank goodness, though, Snyder kept some of my favorite schlocky moments, such as Diana's half-hearted \"Kal-el, no!\", and our heroes literally digging up Superman's grave and loading him into the back of a pedo van, so I got some entertainment. Well, bravo everyone. You willed a 4-hour mediocrity into bare-minimum existence. At least Snyder's vision is now done and we can move on.", "Surreal, but absolutely beautiful!": "At a loss for words with how this came out. It's truly extraordinary that it's a thing in the first place, but it's made all the more better by how well crafted Zack's film is. You can feel the love poured into this film and just how much it means to so many people. Incredible work Zack! I can only hope that this paves the way for more stories in the DC to be told by you.", "Restore The Snyder Verse!": "It is perfectly written and well executed. Zack Snyder's Justice League is epic masterpiece, it completely washes away old justice league. All character arks were great and subplots were well explored. Everything that happened was for some reason not like the old justice league.\nEagerly waiting for the justice league 2 and to see Darkseid in action.", "Perfect SuperHero movie": "I really enjoyed watching it. Still can't believe but I so thankful!\n4 hours of great storyline alongside great CGi, characters and atmosphere.\nWish Zack Snyder all the best and hope to see the continuation", "My Man!!!": "What do I have to add now that everything has been said.", "One of the best super hero movies ever made": "The film the fans deserved, epic and profound, the best DC movie ever made, and way better than anything marvel did, is absolutely ridiculous that warner did not follow that universe, lets hope that JL2 get a chance now.", "A considerable upgrade on the first try": "Oh boy, where to start? Towards the end of production on Zack Snyder's installment in the DC Extended Universe, Snyder's daughter Autumn took her life. Snyder departed the project for family, and Joss Whedon was hired to finish up. The result? A woefully misguided and messy Justice League movie, critically and commercially reviled. Then word of what Snyder intended surfaced, and the Internet kicked off the \"Release the Snyder Cut\" movement. Fandom is a dangerous thing to mess with, and the DC base are notoriously toxic. Warner Bros. was bombarded with calls and boycotters to allow Snyder to complete his vision. And what did we get in the end?Zack Snyder's Justice League is a significant improvement over the 2017 trainwreck, which, while not hard, was widely expected to be on par if not worse than its first hackjob. I'm not a fan of Snyder's work, and I've had just about my fill with this campaign, so I took part in a free advance screening a day early.The plot here is considerably more coherent with the action sequences and visual effects are what the first attempt's estimated $300 million budget should've covered. How we got the incomplete Cats-esque effects, I'll never understand, but while initially skeptical, I gradually became invested in the story I'd dismissed two and a half years ago.This cut is not without its flaws, most notably in acting ability, indecisiveness of what is and isn't worth keeping in, and attempts to inject humor among the band of dysfunctional heroes. A major criticism of the 2017 version was the humor, and I'm here to tell you that, as the Snyder Cut uses nothing by Whedon, the strives at comedy are Snyder's doing. Perhaps the only player worth praise is Gal Gadot, who seems to actually be trying compared to everyone else, who more than likely phoned it in.Overall, the Snyder Cut may be worth more to the folks who went out of their way to make innocent people's lives hell for a movie, but it's worth the checkout, even if you're not a hardcore DC fan. 7/10.", "Better than 2017 version": "OK movie. Better than 2017. Still MOS is best dceu movie in my opinion. WOuld love to see sequel of this", "This is the perfect Justice League!": "Here we see all the characters from Zack Snyder's vision. It's a really different point of view, and we haven't saw this ever before. This guy is a genious, and the movie is on-point.

It had a certain fake glow which was very weird and the whole scene screams green-screen room. A couple of other scenes had a similar look, like the one with Supes and his mom in the corn-field.\nJoker was still incredibly irritating and the whole epilogue scene was well confusing. (The whole old/young Lex Luthor and the Arkham Asylum thing)\nAll in all, pretty entertaining for a 4-hour movie.", "It's better": "It's better than the joss Whedon cut, that is for certain. Worth the hype", "Lengthy Watch.": "This is one of the very few movies that you really have to plan your time beforehand. You wouldn't want to pause it halfway just to go do something else and then continuing. It's what like 4 hours and you just gotta sit there and get it done.If you can handle the runtime, it's definitely worth it.It's a good time with world-ending problems, superheroes fight, superheroes die, superheroes fight again, stronger enemies, finding solutions, taking risks, etc. All were executed very well and with purpose.", "Where was this version all along....?": "The justice league movie released in 2017 is soo bad cared to zack syndders cut...this version of the movie keeps u interested in it ( I didn't notice 4 hours pass by :)..I recommend u guys watch the movie to feel the beauty/ heart/dedication put by the crew for the justice league movie...", "RESTORESNYDERVERSE": "After watching this , all I have to say is .\n#RESTORESNYDERVERSE", "The Real Story": "No spoilers, just commenting.

That's coming from a die hard DC fan. I am not a Snyder hater, but I simply thought it was an impossible dream. Now that I have seen it I am in literal chills. The film was everything I hoped Justice League would be and more. It is most definitely my favorite DC film. There are so many great moments and the story is great for each character. What we fans and cinema goers saw in 2017 was complete trash. I am glad to say that Zack Snyder's Justice League is an incredible journey that I hope to see continue. If you are looking for a reason to watch it, this is it. Go watch it!", "One of the best four hours you have ever spent": "As usual zack brings darkness in the movie he directed but the bright raises at the same time. One of the best 4 hours you would ever spend", "Awesome, Cinema needs to change": "Well in all honesty 4 hours is a lot of hours, but man this version of the movie is 10x times better than the so called original. Worth the watch and it made more sense for the Justice league universe.", "Snyder is a fan and made a movie for fans": "This could have been two movies following Dawn of Justice.

There was explanation to things that people who aren't comic readers, could follow.", "This must be continued": "Great movie in compare with other version.

Not perfect, but an amazing improvement over the theater version, THIS, should have been the one we watched back then, things would have been lots better. The only thing i didn't like?, the knightmare scene, the rest?... was EPIC, EPIC, EPIC.", "This is what the Original was meant to be": "My god, at first was I confused as to why I wasn't able to find the nice colored versions of the film, till I realized what it is. But man, is it an absolute joy to watch for those who grew up on watching Justice League and DC heroes on Cartoon network. This is what it was meant to be all along, especially fi they are to rival the extent to which the MCU has developed. They REALLY need to give Snyder complete freedom and let him direct the next few movies to really keep the character development and story arcs progressing and interconnected. He single handedly revived the DC unvierse witht this, they need to let him keep going and building. It'll be worth it for them, and for us, the fans.", "Better but More of the same": "While this version is at least watchable. There are still almost as many plot holes as there are unnecessary slow motion shots with sad music playing. The CGI is still subpar and Ezra Miller still doesn't k ow how to run. It was at least with the watch but no thanks to any more of this. Any movie is going to be better if the studio gives you four years, 70 million dollars and all the critics to make it better I'm sure any director can improve on what was done before.", "Best DC Movie Ever!": "This movie is leagues better than the other one, and that isn't even doing it a justice. Sure it might be long, but it is worth every second. The only chapter that wasn't as good was the first one, but it was still phenomenal. It was really exciting seeing all the new scenes that didn't make it to the Theatrical release. I think the best part of the movie was the Flash and Cyborg. They both had fantastic stories, that I won't spoil, but believe me, its really good. Honorable mention to Darkseid. The last scene with him was the coolest thing I ever saw. Definitely the best DC film I ever saw, and one of the greatest films overall I saw.", "More than what you expected. 10/10": "Zack you did it.. you did it. Thank you for this amazing experience", "EPIC! - Justice to Justice League": "Zack Snyder vision on DC universe was absolutely brilliant, the way he scripted the JL was epic. It feels like a whole new movie. ZSJL stands as a one of the best DC movie after wonder woman.

PLEASE KEEP IT COMING WE FINALLY HAVE \"ALL THE KINGS HORSE LS AND ALL THE KINGS MEN!\"", "Restored my faith in DC": "I love the MCU and have always been disappointed that DC hasn't been able to create a similar universe but this version of Justice League is exactly what DC needed. The characters were so much better developed and had greater powers. Wonder Woman had so many great fight scenes, the flash was a better character, and cyborg had a deeper story line and his powers were better displayed. I also loved the addition of some characters who weren't in the other version and it seemed to better open up the opportunity for sequels and more origin movies. Overall this version is fantastic!", "This film was made for me": "This is how I feel really.. that this film was made for me. Some people don't like the colors, I loved them. Not all films need to be a funfair of color. Some stories are more sombre and need to be shown in a different way.Some people though the music was out of place. It wasn't.. well except for the 'ancient music' that played every time Wonder Woman did anything.. that was a bit over the top and a bit out of place. It could have done with a longer section of her theme music at a different scene. Anyway only a minor issue with that.The aspect ratio wasn't my favourite but I got over it quickly. I would appreciate though a 16:9 version of the film to watch it again!A lot better written than I expected and although the Greek translations of Darkseid in the catacombs were laughable. I am Greek so the byzantine style letters that were used for Darkseid's mural were a bit.. weird let's say. All the characters were more fleshed out and there was an actual plot that made the sense and the final battle was fitting. Not like Whedon's childish plot.One thing worth mentioning is how laughable Whedon's version was. Makes me feel disgusted having to sit through that travesty now knowing that this was supposed to be released.I hope DC gives the green light for the sequels as they need to be made!ps. just a thought but this could have worked as a series.. split in 6 chapters/episodes.. just sayin' . Then again I'd happily sit through 4 hours of this again!", "Making something ordinary and expected into something extraordinary and unexpected": "Watching a film with known plot and ending is never too exciting. Snyder made this movie into a master piece. He proved the fans right. Demand of resorting snyderverse is totally justified after this movie. More attention should be paid to lighting and details in next movies of snyderverse.", "b i g improvement": "I wasn't a fan of the 2017 version of the film, had lots of issues with it. But with this version I was so invested. Even with the 4 hour runtime and the letterbox format, I wasn't bored by it at all. So many elements of the film made this version way better. The stakes are higher with much better written villans. In the last film I hated how they focused on one family and in this one they just take them out and now the consequences will affect the whole world. The screenplay was a huge improvement and was more serious and I guess appropriate in terms of jokes and confrontation between characters. The story was more engaging and intense. The characters were written much better and I cared about them a lot more because of the stakes that were on the line for each character. Character development was a massive improvement, lots more back story for characters without stand alone films like cyborg and flash, wasn't just a quick explanation as in the theatrical cut, we actually get decent flashback scenes with in depth development for these characters. The score was great but that Amazon music got to me after a while. The action was much better, thanks to the R rating allowing more gore which I enjoyed. The colours were a big improvement, looked more realistic with the colours being darker and not as bring and fake looking as the previous version. Most of the cgi was a big improvement, especially Henry's moustache heh, some choppy cgi in some action scenes but didn't affect the film overall. I would of loved to see this in the cinema for the big screen and sound experience, but it still looked and sounded great at home.", "Excellent \ud83d\ude3b": "Way better than Josstice League. #Restorethesynderverse", "Worth the wait!!": "This movie completely blew me away, forget the joss whedon version think really does the franchise justice!!", "Snyder won the hearts.": "It's definitely the Snyder's vision of the justice league. Everyone played their part so so good. Climax is mind-blowing. I expected more darkseid action but it's ok I'll see him in JL2. Thank you Snyder", "Real DC comic movie": "Its everything a DC movie should be. It captures the essence of the characters and Zack Snyder is a visionary and a masterpiece.", "What we should have had to begin with": "I'm astounded at how a masterpiece such as this was replaced with a subpar movie with infantile humour and horrible pacing. This movie had emotional depth and it felt very organic. I really hope the snyder verse is restored.", "Four hours and two minutes of genius": "Honestly, justice has been done to fix everything from 2017. From senseless garbage in Whedon's version to absolute storytelling genius in Snyder's.", "No much better than original": "Only marginally better than the original still tons of plot holes, but would it be a snyder film if it didnt. After being told certain characters would be in it was even more hyped yet nothing more than cameo only 30 sec clip of 1 green latern same with the gods. Martian on have less than a min darkseid was in yhe film less than joker pathetic . Didn't think the ending was any better than the original. Felt it dragged on with at least 1hr 30 of not needed and unnecessary footage. The soundtrack was awful and depressing. Overall didnt think it was worth the wait or the hype behind it Not much better than the original", "Zack Snyder's vision made real, with added improvement for fanfare.": "A fantastic improvement over Justice League 2017 and a delight to watch. My partner and I were enthralled by the character-building moments, great action scenes, and wonderful soundtrack. The entire time watching Zack Snyder's Justice League, I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a live-action version of the Justice League cartoon, but with even better storytelling.I highly recommend this \"Movie\"? (if you can call media that runs for 4 hours a movie) to any DC or general superhero fan. It offers a good change in tone from the generic marvel formula which is oversaturated in the current movie industry.Zack Snyder has just taken his seat as one of the greatest action-movie directors of our generation.", "Worth your Subscription and Time.": "The Snyder Cut was really amazing. It is better than the original Josstice League in every single way. The only knocks I have against this movie is too much slow-mo, and too much of Wonder Woman's theme. Everything else is amazing, this movie sets up these characters in a natural way, and never feels stuffed. Please watch this movie, it's just a near-perfect piece of art.", "Best Super Hero Movie of all times!": "I did not expect this at all, when I heard they are doing the Snyder Cut I thought to myself \"how can he make this hot mess any better\"\nWhat can I say after Justice League the awful Wonder Woman 84 the DC Universe is well alive, Henry Cavil is Superman, Wonder Woman works if it's directed by a grown up.... Thank you Zack Snyder for this amazing movie. Best Super Hero Movie of all times.", "Watched it again straight after": "Honestly was amazed by it, I literally gasped out loud at several scenes, luckily I watched it alone as that was embarrassing", "We need this": "Very nice !! Always enjoy watching this series. Been waiting so long for this, thank you for making this movie!! This really the movie we, Justice League fans deserve for, very nice plot and story and very detailed too !! This movie has touched me so emotionally and been so exciting to watch this.", "Better Than The Original In Every Way": "This is an epic film. Unlike the original the plot points are thought out and actually given time to develop without rushing to the next plot point. The character moments hit a lot more as well. They finally do The Flash and Cyborg justice without sidelining them which was one of my main criticisms of the original. In fact all the characters feel a lot more fleshed out. The villain gets abit more of a backstory, he's still not a great villain but we sort of understand why he is doing this. Now a lot of people are going to complain about the 4 hour runtime, I feel like the runtime is needed to help everything to be able to be fleshed out.Overall I'm going to give Zack Snyder's Justice League a 9/10.", "Hell to the YEEEEEESSSSSS!!!": "Zack Snyder, thank you! I mean it. Thanks for this. The whole cast and crew, for making this epic film experience possible, thank you. Everything I wanted and then some. Each member held their own. I truly hope we get more of this. It's just been set up so well now. I truly hope their is a future for this!!!! I can't wait to see it!!!!", "Snyder's Magnus Opus": "I really like Man Of Steel loved BVSue but I can still see it's faults but this movie totally blew me away.From the character arcs ,to the action to the motivation of the villains absolutely flawless.Only problems I have are Martian Manhunter is kinda tatch on last minute and Leto Joker is still insufferable but other then that this is the best DCEU movie so far.Warner Bros really botched the release of this movie that could of easly made a billion at the box office", "Emotional, funny and hardcore action. Everything for everyone.": "Really amazed by it. This movie have everything for everyone, emotions of a father/mother story for emotional people, Comic accuracy for nerds, hardcore action sequences which sets another level of bar for superhero movies.

It's the best superhero movie ever.", "something different": "This edition is so nice.. don't hesitate to watch it. Loved every minutes.", "Now this is Justice League!!!": "Superbly impressed with this one. This is a DC gem. Closest thing to Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones even. This was magical. For those fans who think WB has no vision is so short sighted and not logical. Yes they destroyed the 2017 version, but they have made great movies before, with this being one of them. Who knows why they did what they did, but they gave us this masterpiece, on HBO Max even (WB using their streaming service for good), so me and WB are even.", "My wife very happy": "Normally , every Super hero movies either MCU / DCEU, my wife always follow me to watch them all. Her review in first theatrical cut \" this movie so boring, there's a lot non sensical things\". i must agree with her. but after Synder version, her reaction was \"amazing\". this is the first time she always comment on everything like how Aquaman should be portrayed, how barry allen, even sympathized with Cyborg.There's so much justice to this version. i don't even feel i'm watching 4 hours movie. Now we need the sequel to this", "This movie is what DC needed.": "My title says it all really. Where do I start.\nThe music was sensational in my opinion\nExceptionally edited.\nI loved every single character story. With a deep connection with cyborg, Barry Allen.\nThe runtime was 4 hours long which personally I was not bothered by and I loved how how I was not bored and I was the opposite on the edge of my seat mostly always through the movie. Not gonna lie DarkSide did scare me. I just want to thank Zach for making this film because DC needed this the most. And hopefully we can see more of Ben Affleck and Henry cavill as superman. Also I think Shazam would be a very good addition to the next justice League movie. I loved seeing the Joker and batman together they had a really good connection and it tied things off really good. Can't wait to see what next is in store.A few of my pet peeves. But does not change my opinion about the movie.\nI would have loved to see a bit more of superman in this movie but that is just my opinion. But his story as Clark Kent was very good when he returned. Apart from that I don't have any more complaints. The CG was really good in my opinion especially for a redo that was edited. Steppenwolf and darkseid are not on the same level as thanos CG. but apart from that it's only going to get better as time moves on with the next justice League movie.Just have one more thing to say I know Robert pattinson is going to be the next batman but I really do like Ben Affleck now. I would like to see him in the next justice League or bat verse. Imagine that Robert pattinson and Ben Affleck.Thank you Zack SnyderIf there is any punctuation spelling mistakes I do apologise.", "This is what it should have been": "Well rounded and nicely paced for such a long movie. Makes much more sense than the theatrical release from the opening scene to the credits its a different film entirely and one not to be missed. The only downside is that it sets up an interesting future for the next films he wanted to make, which we won't get to see", "If this was the movie they ran with in 2015, MCU would be sweating!": "This recut caught me completely off-guard. No longer are we thrown into the plot halfway and expected to know who Flash and Cyborg are and what purpose they serve, where they came from, etc. We actually have backstory now. We even get backstory for steppenwolf! The recut was perfect except for one spot where Alfred is \"reintroduced\" to everyone on the team which seemed out of place, and I'm surprised they didn't catch it. Regardless, Snyder needs to be put back at the helm, and given creative control again so he can proceed with his original plans going forward. The slight nod to Tim Drake at the end with Joker gave me chills. Is he Tim Drake?! What we've essentially expected all along was the case since Suicide Squad?! Would be a killer storyarc. I really hope we don't let this fizzle here and die. Snyder did wonders with this recut and it deserves to be progressed.", "Justice League true redemption": "This movie was great from start to finish. A more cohesive story that gave every character a time to flourish. A movie that should have been released in theaters but overjoyed that this movie was still managed to be released.", "y": "As I get older. Now when faced with the 3 hours long, The Avengers: Endgame. All I can think is will no one think of my bladder.There are countless examples of even 2 hour long movies nowadays where I think the director could had easily sliced 30 minutes off.This brings me to Zack Snyder's Justice League. All 4 hours of it.I planned to watch this over several days and to my surprise I did it all in one day.Although Justice League (2017) has Zack Snyder credited as the director. The film was largely reshot by Joss Whedon who delivered the final cut at 2 hours. Snyder has not even seen the movie.Fan pressure got the Zack Snyder cut released. It looks like everything Snyder shot is in it, some with better special effects added and Snyder even shot some new footage.This is a more coherent version. I remembered just how rushed some of the scenes were in Justice League and the accompanying music by Danny Elfman.In essence Whedon's rewrite and reshoots created a monster with two competing visions. Which then had to be heavily edited for a shorter running time.Snyder has been allowed to give his cut room to breath. The main beneficiaries are The Flash and Cyborg who have more of a backstory and utilised better here.Ray Fisher who played Cyborg has been pretty critical about how his character's part was reduced in Justice League and how he disliked the atmosphere created by Whedon.Steppenwolf also fares better in this movie with improved CGI. In Justice League I thought he was just a generic CGI villain.There are still some downsides. In the opening hostage scene with Wonder Woman. She could had disarmed the baddie as we can see she moves very fast. Instead Wonder Woman lets him reload his gun, all so she can blast him from the side of a building. How many people did the falling debris injure?When The Flash is running around near the speed of light. Cyborg is just standing there doing nothing, not even looking behind him to check if Steppenwolf is there. In fact there is a bit too much standing around in several action scenes when the mother box is the most important item to protect.Superman is still the casualty in both versions. A reduced role for the Man of Steel who has to return from the dead.There is no doubt in my mind this is the better version of Justice League. However the real challenge would had been could Snyder had delivered this movie with 90 minutes shaved off.", "Compelling!!": "From the start you get this vibe of impending doom that will embrace the earth. This movie surely engrosses you in its story and keeps you in anticipation for the next act, without letting you notice the passage of time. Every character had some purpose and their interaction seem more organic, even the unintentional jokes seemed to hit right and didn't feel like forced in just for a gag. After this, I really wish to witness the Zack's universe of future installation that he had envisioned, I surely do.", "4:3!?, i really hate it": "I really loved to se more of the movie, but hated 4:3.\nIt felt like see a movie from the 80:s.\nBut so much better then first one \ud83d\ude03\u270c\ud83c\udffb", "exactly what you expect": "Is not often that a studio gives a green light to a director to create what is on his mind.One of the rare times that a film is a masterpiece of cinematography, and in the same time it explains everything to you.. everything. It is long but you only realise it either because you start getting hungry or it starts getting dark outside.The most fascinating thing, is that it made me wanting more..\ni was ready for more even after 4 hours.", "Epic masterpiece": "The Justice League movie I've wanted since I was a kid. Absolutely brilliant, start to finish. The storylines, genesis of the characters, the assemblance of the JL. The backstory of Uxas coming to Earth fighting the Atlantians, Amazons, humans. The arc of the Mother Boxes, to the resurrection of Superman, the brilliant trilogy is complete, now hopefully a JL 2 in the future.", "THIS MOVIE WAS A MASTERPIECE": "Everything about this movie was spectacular the the story for every character was good enough to know the character and the storyline was truly amazing.", "Snyder did this movie JUSTICE": "The reason I love this movie is the same reason I love Snyder. When I was a kid, I didn't read comics because I wanted to laugh and be silly, I read them as an escape. I was more of a Marvel kid and felt DC never went deep enough in the characters. I feel DC took a good turn with Batman back in the day, and the direction was changed. The Justice League was silly to me, and it felt more like comedy releif than a story. I watched the movie, but left UN-impressed.When I heard there was to be a Snyder release, I was not super optimistic, I felt not much could be done to enhance the story.BOY WAS I WRONG.The Snyder version took Justice League to a different level from the starting scene. Questions were answered, and I felt my intelligence was respected as a fan. I feel every necessary character was framed up and displayed to give a solid picture of who they were and why they were important. I felt the scenes, the cinematography, and entire feel was on point.Superman was the real deal, and suddenly Amy Adams role as Lois Lane blossomed into a serious journey. Even Alfred's role as Batman humble butler turned into a tolerance and protective scene.I love Gal Gadot, and if we saw the same Wonder Woman in every movie she played in as we did in the bank scene of this movie, I'd be an everlasting fan!!I feel the flaws of Superman was exploited to show he's not perfect, and that made me happy. Too much good and too much perfect makes for a boring comic book.Victor Stores character was suddenly so much more important as well, his life, his journey, his reason for being was emphasized clearly. Same with the flash, even though his character had a silly undertone, it was not distracting in Snyder's version.And thank you thank you thank you for bringing in the scene with Jared Leto as the Joker.... BRAVO!!I could go on and on about how pleased I was with this movie, but I'll leave it at this. Somehow, Snyder's cut left me wanting more after 4 hours that felt like only 2 hours.", "Didn't get anything wrong": "I'll keep it short and sweet. The original film that was released was somewhat of a joke, compared to what Zack had in store. It gives you a completely different perspective of the story and ignites the DC universe once again. It's a shame Warner Bros keep messing up the DC cinematic universe because THIS is how you should kick off the justice league. P.S if you like superhero films/action films the 4 hours doesn't feel like that, more like 3 and a 1/4 ;)", "No, it's not a good movie": "Dialogue sucks, character building sucks, story sucks. Very choppy, vague, not thorough. This is not for someone who hasnt read the comics. Bland. Felt like I was always waiting for the actual movie to start. Very disconnected from the audience. Disnt lead me into the universe at all. Actually couldn't have cared less about anything or anyone. So emotionless. Trying for doom and gloom \"reality\" and actually it's more unrealistically positive than marvel. Fan bois really want more of these movies?? I'll just stick to the classic DC movies I guess.", "Shallow, painful slow-mo and an awful soundtrackrack": "Aquaman constantly with his shirt off. Wonder woman and the amazonians in high heels makes it gross and shallow.The constant slow mo is also ridiculousThe acting is shockingDC just doesnt have an identity on screen and Zack is not the man for the job.", "Amazing! The version we all deserve. Thank you!": "I just have to say... This was amazing and thank you for releasing this so we can enjoy it. I didn't even feel like I was watching for 4 hours because I wasn't bored. Not even for 1 second. Loved it! Really enjoyed it! This reminded me of the animated Justice league movies. A lot of depth and showing everyone and how bada$s they all are. Every character adds their part to the team. That's what I love about DC. And that's what I love about the DC animated movies. This totally reminds me of that. And I'll for sure be watching this over a couple times. Thank you!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "Finally matches the previous movies": "I loved this version and was not happy at the 3 hour mark that there was only one hour left. This version matches up with the things which were set up in the previous movies. The core story hasn't changed but the characters are more fleshed out, especially Cyborg. The fact that it ends on a cliffhanger which sets up the next film is frustrating because we may never get to see it. I love the nightmare future and would love to see a feature length film set in it.The only thing that I would point out that bad CGI and cheesey jokes aside I don't see how Zack Snyder could have made a cinema releasable cut any different from the one that Joss Whedon put out. The studio would have put the same pressure on Snyder as they obviously did on Whedon to keep the runtime down. If you had to cut this movie in half to 2 hours a lot of what made this great would have been lost and the result would have been similar to the original cut we got.", "Best experience": "Snyder Cut is the real amazing 'theatre' experience with 7 parts and Epilogue. Unique vision in comic book movies. Wow! 4 hours is fly fast.", "DC and Warner are crazy.": "So basically they had a masterpiece of a movie, wonderfully written, shot and even plotted in a way that sets the ground for a highly successful franchise of movies, but they decided to cut it themselves, make a complete mockery of the source material and kill a multi billion franchise.\nOnly because \"4 hours are too long\".\nWhy not release it in 2 two hour long movies then?\nAfter watching the Snyder cut, one cannot help but think how bright the DC Universe seems.\nBut no, they had to destroy it, remove all the key elements of the original story, and with it any chance to see a sequel concerning Darkseid.\nWhat a shame. Nevertheless, we finally have a wonderful DC movie. One that we have not had so far.\nWonder Woman and Aquaman were good films, but this is a different kind of beast.\nAnd Kudos to mr Snyder.\nUnlike everyone else involved in the making of the Justice League, he delivered.", "Now we restore the Snyderverse as canon!": "Truly masterful. Adding/leaving in important, emotional scenes and changing some of the off-point dialogue truly makes this movie a masterpiece! Hats of to all the great actors and the man Zack Snyder himself. Gives literal goosebumps and the 4 hour run feels natural and major plot holes are fixed that came with the 2017 version.", "Overall an upgrade!": "The last one felt like it was just going through the emotions this made me feel them. Some movie mistakes here and there but overall the movie we deserved. One bad thing and that was Amber Heard, I can't wait to see the next one, if she's not in it that is. Loved all the connections we got to the other movies as well as the TV shows.", "Worth every minute": "This movie is worth watching... every single minute of its 4 hours. A lot of meaningful moments and funny without the need to be. It balances the different charachters almost perfectly. Lost faith in DC by watching the first one, but faith is restored.", "Emotional rollercoaster!": "What started as a movement from fans to show there support to Zack, this has been an emotional journey, from the updates and stories, to finally seeing the movie tonight, it is incredible and we support the possible for Zack to return for a sequel!", "A GREAT MOVIE. NEED A SEQUEL": "WHY DID WE NOT GET THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE??!!\nIT IS EPIC!Story - Although at it's core it's the same story as the 2017 version. The way is presented is a treat to watch. Snyder is blending mythology with superhero stories (like the fight in Chapter 2). There is a strong backstory for Cyborg. The Flash is a fleshed out character. The villain is not a bore. And it's not some \"dark\" movie where superheroes team up, crack jokes out of nowhere and fight the guy and done like the 2017 version. You root for the heroes. The right balance.Visuals - The cinematography is stellar, consistent tone. NO RED SKIES. VFX at places are amazing (Steppenwolf) given the team did this in such a short time during the pandemic. Some places it's a bit off. Also the aspect ratio, which I personally did not have a problem with. And you get the usual Snyder-esque shots and then some.Music - One of the strongest achievements, Junkie XL much like Snyder's style of blending elements does an amazing job with the soundtrack. Mixing the electronic and cinematic classical elements creating an EPIC soundtrack. Especially the Flash sequence in Chapter 6.Now I get a lot of people will have problem with the aspect ratio and the runtime. But personally I enjoyed every minute of it. Could've been shorter but there's room to breathe and slow down before the film goes all guns blazing by the end.\nUltimately this is a vastly superior cut and a well made movie. Respect to Chris, Will and Zack. You can see Snyder poured his heart and soul into bringing this to life, and it is one of his best works till date. Needs a sequel.\nAlso want more of Deathstroke (looking at you - cancelled Gareth Evans movie).Fans have made this movie possible. They enjoyed it, I enjoyed it.\nYou do you.", "Best upgrade ever!": "I loved every minute of it!!! The flow of the movie was great. Really hope we can get Part 2 and 3!", "Good, but..": "Why take out some of the best lines? \"do you bleed\" by supes to bats. bats says \"the world needs you to superman\" and supe replies, but do they need you?the strength difference between characters were off. wonder woman can kind of fight both supes and stephanwolf, but supes absolutely destroyed stephanwolf? so shouldn't supes destroy wonder woman too when they fought?why did they make darkseid look so weak in the first battle? darkseid is like a living god and can beat superman in a fight. darkseid was pretty easily defeated by an axe, arrows and lightning? also why did they let darkseid easily get away, when they could of killed him?also the epilogue didn't make sense, cuz in that world, it looks like injustice, joker tricked and drugged supe into killing a pregnant lois and supes went mad and killed joker and then ruled the world. why was joker still alive? why would anyone change that story line? and even if joker is alive, why would bats use joker? what possible use would joker be in that world?", "Zack Snyder's redemption": "I don't understand how WB could cut this film and launch the disaster they did in 2017. Restore the snyderverse is essential now since the movie provided with so many spin offs and sequel potentials. Deathstroke, martian man hunter and joker were epic and for my cyborg and flash stole the show for me. Please let Zack continue his vision and then we all can see what happens after the ending of this movie. The knightmare sequel has so much potential. Let him do what he does best. Let the snyderverse continue.", "Fans weren't wrong !!": "Zack Snyders Justice League ReviewBest DC film to date Best Snyder film to dateAfter all the denial, leaks, bad media reviews; finally the finished Snyder Cut is available to the common man.What started with a tregedy (Director Zack's daughters passing), after all these years has ended with a wonderful experience.After seeing it i think that this was the right time & place where something of this magnitude could happen. Even if Zack was allowed to make this way back. it would've been still ended up as a cut-up mess.Like a coin that has two sides where Marvel uses PG 13, light banter undertones, DC has been always dark, brooding & \"Serious\"\nThis time also things are indeed serious but after seeing it you will understand that having two things of varying contrasts is better for us the viewers.The film is a complete breath of fresh air & with its color palette offers a new dynamic to any comic movie, be it Marvel or DC.There is finally decent representation of each of JL members & if you want to get a taste of what can happen if an artist is given free reign just compare the Wonder Woman bank robbery scene between this & the Whedon cut. Its unrecognisable, brutal & badASS.Cyborg is no longer a nobody but is pretty much the mantle piece here. Flash has more to do & so does Aquaman who shows he can be a team player when needed. WW & Batman takes reigns as experienced fighters leading the team as well as Superman even though late comes in banging.Oh & then there's JOKER. Even though he was ridiculed for the potrayal of the clown prince of crime, Jared Leto comes back in a big big way. Even though his performance was small, it was excellent & up there with the greats. Gotta see it to feel it.The 4Hrs whizzed past in no time & the epilogue part of the movie clearly denotes to a part 2 or an intended part 2 which would be great if it can happen but alas the cry of fans wasn't invain. This is a great comic book movie, movie period.Zack who was undoubtebly balancing many things both in his personal as well as professional life has come through with something that will paint you with a smile.Definitely heavens better than Whedon's cut & make no mistake this is not the same movie, its pretty much a NEW FILM.

They did things in a specific way and that's great, but many movie goers want something different. Something with cinematic, dark, grounded material. D.C. Comics has many characters viewed as some of the most World wide known and have villains that can't compare to any other. This is a universe of storytelling and vision people like myself want and need. WB would be making a mistake to copy and paste. Be bold, be dark, be unique and let the directors (Zach Snider ;), put there vision out there for true fans of the comic style movie put to screen. Every character has better story telling, better connection, more purpose, and action is off the chain! This is the shortest 4 hours I've spend on a movie. The theatrical release is half as long but feels like it moves slower. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an epic exercise in genre film-making.": "Essential viewing for anyone interested in the \"comic book\" genre of films that seemingly have been taking over the cinema in recent years. This isn't the Disney-esque take on superheroes that the previous movie tried to be. Yes, it is dark, there is a touch of humor but the film can also initiate a bit of self-reflection. Zack Snyder's Justice League is an epic exercise in genre film-making. ZSJL is broken up into different acts or chapters to provide the viewer with breaks during the 4hr runtime. I actually only used one of those breaks midway through the film and the time, surprisingly, flew by, which is a good indication of effective storytelling. This is the version Warner Bros. should have released in theaters in 2017, then the DC Extended Universe, could have continued with cohesiveness instead of the aimless, meandering direction fans of DC have suffered through since. Snyder managed to do what Marvel did in one 4 hr long opus, as he established the characters and fully fleshed out their motivations in one movie, instead of several. This time around, Cyborg and Flash aren't mere sidekicks to the DC trinity of Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, but the heart and soul, and key components to the success of the team's mission. We can fully appreciate Cyborg's anguish with losing his mother and his own life, only to be brought back as some Frankensteinesque monster by a seemingly absent father, all in the name of scientific discovery and experimentation. He hates himself and his loss is felt by the viewer, so his rebirth in later acts is something of a triumph. We also get to know Steppenwolf's motivation, it's clearly spelled out for us in the course of the narrative, and Darkseid being behind the scenes is acknowledged as the larger threat to planet earth. In short, the time invested in learning about these characters, their struggles and motivation, is time well spent and it breathes life into their reason for being, and unlike the 2017 theatrical release, the viewer really starts to care for, and root for these characters. Now, this isn't by any stretch a perfect film, there is a bit of self-indulgence by Snyder that really could have been left on the cutting room floor, like the villagers serenading Aquaman as he swims off and the woman who sniffs his discarded clothing. It is, however, a respectful homage to DC characters, a great example of how comic-based movies can be more than brainless action sequences strung together with dialogue in between only meant to move the story along, as well as a nod to classic cinema. Plenty to like about this film and enough that it should wipe away the painful memory that is the Justice League 2017 flick. Warner should really consider removing the 2017 version from distribution and sticking it in a dark vault somewhere on Apokolips.", "Best movie in the world": "I have never seen a movie so complex and well planned and thought out like this.. If movies keep being made like this all my money will be spent and I'll be living off the hope of Zack making another movie #greatmovie #snyderverse", "Perfect!": "Perfect and beautiful, this film is a masterpiece, his universe must be continued.", "The best comic book movie since the Watchmen": "This movie is amazing! Even though it's a director's cut, so almost 4 hours long, you immediately lose track of time and get sucked into the story. And as a typical Zack Snyder movie - the story telling is on the highest level. The different arcs are built slowly with attention to detail and it all falls into perfect place.\nI never liked the New 52's focus on Darkseid, but the way Snyder tells the story, really makes you want more and see the conclusion. I also love Ben Affleck's approach to Batman, which is very similar to the character from the Animated Series. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is the best incarnation of the character ever and Ray Fisher's Cyborg is the first time I get to like the character at all.\nBut the story telling wouldn''t be complete without the visuals, which are breath taking. The slow motion sequences are perfect for a comic book movie, many of the scenes are live action comicbook scenes and I don't know any other director, who would be able to create such amazing shots. This movie is a feast for every comic fan.", "For Jack and his Justice": "I give it 10 of 10 for is future that's on the verge.This vision deserves to be continued.", "It's an OK movie but no where near close the current rating": "The movie is a little bit better than the original but it's not really worth stretching the story for 4 hours when there is no real character development in the first place. Showing a guy playing football and another guy saving a girl isn't character development. If you have 2 more hours you could have easily made more scenes about The Flash or that Cyborg guy, but the actor of that Cyborg guy has no personality anyway. So it would have been pointless anyway.Actually, if you want to save some time you could just watch the last 20 minutes of the movie which are more interesting than the whole movie. I don't understand the ratings for this. It's ok but I'm quiet sure no one will watch this movie a 2nd time because there is just nothing special about it.It could have been cut to 3 hours. There are so many unnecessary scenes like Diana telling the girl she can become anything she wants. She can't. She wasn't born with super powers. It's just the usual political stuff. Superheros telling kids they can become whatever they want is 50s story writing. It's boring and shouldn't have a place in movies nowadays.And yeah, the CGI in the ending (Flash + Cyborg guy) is just terrible. If you slow it down it looks like late 90s CGI. Overall the CGI looks very artificial. All the materials in the universe don't feel natural. Maybe it's because of the lighting. Everything made of metall looks weird.", "Best one from Zack Snyder!": "I can't believe Joss Whedon ruined such a masterpiece for us. This is the best movie given to us by Zack Snyder. So much richness in Story, importance to every character, much more refreshing and more importantly they fight Steppenwolf as a team, not just Superman finishing off Steppenwolf.\nThis is an absolute delight.\nA MUST WATCH!!!", "For Autumn! Beautiful masterpiece by Zack Snyder in honor of his daughter! So wholesome, satisfying, and beautiful": "Although it is 4 hours long, it's a beautiful and wonderful film by Zack Snyder that does not actually feel like 4 hours-actually goes by quickly. This was a million times better than the original release of justice league. I am so happy and proud that Zack Snyder got to create his true vision of the film to create this masterpiece. The film is full of emotion to create powerful memorable moments. There are some scenes in the film that are now some of the best scenes in the DCEU due to how well it was made. The tone and style are a lot more mature and it feels like some other Snyder films like \"Watchmen. The cinematography and effects were beautiful to see. Of course Snyder's camera work was phenomenal as it always was. And the addition of new scenes and dialogue was an amazing choice as it provided excellent moments and more clarity while making the audience pleased. Overall I think this was an amazing, phenomenal, and creative masterpiece that showed how the film was intended to be with many elements of beauty, emotion, and with the intention to be a powerful and memorable film. Also may I point out that Snyder did not take any cut on this film because he just wanted to create the best film possible to complete his vision for his fans and for Autumn. His beloved daughter, Autumn, would be proud of you Zack. May she Rest In Peace!", "Loved this version": "Loved this version explained everything. Please do another", "An epic story that finally delivers the Justice League fans fought so hard for": "This movie was everything we expected, and more!! it was the triumph that we were robbed of back in 2017, but now it's finally here. Everything is better in what many including myself will now see as the definitive version of Justice League, no matter what WB says. Cyborg is now a character, Flash is no longer a quip machine, and Steppenwolf is finally the bad ass conqueror we were supposed to see originally, I even sympathized with him at times when he talked with a certain Apokolips character throughout the film. Yes the movie is very long, but here that's not necessarily a bad thing, if you could get through Lord of The Rings then you can get through Zack Snyder's Justice League. To sum everything up I would say watch this film if your a DC fan, destroy your Justice League memories and replace them with Zack Snyder's Justice League, you will fell much better afterwards I assure you.", "I'll be nice": "A long 4 hour movie desperately attempting to make sense. A lot of build up to be left disappointed and confused. DC can't keep up with Marvel and this is obvious.P. S. Zack Snyder please give up on the Joker, didn't you listen to the criticism? Yes we get it you still think Leto didn't ruin a beloved villan. Thanks for the reminder.", "Better than the Theatrical Cut, but not incredible": "The Theatrical Cut of Justice League was a boring mess and I'm happy that this movie managed to filter out most of the garbage writing and scenes in the Theatrical Cut. Although the 4 hour length is too long it really benefits from having the 2 extra hours to create a coherent universe that sets up lots of exciting things (too bad it's not canon).\nThe main improvement in this version is the character development. Cyborg was more like a side character in the Whedon cut but Snyder managed to give the character more depth which made him one of the greatest parts of the movie. The flash was also improved as I don't like his character. I found him obnoxious and unnaturally awkward and in the Snyder Cut there was less of his badly written joke so it's sorta positive. Even Steppenwolf got turned from a clich\u00e9 destructive villain to a good antagonist with a clear purpose, he wasn't great but good enough for what I expect from a superhero action movie.\nThe action sequences were also improved, the gory scenes were a nice addition to the film and the whole third act was completely different and actually good. There was no stupid Russian family no one cares about, so that makes it soo much better but the lighting, shots and action was really nice in the end.Now time for the bad things about the movie. A big problem is the CGI, like the Theatrical cut It was sorely lacking compared to modern standards. To me the only thing that improved was Steppenwolf's design which I liked, mainly the armour. Besides this everything else was the same like Cyborg who still looked so fake. Other than CGI there was lots of boring, unnecessary scenes that really could have been taken out to shorten the massive length. There was too much focus on Lois Lane and other boring things when I would rather see more Batman or Aquaman, who didn't have enough screen time.Overall this is a solid superhero action movie and anyone who's really into comics or their movies will love this movie. It has its fault but I was never expecting this to be a masterpiece, I think it lived up to my expectations. Its definitely worth a watch if you have 4 hours to spare.", "Best JL Saga movie ever": "This feels like a proper Justice League movie. The movie is 4 hours long but the time and effort given to build each character was really great to watch and relate.Thank you Zack and all those people who supported the crew to bring back the original, meant to be JL saga.", "amazing": "Amazing movie i really enjoyed it . i hope they make a sequel", "This should have been the original release": "Took awhile to get here, but worth it. At no point did it seem like a four hour movie. Aspect was a drag, but I can understand it was filmed for IMAX. Now I only hope Snyder is allowed to do the remaining movies. Need to see what happens next.", "Hated to hear my Heros using the F word": "Could have done without the vulgar language. But it was a much better movie than the first. I loved the Flash and Wonder Woman and Cyborg was more likeable to me. Batman was still an antihero to me.", "A True Masterpiece.": "Today, we can only imagine how things could have been different if this movie was released instead of Joss Whedon's one. This version has much depth in the story, so much promised to the characters identity & the all build up throughout the movie is mind-blowing. Even though, the movie might be a little bit large but it is all worth the time.", "You won't feel this 4 hour journey.": "I don't usually write reviews but this should be said. From the beginning, the movie looks like an Art and the music enhances everything. There were no jokes but not cringy as the last version. The colour palette is balanced and natural. The final battle is longer and better than the last version, in fact all the action scenes are like that. There was more character development and emotional scenes. Overall everything is amazing. It would be a disrespect to even compare this to the 2017 version.", "Better than the theatrical release": "Ok it was definitely waaaay more enjoyable than the theatrical release, however I think the casting of Ezra Millar was an absolute disaster. He is creepy and the worst Flash that has ever graced the screen. The scene of him just staring at Diana was asbolutely ridiculous, and he's entire character makes him seem like he's high on the spectrum.Over and beyond his terrible acting, there are clear plot holes, that aren't satisfactorily explained, and a myriad of other poor script writing faux pas that emerge.I think DCEU need to take page out of the animated movies, as the scripts are tighter and characters are definitely more interesting.", "SNYDERS VISION IS AMAZING!!!": "I'm so happy he was able to fulfill his vision for this film. I love this character's and the Snyder Cut finally treats them with respect.", "That worked for me.": "It was a great way to spend a day off from work while it was raining. Did Zach do too much with the slow-motion action scenes like he did with 300? Yes. Did he have women singing to signify significant points and/or slo-mo drama? Yes. I DON'T CARE. It was better than the original, which didn't hate by the way. This fleshing out of certain characters and ideas/aspects of the movie was good. Don't listen to the hype Zach \"stans\", but don't listen to the haters either. It wasn't a 10 out of 10, but I gave it such because some men like to watch the world burn, and I am one of those men.", "Something special only dc fans will know": "Greatest comic book movie of all time. Made for comic book lovers and real superhero heads not like \"popular action comedies \" so get alert . pure chef dish", "Now we demand Snyderves": "You know it's a real deal when you bite your lower lip while watching the film. Barry Allen is back on the track and Cyborg is truly the heart of this movie. It's so satisfying to see Wondie fight fiercely unlike what we have seen from W84.\nWe neeed more of this!", "Hands down 110% better than the theatrical version.": "The movie is better than the theatrical version. 4 hours passed by easily due to the great pacing of the movie. The climax will leave you shocked.", "An improvement by leaps and bounds": "This movie is so much better in so many ways, the story actually flows and the character development is there and you care about the characters. Here's hoping they let Zach make another.", "Worth it!": "The effort Zack put in realising his vision shows! Badass characters, scenes that give you literal goosebumps, perfect for the real DC fans.\nThank you Zack. #snydercut", "I have hopes now for future Dc cinematic universe \"A truce, Bruce\"": "This is a movie was made thanks to persistencies of the fans of superheroes especially Dc fans will love this movie. Zack Snyder's Justice league is a 4 hours movie but it uses this long runtime to its advantage, with this long runtime we can consider it as a kind of mini-series. First of all Snyder's dark tone fits Dc cinematic Universe, this movie proves it again, as we know from 2017 version, the movie wanted become another Avengers movie thanks to Josh Whedon, it didn't work and it will never work because Dc doesn't have to copy Marvel cinematic universe. Dc has a lot of original content to create its own universe without applying a kind of imitation. Snyder's Justice easily surpasses 2017 version in terms of character developments. Moreover, we saw Aquaman movie too. In Snyder's Justice league Cyborg character gains the most profit in terms of character development because his screen time increased pointedly in compare to 2017 version .Even, Flash character benefits in this version even so he needs a movie of his own. Although CGI mostly the same Steppenwolf CGI was improved and addition of Darkseid is important to tell more coherent story. I loved Joker cameo, we could see the Leto's real potential in this movie at last. Epilogue part made me wanting to watch more Justice league so my hopes about Dc cinematic universe return again but still I am cautious for the future. Now lets move on, the things that I didn't like with movie. I think however story reached more acceptable form, it is still a mess. I have always think that notion of death should be used in more serious way. If a character dies and we see him/her is dead and it should stay that way or it sabotages movies' coherence in terms of realism. As I mentioned before Barry Allen definitely needs an origin story. Amazon song which plays in wonder woman scenes was very ridiculous and it distracted my attention in Wonder Woman scenes , Wonder Woman's theme music is more than enough so it should be used in her scenes. One of the biggest issues with Dc cinematic universe is that is too complex and it gives confusion to its audience. I still have this confusion because new movies are reshooting again with different actors and it is ridiculous also, there are 2 two jokers, 2 Batman and if things come out way, they can connect every character to each other so I don't like this kind of uncertainties. I hope we don't different Jokers in the same universe or the different Batmans. Briefly, It is a decent attempt but it is still close to a mess movie, Although it fixed so much things when we compare it to 2017 version. It is still not enough to compete with Marvel. On the hand, Epilogue part pledges more for future and I'm looking forward to this.Since 2017 version was very bad, I had very low expectations from this movie in the end I'm happy with this version because I got more than that I had ever expected.Superhero movie lovers shouldn't miss this movie.", "The Hype Was Real": "This movie is a beautiful masterpiece of what we intended to get years ago. With a spectacle of Junkie XL's score as well as the shots that Snyder put together was a great culmination of cinema. Seeing Steppenwolf's recreation as well as seeing his motive for the reason why he was on earth. Overall, great to see all the new characters that were able to shine and seeing the story make much more sense with all the filling in.", "Worst movie ever!!!": "I hope WB never accept this trash as a cannon, and snyder should never return he could have ruined DC universe.", "Zack Snyder justice league is just a epic superhero movie in the entire DCEU": "Well we should be thankful to zack Snyder that he has finally delivered a movie for fans which was supposed to get release in 2017 unfortunately zack Snyder personal tragedy nd studio interference led to sabotage of his vision.\nThis version of Zack Snyder justice league proves that theatrical cut of justice league is dead.\nWarner bros can't hide this truth by saying Justice League 2017 is canon for them believe me this can't save ur asses in the coming future.", "It's better...but not good.": "Omg this was sooo long and boring. I thought 4 hours cool. How often does a 2hr movie end and you wish it were longer? All the time right!? Well this is one that at 2 hours I was wanting the last hour back. I kept watching in hopes it would turn around. Everyone was \"so excited\" to see Snyder's cut I think they forgot that he also made Batman V Superman and regardless of the cut it was garbage and this just proved its not the studios interference that makes his DCEU movies unwatchable. Nope he does it all on his own. The only highlight and positive critique I can give this four hour root canal is that cyborg was made into a fully drawn out character rather than a plot devise used to speed up the story telling in the first version. I'm so glad the DCEU is being rebooted cause their work so far has been subpar which considering the source material it's almost criminal what's been put out and considering the DCEU has all of its film rights at one studio theirs literal zero reason it's been this bad aside from WB not willing to put in the time and effort to be what they could be, which is as big and likely even bigger than the MCU. So it's fitting that WB AT&T are one in the same since they are both known for taking money and providing sub par service and Justice League Snyder cut fits right in. Long as heck and doesn't even give you satisfaction or enjoyment for your time. This director should fade into the shadows like the man who attempted to complete it for WB the first time.", "THANK YOU ZACK": "A dream came true..from the animated justice league to this..thank you Zack and everyone involved!!for Autumn", "THIS WAS THE FILM THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!": "In every sense of the word and expression, I agree 100% with most of my compadres. THIS VERSION \"TRULY\" ROCKED!!!I enjoyed all 4 plus hours of this WORK-OF-ART. In all honesty, I've been following Zach Snyder's work since his SPECTACULAR re-make of George Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead in 2004. I am SO-GLAD that the studio finally gave Zach his \"PROPER\" due, and released this version that we've all knew was THE GENUINE ARTICLE! As far as Whedon is concerned; DON'T SEND A \"BOY\" 2 DO A \"MAN'S\" JOB! Zach Snyder is \"The Man\" for this franchise! FULL STOP!!!!!I also believe that this should usher-in a NEW BIRTH (so-to-speak) of the franchise with all the major principle characters and ORIGINAL ACTORS returning to play their respective roles (Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill and others).I also LOVED Jared Leto's JOKER! As far as Robert Pattinson (Batman) is concerned, PLEASE GUY-OUT HIS CONTRACT, AND SEND HIM ON-HIS-WAY! Ben Affleck is my Batman of choice!", "ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE. WHAT A DIRECTOR'S CUT NEEDS TO BE.": "I wasn't expecting much of this new revision, as, in general, I think most of director's cuts don't add up too much to the original released film.This is not the case, quite the opposite, for me this is a brilliant example of how director's vision really matters. And editing proves itself as the most valuable tool to put things into the right place. Believe me when I say that this is a different movie from the chaotic version we were delivered originally at the cinemas in 2017.Four hours and two minutes, that's what this new cut needs to get things right. A remastered soundtrack, which smartly gives the right tone/tune to every moment of the film; a new colour treatment, that keeps the darkness, but also clear everything up, to let us see and enjoy the plot as it had to be done the first time.The new edition leaves the story breath, giving us pieces we need to understand the background of every character. The Flash or Cyborg appear here like much more solid characters than the incoherent presentation we were given in 2017's Justice League.I still miss Christopher Reeve when I see Henry Cavill playing Superman, and I feel the same if I compare Ben Affleck with Christian Bale. But in the end, this movie leaves a very nice taste for me, of what a DC Comics Justice League film deserves, an epic experience, where every minute is worth watching.", "DC is back, please don't SCREW it up": "First off don't listen to people who wrote a review 15 min into the movie, their thoughts are useless.I would put this movie up against any Marvel movie and really enjoy the MCU.It's about time DC finally created some character development for their upcoming movies (besides Wonder Woman 1984, sorry that was just a bad movie all together, unfortunately it came after this release).It did however create a great beginning to a Flash and a Cyborg movie whenever they come out as long as they use the character development from this movie and not the Joss Whedon version.Don't get me wrong I didn't completely dislike the Joss Whedon version but this movie just adds a lot more to the characters.I'll break it to pro's and con's of the moviePro's:\nWay better character developmentIntroduction of important characters to the DCEUBetter Steppenwolf designDark (the way DC should be)Its roughly the same story but changed a lot on how the characters get there (spoiler the hero's win)Music was greatBetter action scenesTied together betterCon's:\nPoor CGI at timesLong run time ( but needed to develop characters better)Dialogue could have been better at timesAll in all it's a very good movie and it's just what the DCEU needed as long as they don't screw it up from here.", "What I've wanted since 2017. :,)": "Grateful to witness Snyder's true vision, I can only hope for more.", "well done Zack Snyder!": "If Your wife enjoys a 4 hour movie that must mean something! I'm rather into superhero movies and enjoy them a lot. My wife not so much, but she still tries to keep up. We both enjoyed Averngers Ifninity War but came out a bit disappointed after the Endgame. Here however, Zack Snyder did a really good job. There are not many cliches, and stupidity. The movie feels like a whole, and first time I checked what time it was when we were 2,5 hour into the movie. Ben Afflecks approach to older Batman is something thats gonna be missed. Bats does act like this pure human component putting together a bunch of meta-people that he can do things he couldnt. And for one second he doesnt try to be superhuman while hes at it. This approach to ones limits goes for every hero out there and its different than what we ve seen in Endgame.", "Never Die Hope": "After the passing of Superman (Henry Cavill), Earth is hailed as helpless against assault from outsider powers. That incorporates New God Darkseid (Ray Porter) and his messenger Steppenwolf (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), who need to get their hands on three planet-obliterating 'Mother Boxes' that were covered up away on our planet some time in the past. It's dependent upon Batman (Ben Affleck) to amass a group of saints with uncommon capacities to make all the difference.", "This movie saved my faith in the DCEU!": "Zack Snyder's vision for the future of this franchise is brilliant. His story without Joss Whedon's terrible direction makes for a fantastic film. The runtime went by faster than I realized, and is really of no issue to me. The climax was superb, and the ending to this movie is amazing. I could not believe how amazing this movie truly was and it deserves all the praise fans are giving it and more. Zack Snyder's Justice League not only does justice (no pun intended) to the entire franchise, but also keeps what this franchise had that was great in the first place. I will be excited to see what movies are coming next, hungry for more!!!", "Warner bros needs to give a green light for part 2": "It would be tragic if they dont give everything to Zack to fulfill his vision....i saw the movie 2 times already...its a masterpiece...", "Absolutely Overwhelm 2017 Version": "You know what, WB sucks. Just let the right man and actors and group do their jobs, and don't ever send jesters into professional team.", "this is a proof that acting is not enough, either do it right, or go home.": "Bold movies with 4 hours runtime are not very popular nowadays, but looking at this masterpiece, building so many characters will definitely take time that is very much deserved, going back to justice league (2017) you get 0 idea who the hell are Cyborg and the flash, building up the momentum was worth it, some very big titles had +4 hours movies, they weren't shy about it however, I hope these guys learned the lesson now, do it right, or go home.", "Restore The Snyderverse!": "After watching this film like 3x already, I realized that this movie is a true masterpiece! Even though I am a huge Marvel fan I have to give credit to both Zack Snyder and DC for allowing him to finally finish his vision of the DC universe. I am beyond amazed and excited to see more sequel in continuation to this movie. This is just the beginning of the DC multiverse. So here is my message to you WB, you need to get your act together and start listening to your fans, because if you don't you will never get a successful film movie when you have Zack around. Stop trying to copy what Marvel does and start letting someone like Zack do his thing and help you by making more movies in continuation of his vision of the DC multiverse.

Enough said.", "Its a masterpiece": "#RestoreTheSnyderVerse. #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague.thats it the movie is finally here watch it on hbo max or whatever it is available everything is incredibly good in the movie", "Finally the justice league we all deserve": "Super enticing! It is one of the best scripts about the superhero topic that I have ever seen. So amazing, dramatic, and full of various emotions. Thank you zack synder for this amazing film. I wish we get to see the synderverse in future.", "Not perfect, but SO MUCH BETTER": "If you compare it to the original, yes its miles better. There are actual backstories and character developments in this movie. The story makes a lot more sense, and it doesn't feel forced. But I think we shouldn't just judge this movie based on the original. In that case, it's a bloody masterpiece, but that's a little to easy. There are still problems that did not get fixed. The story still has a very big villain issue. Steppenwolf gets a lot more backstory and emotions, but we still don't really know why he's doing this. It still feels like we are watching a bad guy trying to become powerful because he wants more power. Yes, he tries to please Darkseid, but why? Also, I still think the balance is a bit of with the story arcs for are hero's. For me, the Flash feels like he has no real reason to be here other than he's fast and funny. But beside all that, it's a joy to watch this story be told in the right way. Zack Snyder clearly knew what he was doing. This feels like a fully fleshed out superhero movie. Maybe a bit to long, but still kept me hooked for the entire runtime. Every character has emotions and reasoning for their actions. This makes the fight scenes so much more powerful and fun to watch. The dramatic moments don't feel forced and fit very well in the story. Even the new characters get their own little moments to shine. All I can end with is, Mister Snyder, thank you for service.", "So glad we got this": "I hated the original justice league movie, and when I heard Zack Snyder's cut was going to be released, I had no idea that the movie would be so different from the original. This movie improves on every aspect from the original and more.", "Good, could've been great": "The story is great, it got some unexpected turns, and it's dark enough to become exciting. But a great story has to be told in a right way to become great.There are a few things that drags this movie down, in my opinion. The script is ok, it has some weird choice of words and phrases. The movie has it's very cool parts, but overall the CGI is a bit clumsy, on the boarder line of bad in some places. The movement of objects and people is weird several times, and the scenes doesn't always match when comparing movements. I can clearly see where they used animation, or where they filmed in a studio. It's almost like I'm watching a in-game-movie. It's a little grainy, and it almost becomes too obvious.What I love about movies today, specifically in Marvels movies, the CGI is believable and great, almost to the point where you no longer see it. It's art. The technology has become so stunningly amazing over the last decade, but it's almost like DC Comics is stuck in the past. I expected more from a movie made with today's technology.This movie is saved by a great story, and the scenery is otherwise good. I just wish they spent more time cleaning it up, and made the make it more flawless.", "I literally cried - it deeply touched me": "I still can't believe why WB didn't want to release that version in the first place.The movie touches on so many social issues nowadays. In 2021 even more needed than it was in 2019. Just take the time to get invested in this world. You might actually understand and like it.", "They shouldn't have released the first version": "First one badZach Snyders epicMuch more depth in Zach's version.

Dear Warner Bros, please #restorethesnyderverse!", "\"They wanted me back for a reason, I need to find out why.\" - Superman": "Zack Snyder's Justice LeagueThis film is an entirely different animal. From it's opening frames, the chills begin to creep up your spine and down your arms... and you'll know you're in for a BRAND NEW experience.The behind the scenes story, of the Snyder Cut has become infamous. The film tragically underwent a massive overhaul at the behest of Warner Brothers. The studio brought in a new director, after Zack Snyder and his wife Deborah Snyder suffered a great ordeal. The Snyder's attempted to push on, but to no avail... and the studio pumped out Joss Whedon's butchered version of a Zack Snyder film.After a long, and tiresome campaign, by fans and filmmakers alike... we have THE SNYDER CUT!The film unfolds to an expansive world that shows you a glimpse of what Mr. Snyder had in store for the Amazons and the Atlanteans. This brief look gave off Tolkien vibes in its execution. The film truly jives without issue, it's musical score by Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg), absolutely elevates the film to an entirely different level.The film took me on a rollercoaster of emotion, ranging from cheer to pure dread, and occasionally sadness. The film strengthens this set of actors as their respective roles. Ben Affleck is BATMAN, Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill is SUPERMAN, Jason Momoa is AQUAMAN, Ezra Miller is FLASH, and without doubt... RAY FISHER IS ABSOLUTELY CYBORG! Not to mention an incredible cast of VILLAINS!This is a massive win for film fans and lovers of the creative arts. #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "We do this the old way": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is by far the best DCEU film as of right now (hoping more of Zack's vision will be shown). At first I was very sceptical due to Zack's previous films but this movie as long as it is, is so very good. I was hesitant about it because of how they were trying to put in so many more characters without prior introductions and/or solo films. But the way it's handled in this was much better than I anticipated. Cyborg and the Flash are the best parts of this movie and it's so sad that they had so much cut in the theatrical release. As a mostly Marvel fan with some DC favourites, this is way up there and I now hope that Zack Snyder is given the chance to fulfil the DCEU's Justice League trilogy.", "Nonsensical": "A jumbled mess. Seems like a film adaptation of what it would look like if a kid was playing with all the different toys in his toybox...terrible...", "Superb, gets better with each rewatch.": "There are not many super hero movies where I keep thinking about its story, character arcs, deeper meanings and from which I'm humming its music for days, heck weeks after seeing it. There have been a few over the last 4 decades, notably Superman The Movie, The Dark Knight trilogy, The Guardians of The Galaxy movies, Wonder Woman and Infinity War. Most other super hero movies I've seen have often been quite meh/forgettable to frustrating (\"Iron Man 3\", \"Endgame\", \"Age of Ultron\") to near unwatchable (\"Ghost Rider 2\", \"Ant Man and The Wasp\").Zack Snyder's Justice League can now be added to that first love affair list.It is quite incredible how different it is to the first version by Joss Whedon. There is far more context, far better pacing, far less nonsense humour, far more cool humour, far more story, far more heart. Obviously some of this is down to the running time but it isn't just that. There is a far greater balance of the 6 super heroes on display. They get treated equally and all play an important part in the story. It really bothered me how awful the newly shot Joss Whedon scenes were in 2017 when I saw Justice League then (the moustache nonsense, the nonsense Superman vs Flash race at the end and the stupid \"Do you bleed\" scenes). The whole resurrection of Superman seemed very Frankenstein-esque. It seems to play out quite differently here somehow even though many of the same scenes are used. The atmosphere is just very different and gains far more of my appreciation.Cutting the excellent Flash rescue scene (brought me near tears) and so much of Cyborg's story seems insane and also somewhat racist. To top that off with the moustache thing I get the impression Warner Brothers were far more concerned with movie deadlines and probably afraid of Marvel rather than focusing on making a good sold film. They obviously should have waited on Snyder to be able to return and at least Cavill IF you are going to do any reshoots.Regardless, in this version the music is also absolutely stellar (sorry, far better than the likes of Elfman and Silvestri are now doing and I have been a huge fan of their earlier works) and probably my favourite score in a super hero movie since the John Williams Superman and Hans Zimmer Dark Knight days.The new Superman theme when Superman is protecting Cyborg (\"immovable\") is absolute perfection. There is a good use of drums and dynamics and memorable themes scattered around where needed. Perhaps there is a little too much overuse of the Wonder Woman vocal every time we see her. It probably should have been alternated with her electric cello theme more. Other than that the music was great for the entire 4 hour runtime.To me Zack Snyder's DC movies have gotten better after each one. I wasn't a huge fan of Man of Steel at first at all, but I did really like Batman vs Superman, especially the longer version. It seemed to humanise Superman far more, and we also really understand Batman's drive to create the Justice League after his first obsession with killing Superman, it is his redemption he must see through regardless of what the cost. It plays out well here. What is it with Warner Brothers not wanting Snyder to tell his entire story every time? It seems to work so much better when Snyder can do what he wants with less studio interference.Regardless, I found after Justice League I wanted to go back and I have indeed watched MoS and BvsS again and explore more of the backstories and setup (little details such as the Joker card make you wonder just how much Snyder and/or his writers had planned - intriguing). Next I will give Wonder Woman and Aquaman probably another spin. I love it when a sequel can in fact make previous instalments grow on you. Much to Snyder's credit for achieving that here.After seeing Endgame (a huge letdown for me) and Zack Snyder's Justice League I am far more intrigued to know what (could) have happened next with the DC heroes. It seems to me the Justice League are far more unified than the Avengers and there are just so many more stories to tell. It is a huge disappointment the studio will not continue with this series of events and with these exact character incarnations. I would have liked to have seen another 2 Man of Steel movies with Cavill, a Ben Affleck Batman trilogy and at least one stand alone movie for Cyborg and one for Flash. It is perhaps too late for most of that to happen now.Rounding the Justice League off with another 2 super long Zack Snyder sequels telling us about the dystopian Darkseid future and of course its inevitable resolution would have been epic.A shame this will not happen.At least here we have a good movie that can be enjoyed over and over again and sometimes it's best to leave things open. Telling stories that people are mostly dreaming of sometimes does not work out THAT well (see the Star Wars prequels and sequels).The only downside I can think of is the 4:3 aspect ratio and perhaps the somewhat over-stretching of the end, but I appreciate the Batman dream scene is a final look into the Snyderverse, so it's best we have it than not. A cinema version most likely would have had to have been cut down and indeed leave the original Luthor scene as a postcredit one. But as a producer / movie executive I really would have used an upper limit of say 200 minutes after seeing ALL this material. Quite stellar. To leave almost 50% on the cutting room floor as they did seems insane.Definitely a movie I'll be ordering on Blu Ray and will treasure forever.9/10.", "The Snyder Cut Movement Proves Dreams Do Come True": "Waking up at 6 AM to watch this movie was so well worth it. I can't complain about it being 4 hours long when it's such a great film that it doesn't feel like 4 hours!! I planned to take a break halfway through, but didn't because I was so into it from start to finish!!Finally seeing Darkseid in live action was truly a hit! Ray Porter certainly brings out the meanancing tyrant he is and that's what makes him great!!I hope us fans will get to see JL2 and JL3 with Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Amy Adams, and the entire cast because they were all 10/10 in this film! Bringing out the true nature of each character and I can't see anyone else playing the roles of the Justice League!Truly grateful to have seen it and for all the fans and Zack Snyder!! Thank you Zack!!", "Finally a movie that doesn't give more screen time to popular characters": "I'm amazed that in this movie, the characters who are very important to the plot got more scenes instead of the popular characters like superman and batman. The story is good, makes me glued to the film. As a woman, I'm super sick of movies who gives clich\u00e9 lines and objectifying us, and less character depth, but justice league gives us none of that. Not only with wonder woman, but with the rest of the characters, even the cameos. More diversity too, it represents the reality where in big cities the population are diverse.Lastly, why it is not a 10 for me is the slow-mo, it is a bit too much at one point. I like slow-mo, but this movie has slow-mo too much until i noticed in the beginning of the movie. Some slow-mo are good, but there's other scene where I felt no need slow mo or reduce the duration at least.", "I Hate it": "The Story was Awful just stupid Violant and Stupid Writing , the only thing that It like was well played Actor's , it was just a copy of 2017 version\nAfter all it just wanted to weak Batman and execute the character for I hope never happens next movie\nIt broth Darksied so soon\nAnd Steppenwolf was so weak.", "This is how it should of been": "This cut was what the movie needed in the first place. It showed each hero's capabilities and more. Just a big shame that the franchise is not continuing with the series. We could of had some great chapters leading up to the finale.", "Better but still not enough": "If you liked Batman Vs Superman this is the movie for you, but for myself the dceu once again fails to have character development even with a 4 hour long movie... It's better than the theatrical version but still didn't do it for me.", "This is a bad movie but i admit that it's better than Jl 2017": "The script suffers from plot convenience, cgi looks outdated, the color grading it's better than JL 2017 but still looking fake, the action scenes are better but the powers are inconsistent.\nI don't even like the costume design except batman's costume, the whole zack snyder universe it's so nihilistic.", "The movie that is should have been!": "Great movie. Long movie, but totally worth it. Be sure to have a weekend to watch this and don't leave the room without pausing.", "Epic \ud83d\udc4f, just Epic \ud83d\udc4f!!": "This! This! This right here is DC at it's best! This was so excellent. It had everthing I've always hoped for from a DC film. Now EVERYTHING! This, including the first Wonder Woman, are tops on my list of go-to DC films.", "Just awesome": "Well.. I enjoyed the whole 4 hours! It would be awesome if they would do a sequel! I'd definetly watch it. So yes please for Justice League 2!!", "So that's what we have when the studio lets the director work with complete freedom?": "There are times when we finish watching a movie and feel happy, it's such a genuine and sincere joy that it becomes difficult to describe it in a review, maybe anyone who has felt the same as I understand what I mean.I remember when Batman vs Superman was announced and good, the hype was real, we went to the movies on the opening day and it was a great experience, of course, after a while thinking about the film and its choices I ended up finding various defects and script problems, but still it was a good movie, the look of Zack Snyder is so unique and attractive, besides it was the first time we were seeing the trinity on the big screen, the emotion was already taking care of us without much difficulty, it is not a movie that I try to defend at all costs but still i can enjoy it.So Justice League was announced right after Wonder Woman, for a moment I thought \"ok, maybe we're going too fast with this universe just to reach the competition\", but still was anxious, after all, it was the Justice League, again we went in the opening week, and at the end of the movie my face was on the floor of so much sadness, in short the film became a cheap copy of Avengers, and not that I did not like the marvel universe, some of my favorite movies carry the name of those heroes, but the biggest problem was how much it was foreseeable, the next day I no longer cared about the movie, and it really annoyed me, we're talking here of characters that emerged in the golden age of heroes , they were the first and are in our hearts to this day, it is almost unfair with a fan doing any work with these characters.Of course, after we understood everything behind the production of this film we understood that it was not the fault of the actors, screenwriters, much less the directors involved, the great villain and cause of the failure of that film was the WB itself.Then a phenomenon came to pass, the entire internet including with those who participated in this film began to raise the #releasethesnydercut and amazingly Warner gave in and gave the green light for Zack to complete his work, which makes me think, shouldn't it always be like this? Imagine if all directors had the approval to create their works freely? Of course there are all the rules to enter the cinema, but we would still have more sincerity and passion in every movie we see, and this one is full of it!Zack Snyder made the 2017 film totally disposable after the release of its version, there is nothing in this film that has not been better than its previous version, the characters have a greater development, relevance to plot, their attitudes and actions have consequences, humor is in the right place and with the right characters, the action scenes are infinitely better and worthy of a movie of heroes, it is ridiculous today to think of a story of these characters where they are not completely invincible, as much as some think that the exaggerated action of Snyder ends up tireing the viewer, I think from the moment we understand that they are practically semi gods this \"exaggeration\" becomes understandable.By the way, the most important part of a hero movie is here, the inspiration, we have dozens of films with this theme coming out every year, but most of them forget that in addition to an interesting story and a fun action, a hero should give us hope, and I speak clearly that this was one of the few in recent years that managed to get that message across.I respect the fact that Snyder didn't use any scene from Joss Whedon's cut, that's the complete view of him, and as for that he did not hold, everything that a fan of comics imagines on screen is here, I heard a person say the following phrase \"It's like they give budget to a child of 13 years passionate about heroes make the story that she always wanted.\" and I could not be more cheerful in agreeing with this placement, it's like a great graphic novel alive, with a rich universe and full of paths to which we walk after reading the last page.Now what i'm most glad about is the fact that I felt actually witnessing the JUSTICE LEAGUE, it may be kind of unfair to compare with the Marvel Universe since they had a decade to consolidate their characters, but what they needed some movies to make me like some characters this movie achieved in just four hours, of course the film has its problems like the excess of slow motion or some less neat CGI effects, but as I started this review I end up saying, there are few movies that can convey a real passion for design and genuine happiness to the audience, and this certainly ignores defects that can be seen.Now it remains to be seen what the WB will do with what was left by Zack, and for him I just have to congratulate me, for sure his daughter Autumn is proud whatever plan she is in.", "JL movie how it was supposed be out in the first place": "As a long time DC and Marvel movies fan, i actually loved original JL.\nHowever, after watching Zack Snyder's version - i have to admit that ZS's version was much much better. 4 hours of not being distracted by phone and looking into all the details - just another proof that it is done very well.\nWithout spoilers, this version fills up the gaps between different parts of the movie that left us (viewers) guessing. much more focus on a story line for all the characters and making all that knowledge about the villains and other facts more realistic rather than \"suddenly they know\".\nAnd fights are more brutal and more interesting. some many parts of the ZS's version are different to the original one. Absolutely a must to watch!", "This movie is still boring.": "Now it's just boring and long. It feels more intentional than the 2017 theatrical release but the number of times I thought \"Why did they include this scene?\" was obnoxious given the bloated runtime. The Steppenwolf and Cyborg character development efforts were better but not enough to make a meaningful difference.I had a great English teacher in HS who taught me there's an important difference between something being good and liking something. You can like something that is not good and you can dislike something that is good. I think a lot of reviewers are confusing liking this with it being good.", "Up 3 Stars": "Let's be fair the Justice was ok not terrible... This vision for the film was much better... Some Annoying things... You don't need the strange Amazonian themed Audio everytime wonder women enters a scene.. she probably heard that song when she takes a dump!Amber Heard a terrible English accent.. urghOverall they wouldn't have needed to release this film of they did things properly! You cant just mash superheros together like that without a proper back story... This eliminates that slightly hence the viewing time of 4hrsI liked drink a redbull first though...the Titanic took less time to sink.", "Wow!!": "Like many, I was worried about watching this remake.

The advantage of DC is that it works serious movies so DC shouldn't fire Zack Snyder. He did better than I expected in his Justice League film's. After reviewing the ratings of the critics of this film, I decided that Joss Whedon bought them)))\nWhat I don't like about the film is that it has 6 episodes and is square and it seemed strange to me that Superman became a megasuperman again. Stepenwolf's portrayal in the film is remarkable, and the emotional scenes are well done", "goosebumps throught the movie": "This movie is the definition of what dceu ever wanted to be.Great character development and good plot keeps you invested throughout the movie.", "Zack snyder": "This movie is something..........

I like some of both worlds, although i have to admit, that Marvel had a much better concept and management behind the scenes and so their movies are more entertaining for me in general.Nevertheless, i was really impressed by Zack Snyders vision of Justice League, which has basically nothing in common with the theatrical version, except for the basic plot. With this movie Zack proves that DC can be different, more darker, serious and unique at the same time.If you watch the movie more than one time you will notice that Zack already had a vision for JL2. Especially some of Batmans Dreams and the Epilogue clearly go in that direction as well as a much bigger threat coming. And i am totally hyped to see the dark visions come to live.", "Most excellent": "This movie was so good. The action, the story... all of it. I do not usually write reviews on imdb, but I really, really enjoyed this movie. I saw it on HBOMax and highly recommend viewing if you like a good action movie.

WB shouldn't mess this up going forward like they always do.", "4 hours long!": "Well, I must say that the very best thing about this movie is that it is 4 hours long. After a year & a half of too much TV I find it harder than ever to find stuff to watch. It looks like I will finish although it is kind of a pain since the HBO app on the old Roku makes me start from the beginning every time I start it.

Everything is perfect, the music, the actors...", "An Epic Masterpiece which Honors the Lore": "The depth of care that must have gone into creating this story is nothing less than one of the best creations I have ever witnessed in the movie industry. At its height I would rank it as high as the quality of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is high praise coming from me. Even after watching it on HBO, I would pay to see it at a movie theater with my family. This movie has brought DC back in the eyes of this fan and made it relevant again. It stayed true to its lore and has opened many doors for some of my favorite comics to be made into live action films. I can only hope the care and consideration that went into this film goes into those. There aren't enough thank yous in the world for Zack Snyder, for creating this miraculous work of art.", "Better than the original- but...": "The original release was a hodge podge of stuff that just didn't flow whatsoever. It really wasn't good. I don't know what's 'up' with the super hero genre in the past 5 years or so, but battle sequences that just go on and on and on and on and on- do NOT make a good film. I noticed this in one of the Transformer movies. It just went on forever. I saw the same thing again in the Man of Steel. Then came the Avengers and they did it as well, then Batman Vs Superman.... ENOUGH.The Zack Snyder cut is very much the same, though there are some compelling things. There are also long, posed shots that are really needless. This isn't a freaking painting, it's a movie. No need to focus on the JL standing there for a minute as the sun comes up. Just overblown.For my money, the best of the lot was the Nolan Batman flicks. No extra bs, just STORY with a direction.The stuff with The Flash was way way too long. So many of his scenes were just drawn out, and this from a guy that's supposed to be fast. The battle at the end was way too long and was just repeating what had happened a while earlier.I DID like Bruce Wayne's dream at the end. That was a cool touch, though I really don't know what it mean other than setting up the possible Alternate Universe thing. Are we going to go in a new Star Trek direction where the characters and the worlds are now reimagined?A lot of the CGI was good, but so much of the film was cgi that at points, it got tiresome. The slow motion shots were also rather silly.The villains with the deeper than the Grand Canyon voices... so many movies do this. It's gotten really stale. This one had 3 of them that just ran together for me. Best movie Superhero villain was Ledger's Joker and also Nicholson's Joker. So far, the dumbest have been any of the filmed Lex Luthors. This guy was particularly annoying in this and the BVS film. Why the guy from Smallville didn't get these roles, I'll never know. He was great in that role. The best Luthor there has been.I thought Aflec was a decent Batman and looked the most close to some of the comics, though there have been many. I thought that. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was also really great. A character that I never really cared much about in the comics, she did a wonderful job.", "Far, far, far better than the original": "I am a huge DC fan from 30 years ago (comics), but Justice League movie (Whedon version) was fairly disappointing. I enjoyed it but it could have been so much better. It could have been this version!Even the scenes you recognize from the original are better since a lot of it was reshot.Absolutely recommended. Batman isn't useless here, Flash isn't useless (no Superman showing him up at the end), and Darkseid appears! He who makes Thanos out to be a chump in the power scalings. Although Thanos is a more interesting character for sure. The other characters are more fleshed out as well.Watch it!", "Its an awesome move": "Its nothing close to the thrash by whedon.

The entire 4 hours of it.This was everything we didn't get in 2017 and more.It had rich backstories of the characters,proper interesting dialogue and gosh the action scenes were just amazing and badass .I wasn't at all bored for one minute.All I have to say is what Joss whedon did in 2017 should be a crime against humanity(lock him up)! Thank you Zack Sydner \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffeand i honestly hope we get to continue and finish this story arc.#restorethesydnerverse", "College Courses Will Be Taught About This Movie": "I never watched the original Justice League, I knew that the movie was not worth my time. I knew that the original Justice League was going to flop because of Joss Wheadon. Go back and watch the first \"Avengers\". Notice how it does not hold up compared to other Marvel movies. Joss Wheadon pitched the billion dollar idea that it the MCU, he wanted WB to make 20+ movies an have us wait 10 years for a resolution to the stories that we are so heavily invested in. Snyder proved with this movie that you don't need 20 movies to expand a universe. Snyder made three movies that already have a larger universe than the MCU. It took the MCU 13 years to introduce the multiverse, the multiverse would have been introduced in 2017 when this movie was originally supposed to come out. This movie is a case of how one movie can introduce many characters, have many moving parts, and still over perform expectations. Snyder took the worst superhero movie of all time (yes worse than Green Lantern) and turned it into a movie that is, in my opinion, 10x better than all of the MCU movies (with the exception of Infinity War) combined. The last 10 minutes of this movie is the best part of this movie. If you haven't seen it yet or haven't gotten to the end, I urge you to watch it, and hope on this bandwagon to get the Snyderverse to be restored. The DCEU needs it, the fans need it, and most of all, Zach Snyder needs it.", "OMGGG!!!! thank you Zack Snyder for restoring Justice League": "Omg this is by far the best dc movie ever.It gave me litteral chills.Now I love this version of the flash even more I didn't really like him at first but now omg I got no words to describe this masterpiece Zack Snyder gave us.Now I totally forgot about the other Justice League I'm like other Justice League who\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05.Now i'm just waiting for a part 2,3 and four", "Immeasurable better than the original": "Its a long movie but worth every second of it. I feel like the original was a cheap version and this is the thing. The original is like watered down while this one is an aged whisky/wine with dept and superior quality being delivered. So many actor were cut on the original version and for what? Cheesy quotes and worse battles? I recomend everyone to watch this version.", "Zack Snyder is vindicated!": "Now this is the Justice League we all deserve.Whedon's JL had so many unecessary scenes, like the whole opening sequence, the Russian family, but left out so much of the set up. The difference is so stark, its night and day, literally.Batman is still a bad ass and doesn't get taken out of the game with an injury.\nStephenwolf is more brutal, more imposing, yet has a vulnerability.\nThe Flash is no longer annoying and almost useless.\nSuperman isn't cheesy (in the end) and doesn't just save the dayThe whole movie has a different, more serious tone, the story holds together a lot better.The only thing that let it down was the Music, it didn't carry any of the themes from BvS, MoS or WW, but that's like 0.01 of a rating.I just hope that WB take note, this is the winning formula.#Restorethesnyderverse", "So this is what all the drama was about?": "I'm sorry, but after all the #ReleaseThe SnyderCut drama, this is the end result? MEH!", "DC needs Zack!": "Gloomy harder and not as cheesy as Joss Whedon's version! Snyder cut has everything you could wish for as a DC fan. Justice League, unlike Zack Snyders cut, was such a disaster that you prefer to destroy the TV while watching it. But not Snyder's version, no! Zack shows how it goes !!!! I found it great. Doesn't want to tell much the best way to look for yourself and expect some cool surprises. Please Zack if you read that and you haven't seen Whedon's version yet, then don't do it, you'll be disappointed.", "Thank you Zack Snyder!!!": "This version is everything the first movie isn't and should have been!! Character development, cinematography, audio, music and even the CGI was immaculate! You will be on the edge of your seat and emotionally invested. I appreciate them taking the time to delve a bit deeper into the character development and the setup for future projects. Casting Jared Leto as Joker was EVERYTHING!! He was the only amazing thing about Suicide Squad and he commands the screen here as well! He demands your attention when his part comes up! So much presence and just amazing how he embodies his character as Joker! This movie is amazing!!", "DCU dissapoints again": "Boring and way to long..\nA little bit beter then de orininal but still lame.", "Excited and Regretful": "Such a great movie, didn't expect the Zack Snyder's JL would be this good, it proly enhanced the characters in the previous movie.

The Snyder cut is twice as long and probably more than twice as bad since Snyder is still Snyder: a less than mediocre hack (albeit with delusions of grandeur) who has never directed a good movie in his life. His pretensions of being an auteur even lead him to use an attention grabbing 4:3 aspect ratio, which is decidedly odd for this type of picture and does it no favors. (Unlike some know nothing comments I have seen, I have no problem with a 4:3 ratio, also known as Academy Standard; there are countless wonderful shows and films in this ratio, including virtually every movie from Hollywood's Golden Age. But is doesn't work as well for a modern action movie as a wider ratio.) There are countless fan boys who apparently consider the talent challenged Snyder a genius. Hopefully, they will get older and acquire better taste.", "\u00c9pic and impressive": "It is sad to see what happens when a studio does not trust the vision of its directors. That happens here the old version of Whedon feels like a Frankenstein full of holes in which neither the heroes nor the villain ends up shining in This version obviously for its four hours we see each character well developed, each situation well explained, they are no longer exciting, the backbone of the plot remains the same but in this cut it feels much more organic. Something that is most astonishing is the new role that Cyborg takes since in the last installment he was only a clown relegated to last place, in this version it is the opposite, together with a more developed flash they steal the film and become practically on the protagonists. but don't get me wrong the movie also takes the time to redeem Batman who in the last installment was also a little more ridiculed, Diana is more imposing in this version as well. and thank you for removing the horrible red color from the old installment . in general terms Snyder delivered by bringing a much better quality product than Whedon. hopefully this is taken into account by the executive geniuses at Warner.", "Restore the snyder verse": "Best DC movie ever!

That's difficult for me to say, mainly because I preferred the DC comics/universe to Marvel growing up, but this movie is all over the place and probably shouldn't have been made. It seems as if DC is seeing the success of the MCU and trying to ride that wave by forcing the DC Universe in your face without building it up slowly and organically like Marvel did.

Usually the higher the expectations the bigger the disappointment, but in this case it was the complete opposite.I was totally blown away by this movie. It was an epic cinematographic experience that only happens one in while, and we should really be grateful that the streaming services nowadays make it possible for us to have such a movie with an extremely long runtime something that wouldn't have been possible in Cinema even if Zack wasn't replaced for the theatrical cut. from the very first scene of the movie you realize that this is a different version, that this isn't the cheesy shallow two hours of nonsense we got back in 2017. From that first scene you get the feel right away that this is in perfect continuity with BvS 2016, that this is the real deal .The characters have real backstories now and you can feel attached to them and you actually care about what happens, the visual effects are much better and the dark tone of Snyder better fits the universe that was actually built on this dark tone to begin with, the final act of the movie was handled so much better and the epilogue just shows how much stuff is left to be told in this story and I really hope the success of the Snyder cut will make DC change their strategy and stop giving us useless movies about secondary characters that we actually don't give a damn about and finally restore the original plans for the franchise before it's too late...Restore the SNYDERVERSE !", "why didn't they show this one in the beginning?!!!": "This one actually gave equal focus on every league members.

Even supes himself is likable and functional in this. And we get to see Batman in action taking on full laser beam force and parademons with his wit and gadgets and martial arts. How cool is that?!!! Instead of that standing around being a rich old dumb in the original. Diana is awesome as usual, she is like that team player super strong support in any MMORPG. The Amazonian chant in her every scene is kind of too much though. The way they slaughter steppenwolf, just speechless. What a great day to have eyes.

I personally enjoyed it more than the theatrical version that was released way back when. This film feels more complete and fleshed out story wise.All of the characters were given their time. However I still feel as though characters such as Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman should have had solo films before this movie and before forming the team. That's just my personal preference. I did feel a sort of disconnect to The Flash and Cyborg. I'm just not connecting with Ezra's Barry Allen like I would like to. The character didn't really land for me overall here, although I did really like his scene at the end of the film. That was great! Aquaman was still cool in this however I do like James Wan's visuals of Atlantis and the under water stuff in his solo film better but that didn't take anything away for me. Cyborg had a very compelling story, I think I just needed a deeper dive into him and more time. Batman and Superman were great! I still love Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck in those roles. And Wonder Woman was amazing as well. Great action with her and the Amazon's. I loved the expansion on the Amazon's here and their relationship with the Atlanteans. I thought that was great set up if they were to do anything with that in the future.Steppenwolf was a better more compelling villain here in this version as well. I really felt the stakes with him. He was utilized well and I felt the massive threat level there. Darkseid too, I thought was great from what we saw of him.Overall, I really enjoyed this film. There were some minor things I disagreed with and wasn't a fan of but also things I didn't fully understand. Some of the style/design choices and elements didn't land for me and some of the choices made for certain characters. But, regardless still a solid film! Definitely one of the better DC films and I would 100% recommend it.", "That's the way films should be made": "Absolutely brilliant, filled all the gaps in,keeps you wanting more, the characters and the action scenes are more in depth.

Though I liked him at the end.Didn't really like Jared Leto Joker talk with Batman( I don't know, that conversation was good but didn't really like Jared's performance).Barry's saving Iris also didn't really work from me because of the situation of how it happened, I mean why wouldn't the guy driving the car just stop it to pick the burger up(Yeah I know its nitpicky).Some scenes were just there, like the singing of an islandic woman after Aqua man leaves, it felt as if the movie just stopped.Every time Wonder Woman fights there is a weird chorus or what I didn't like whatsoever, I think her theme is great in itself.Didn't really like the use of slow motion at certain scenes.Batman still felt a little useless to me (might just be me)The goodEverything else was very well executed, Darkseid was good,\nSteppenwolf was a huge improvement,\nCyborg full backstory was given to us(Which could have been given in a movie before it) which is pretty essential for us to like that character and also to the story.The Flashback fight scene(the one with Darkseid and the all the old gods) felt much better and epic.The battle on Themyscira was much better and didn't feel like that the Amazons were that weak as I felt while watching the Whedon's version.And the final battle was amazing with Flash really using his powers(TIME TRAVEL scene was AWESOME), and the \"something darker\" fate received by Steppenwolf was amazing, THE FINAL BATTLE was just EPIC.All in all, every character felt important rather than like Superman just coming in and doing essentially everything. DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING.", "It is a new movie!": "It is amazing how two equal footage, after editing can have such different results.

The effects aren't great, the script is worse, and the acting is stale. Sure it is better than the theatrical version but it's not good. It makes more sense...but even with FOUR hours it still doesn't really explain much of what's going on. Including Easter eggs and hints to things that will never happen doesn't make it good. Throwing all the characters together in one big melting pot is not the answer if we have no emotional connection to any of the characters. The cherry on top, Snyder is just not good. He draws everything way out. Exaggerates every CGI element so it just looks like a video game. Nothing is grounded, the dialogue is just there to pretend there is a story and feed the trailers, and the characters are FLAT. Applaud nothing, this was a massive waste of time and resources, twice. If DC had someone at the helm with a real plan to keep Snyder in check I'm sure it could have been decent. This drivel is not worth the hype or four hours of anyone's time.", "Zsjl review": "Wow!!!

Feels short for a long film..", "This Justice League rocks lika a HURRICANE": "Snyder Cut Justice League is way better than the original that came in 2017 and also, the duration is more than 4 hours.The duration fits in well and complements the story. The original was a dud and I was extremely disappointed after watching it in a movie hall. That's why Warner Bros decided to spend an addition of $70 million to get this version of Snyder.It works and honestly, I did not expect it to be this good. Joss Whedon, director of Avengers and Age of Ultron, stepped in when Zack had to leave the movie. His daughter died. What we got was a terrible mash-up that no one wanted for real.This one is true to its DNA that's there in comics. The plot has major inspiration from these comics and it fits in well. Zack took this a step further and changed almost everything about the movie. The beginning. The Middle. The end. They look and feel different.Zack has got rid of silly humor. It is more graphical. The expanded backstories of Cyborg and Flash are very nice. You have Martian Manhunter (no major help in narration but a treat for all the fans) and Deathstroke pop-up. Plenty of scenes around Darkseid as the ultimate villain. And, of course, there's a newly filmed epilogue that leans toward the story of the Injustice graphic novel series. All good. Very good.Plenty of slow-mo and stretched scenes will spoil a bit of fun. Otherwise, it is a great movie. A movie that exists because of the fans and that's why it will appeal to all the DC fans big time.I am going for my third-time watch!", "A genuine success": "Now this is what I call a genuine success. Despite all leaks and spoilers, The movie achieved its rightful rate.\nI can't help it but to remember now the real reason behind Avengers endgame high rate which was discretion... I remember no spoilers, not too many trailers, and also the fans who watched it, they were so serious about not giving spoilers...

Way much better than Josstice League", "Zack Snyder is a Legend": "Masterpiece, underrated, work of Art, Brilliant, Intense...\nPerfect follow up from Man of steel > Batman VS Superman > Justice League#RestoreTheSnyderVersePerfect cast for Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash", "Amber ruined it...": "Seeing her in this movie ruined it for me. There was no need for her!", "Zack Snyder is a genre.": "4 hrs of visual extravaganza.\nNow it all makes sense. From the horrors & disappointments of 2017 Joss Whedon's JL, this Zack Snyder's JL is a whole new movie altogether. The detailing in screenplay of Zack Snyder's JL answers every question left by 2017's one, fills every plot hole abandoned by Joss Whedon's version.\nStarting from the very opening title sequence itself Snyder starts telling his story. Every thing about Snyder's JL is epic. The Amazons trying to stop Steppenwolf, Diana knowing about the darkest lord of the universe, the war of old gods defeating 'Uxas', Flash's final act, ...boyy everything was goosebumps stuff. The desaturated colour grading and vibrant colours were eye pleasing and had set the tone perfectly.\nWhat 2017 JL failed to do, Snyder's JL did with utmost perfection:\n>The backstory arcs of Cyborg and Flash\n>Lois Lane becoming the key\n>Reasons for resurrecting Superman\n>Giving importance to the side characters\n>And most importantly the emotional depth. Flash & Cyborg didn't added any weightage to 2017 one. But now here, they are the real MVPs. Clearly Snyder's vision was butchered back then. You don't particularly need to be a DC fan to say this.\nThe glimpses of The Lord Darkseid alone were so much heavy and were spot on. The resonating voice whenever he speaks sent chills down my spine. Can't wait to see the character arc of THE most feared dark lord of every universe.\nDone with #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. Onto #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Way better than the theatrical version": "Snyder's cut is way way way better than the theatrical one... this one offer more footage, different climatic scenes and it really focuses on the individual characters on how they teamed up.

I don't care how you watch it, JUST WATCH IT.", "Finally the fans are vindicated": "This movie proves beyond a doubt the real problems with DC.\nTheir real villains in DC are the bigwig idiots calling the shots there. Zack was setting up the DC movieverse the same way Marvel did theirs, just too bad the DC idiot brigade got in the way.\nI mean, look at the recent junk from DC like Batgirl (I mean really), Stargirl (I think I passed out) and WW84 (oh god, if I could just wish it away)...And here we have an amazing movie that would not have seen the light of day without the fans clamouring for it.Time for the DC idiots to wake up and trot off...", "Zack, I want my 4 hours back": "Do not walk into this film expecting the greatest superhero movie ever made. And please ignore all those \"10/10\" ratings since none of them is a true rating to the film itself, they are just the community's way of welcoming back Zack Snyder to the movie industry and to the DC universe.\nI know that Zack is capable f delivering a much better experience than this 4 hour drag. The only difference between this movie and the \"fake\" one is the much better final battle between Steppenwolf and the JL. The scene lasts a total of 30~35 minutes, and the rest of the movie is wasted on slow motion scenes of the Amazon army with a very annoying background song that repeats every time Wonder Woman, or any of the Amazons, show up.\nThe story is the same exact story of the previous JL, but this time Zack added an origin sequence to Cyborg and and introductory scene to the flash. He even refined the Steppenwolf attack on Themyscira and added a few scenes for Darkseid.\nZack also added a better version to the \"I am too soon\" scene, letting us know that resurrected superman actually tore Earth apart, and the flash traveled back in time to inform Batman that Lois Lane is the key to calm Superman down after the resurrection, an advice that the future Joker gave them (yeah, don't ask).\nIn the battle scene between JL and Steppenwolf, Cyborg needed extra power to enter the motherboxes and split them apart, so Flash had to run so fast to generate that energy, but Flash got shot by a lucky parademon. The plan failed and the motherboxes destroyed Earth, but during the blast, Flash moved much faster, traveled back in time, and gave Cyborg the energy at the right time, so they finally stopped the motherboxes and killed Steppenwolf right in front of Darkseid who was just watching and decided not to take any action against the JL for some reason.\nThe fight scene is much better that the previous because it shows us the nature of the challenge they were all facing. Batman and Flash had much better roles this time instead of their nonexistent effects in the previous film.\nThe worst parts about this film are mainly the slow motion Amazon warriors scenes and their background song. The background song that plays EVER SINGLE TIME WONDER WOMAN SHOWS UP. And the extremely under-powered Flash.\nThe movie does well in setting up the next sequels with its final scenes of Martian Manhunter, Deathstroke, and Lex Luthor.\nOverall, this movie is extremely disappointing. The entire story could have been wrapped up into a much better 2-hours version.\nAnd Zack, I am happy you are back in the DC world, But this is not on par with Man of Steel or Batman VS Superman. I hope these over hyped ratings do not boost your ego so much that you ruin this series even further. The Zack Snyder real comeback will be in his next DC movie, if he ever decides to continue. But this \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" is just a hype fest and its unusually high ratings is the fandom giving Zack a pat on the back.\n5/10", "I've seen this film twice now, and what the ****": "I watched this film immediately upon release and I thought to myself what did I just watch that was awful, so i went online to check what other people were saying and everyone is saying it's a masterpiece. I rewatched it this afternoon with my 3 roommates and I can confirm that this movie is a miserable slog, the first hour is the most well paced segment of the film and it really tapers off after that. Theres a bevy of questionable performances from the main cast as well as the majority of the ancillary characters, several plot contrivances, and an utter lack of grounded emotional exchanges which leads to characters like Cyborg (whom you are very clearly supposed to care about) as boring and uninteresting. I've seen the DCEU films preceding this one, so I've got all the necessary background info but this film simply fails to make these characters relatable or easy to sympathize with, as they dont act like humans (yes, yes, they're \"meta humans\", but if they dont come off as \"human\" (in the sense of the social construct, not in a biological sense) it's very hard to care about what happens to them), the only way I could personally imagine enjoying this film is if Batman V Superman is one of your favourite films, I myself dont care for that one but watchmen is one of my favourite movies so I'm not opposed to Snyder's style of filmmaking, this film is simply uninteresting and often bafflingly stupid.", "Snyder vs Whedon rise of justice": "One of few movies i will place along sides the gients such as Infinity War and Endgame.

Snyder's significant slow-motion scenes gave a lot of goosebumps. But I admit I don't like some vfx shots which are like too much and looks a bit video-game-y.

Its a B+ movie at best and thats expected considering it isnt really a new movie compared to the other one.

The storyline basically deals with the history & awakening of supervillain darkseid's three mother boxes, kept in three different worlds - the humans, the atlanteans & the amazons.Now the plot in nutshell goes somewhat like this. Bruce Wayne with his high ESP perceived some forthcoming danger. He tries befriending with aquaman to commence the justice league, but in vain. On the other hand, wonder woman after receiving the signal of imminent danger from the amazons, becomes partner with bruce. Slowly, they are also accompanied by the flash, cyborg & finally aquaman. All of them try to resurrect superman with the help of the third motherbox (the other two being already captured by darkseid's general steppenwolf). But unfortunately, lazarus superman with all forgotten past memories, tries to kill them. Though with the appearance of lois lane as the saviour of justice league, the famous five had a narrow escape. Meanwhile, steppenwolf attacks starlabs to get hold of the third box. But, cyborg's father Dr silas stone burnt himself alive along with the mother box, to mark the latter. Now, cyborg with his inbuilt electronic communication locates the abandoned city of pozharnov, where steppenwolf had established his kingdom. Thereafter follows a huge battle with a human & metahumans on one side and a militia of aliens on the other. At the last moment, with the arrival of Superman (who now luckily had come to his senses), the team of justice league were able to become victorious. In the epilogue, Bruce had a bit complicated horrifying nightmare of combating against superman.Now about the pros and cons of the movie - the cgi effect was magnificent, the plot location was mind-blowing, but the acting was a bit poor. I don't know whether the actors were paid more to act horribly in this movie. I like Ben affleck a lot, but still apologising for never accepting him as batman. Gal gaddot's action sequences are good... But her acting is really painful. Maybe the character of wonder woman bears that kind of stiffness. Ezra Miller (The flash) was able to create certain comical situations, which really gave life to this stale movie. Ray Fisher's (Cyborg) portrayal was brilliant. The expression of deep pain in his eyes due to unspoken sorrow, are the gifts of this movie. But, the star of this movie is undoubtedly aquaman Jason momoa. His prolific battling scenes & incidental quipping really stole the show. Henry cavill (superman) & Amy adams (lois lane) share a very little screen presence. But still they are able to leave an everlasting impression. Ray Porter & Ciaran Hinds voice overs to respectively darkseid & steppenwolf were also enjoyable.Postscript - this movie had a great potential but execution was a bit poor.", "As a COMIC FAN, Zack Snyder's Justice League is the best that ever happened to me.": "This movie is like a dream come true.

It has its flaws but is an improvement over 2017 studio cut.Postitives - every character is fleshed out, there are arcs here. Heroes have a heart and you truly invest in them. There is a real story here as well. Nothing feels rushed. Everyone feels more badass than they did in the original cut. Cyborg and Flash are probably the best parts. It's the first DC Snyder film that has organic humor in it and the change is welcome.Some negatives - 30 minutes of it could have easly been cut like the scene when Barry's saves Iris. It added nothing to the movie. The score is forgetable, amazon chanting theme was really annyoing. Steppenwolf is still a horrible antagonist. Yeah he looked better than in the studio cut but still he has no depth and serves just as a gate away to the Darkseid. Martian Manhunter is very unnecessary and feels way to forced. Some over repetitive elements like a slow mo scene every 10 minutes and almost every other person dying by getting their head smashed into a wall.Overall I think it's a great movie and it will probably be most generally liked Snyder DC movie. It has its flaws but the best parts are the characters, their story and their bonds and that outweighs all the other stuff.", "Great movie, bad format": "Let me be clear, this game is mile better than the original Justice league in every aspect except......the fornat, I don't care if it was shot in 4:3 for IMAX screens, this is a streaming release and in 2021 everyone has wide screens at home.

Also Zack Snyder does a wonderful job explaining the plot, the mother boxes, the villains, the story, history and the origin of almost every character.2. The reshoots and continuity. The characters are written as they were supposed to be written in this universe! Batman's character is a WORLD better than he was in Whedon's JL, except for one part. Wonder Woman's character and the way she's written is a beautiful combo of herself in BVS and the first Wonder Woman. Superman isn't giggling like in Whedon's JL but emotionally connected and invested and can literally act with his eyes alone. Cyborg actually HAS an emotional arc and story unlike before and Flash is still the same happy kid. Aquaman's character changed from the other JL and is more troubled and moved by compassion and misses his father. Lots of changes.3. The editing. The film is long yes but flows perfectly from scene to scene. The story doesn't move too slow but slowly builds and never loses the audience. The action scenes are amazing! You can tell that they were meant for a huge IMAX screen, someday it may be shown in theaters! The epilogue is the only section that may be a bit confusing for those who aren't super familiar with the DCEU. The exchange between Batman and Joker is so intense, my personal favorite! Long live the DCEU and ALL it's characters!Cons:1. Music. Only one song \"The Crew at War Power\" is the one worth downloading and moving in the film. The others are okay. Lots of moments where the music would've made the scenes a lot better but we're kind of left at just the scenes themselves.2. \"What are your superpowers again?\" says Barry \"I'm rich\" says Bruce. Honestly I was 100 percent sure that was a Whedon quote but it wasn't unfortunately. Dumb line I will always hate.3. If this is the end I would be disappointed. The ending leaves on so many wonderful opportunities and cliff hangers for this franchise to ever end. If this is the last DC film Zack Snyder ever does it would be a sad letdown because this was great and yet so much was left open for more discovery!10/10", "Terrible Film": "If you like Batman vs Superman this is right up your alley. 4:3 ratio screen and it's 4 hours of crap. If you like the fast and furious movies then you will like this", "A Fortnite movie?": "The movie is just like Fortnite, full of stupidly looking imaginative characters, which suits Fortnite fine, but it doesn't suit a movie.", "Awesome film, wish it was in 16:9 ratio!": "What a film, I really didn't like the original cut, this one bridges so many gaps make in that one. My only gripe is the fact it's in 4:3 ratio! I understand he did it to feel like your watching it in an imax theatre, but who has an imax at home!? Lol. We have widescreens, but it didn't make the film unbearable to watch, just a little annoying at times, thank go I have a 65 inch, I'd hate to have seen it on anything smaller.", "The best Snyder has created till yet": "It is true that this is far best justice league. Previously Snyder's been creating such movies but this was it . Only one thing that i did not understand why was martian manhunter disguised as Martha Kent when visiting Lois Lane? See there's always a mistake with snyder's super hero movies. There is a milestone Batman series that no one can beat. Christopher Nolan's batman series are the milestone. Heath ledger was the best joker and Bale the best batman.", "Continue continue pleaseee": "After watching this movie and seeing what is coming and what snyder is having for us please continue\nDont stop don't change i haven't enjoyed super hero movie so much since so long so please go on with the dcu \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "What a bad product": "I am tired of these kinds of superhero stuff. I am also tired of the path that DC has taken. The story is so immature and makes no sense. Full of unnecessary CGI. Bad acting. Does not get you involved. Too early for those charachters to come up after MoS. Snyder has no taste in camera movment and color. Music was barable. God i am so tired of the fandom, worshiping this like a god. Maybe that is the most they're worth. Do not watch a 4 hour long movie. This means Snyder cannot deliver. Why not make two movies?", "It's awesome comic adaption": "Some story is different from their origin but that's fine", "Zack Snyder may have just saved the franchise": "It's actually quite embarrassing some of the meaningful and epic scenes that were removed from this masterpiece in the theatrical cut. This movie is better than the Theatrical cut in every way. Every character feels meaningful and important and you grow to emotionally connect with all of them because this cut really gives the characters time to connect with their audience instead of making stupid quirky jokes which were present in the previous version of this film. Instead of making a quick short 1 hour 30 minute film. this film gave more of a explanation towards the issue and gave the main antagonist more personality instead of a creepy alien from space who wants to conquer. We are given reason as to why the villain is doing what he is and why it is important for our protagonists to stop him. It feels more epic and more emotionally valuable. Every character seems like they have a reason and a purpose to be in this film. The Flash was one of the characters who was treated like comic relief in the first film but in this film all of his actions are not undermined by silly jokes. He seems like a valuable asset to the team, as does Cyborg who got much more screen time in this movie. The characters are more connectable and the story is more epic. I highly recommend you watch this masterpiece or you would be missing out on something special. #restorethesnyderverse", "Wow amazing!": "I couldn't believe that\nyou can change justice League to this fantastic movie!!!", "A massive revival to the dead Justice League project, but not a saving grace.": "It took all the absolutely TERRIBLE parts of the original Justice League release and did away with it. It made the characters much more fleshed out meanwhile driving the plot further. I have to say I was thoroughly impressed, but not completely captivated. There were many times in this movie that I would ask myself \"Why did they do that?\" Or, \"Why would they say that\". This movie is getting a lot more credit than it should in places that it shouldn't. I think it's just good enough to hang with the juggernauts of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but would definitely not be the best of the bunch. DC you showed great improvement, but you still have some steps to become a revered name in cinema.", "Restore the synderverse": "Great movie but dc,wb,zack synder need to make new movies of Batman,superman,justice league 2 and more so it will be great and also do dubbing of your movies in other languages too specially hindi and do dubbing of this movie too now and make it available on prime india and do same with other future movies of dc .", "Justice League we wanted and Justice League we deserved.": "I was disappointed with Snyder's previous projects in DC like Man of Steel, Batman V Superman and was actually looking forward to what Joss Whedon would bring to DC after his stint at amazing Marvel's Avengers film. But even Joss disappointed me with his version of JL. Thank you DC fandom for this Snyder Cut Justice League campaign. I can't believe a movie that was so pathetic when released turned out to be the best DC film ever, yes this is better than Dark Knight and Wonder Woman. Yes this is the Justice League we wanted. Now I hope we can persuade WB into restoring the Snyderverse. We need to see the Darkseid taking of Justice League.", "Exceeded expectations, even though she was already high!": "I don't usually come here to comment on movies, but I think this is one that deserves this job. Zack Snyder's Justice League is a paradigm shift. Because, just as Marvel created a new model of cinema that many, at first, wrinkled their noses saying that it was not cinema. Thus, Zack did with Zack Snyder's Justice League, creating a new paradigm of how to tell superhero stories. The film is just incredible. I watched it twice to be sure, and the hours fly by. For me, the best movie ever! A true masterpiece! My grade is 10/10, but there is only one criticism: Martian Manhunter's CGI could be better, but I don't think it's fair to impact the grade due to the low budget of the film for CGI.", "Best movie": "I think you should watch this movie because this movie tells as what is ture super hero team movie", "A MOVIE CRAFTED TO PERFECTION.": "All those years of waiting finally paid off.\nSNYDER CUT is the best movie from the DCEU\nThanks to Zack Snyder's vision, what the viewers got was absolutely magical.\n#restorethesnyderverse", "A Labor of Love": "It's obvious to see just how much Zack cares about these characters. Making them real and relatable. Down to earth. This movie is truly has one of the best stories on and off the screen in cinema history. I'm so thankful that I've been able to be part of that. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Mind-blowing, superb and breakthrough": "Zack Snyder presented us with a movie none of us where expecting to be this good. The four hour movie went by in a flash, every single part of it was perfectly created. Each character story and background interlinked in such a brilliant way to capture the interest of all fans, from those who have been immersed in DC world, to those who just watch the films for fun. The real insight behind the mastermind that is Mr. Snyder is in how he created a new plotline within the regular story that was told in the first JL, one that takes this superheroes on an entirely new time-line and plot, I am so looking forward for the next parts, that I am sure by the few things being told online that will give us the best superhero movies of all time, one DC fans deserve and where waiting for. Standing ovation for this masterpiece that will set a new precedent for the future of filmmaking.", "Great movie for a DC fan": "A lot of stuff unseen from the previous JL movie, character development, great fights. It is a little bit long ( 4 hours ) but if you like DC and specially zack Snyder work is worth it. I would recommend it.", "What a movie!": "I loved it, it does not like the previous film, much more in depth. The flash and cyborg finally play an important role. Now is to hope that there will be a continuation.", "Not good": "Disappointed. The theme is so weird. Everything is dark, and it's all about motion capture and bad writing.Come up with something original than trying to force it. It does not work watch mcu they know what they are doing.", "Iconic, masterful": "All DC fans need more of this, because the film leaves you wanting to get a little more history. It would be great to see the continuation of the apocalyptic world.", "We need Zack Snyder's Justice Leauge TWO": "I really would like to see a sequel of this movie with Darkseid as the main villian and Martian Manhunter joining the Justice Leauge.I am so happy that they have the guts and the money to do this movie and admit that it was not fair to prevent us from seeing such beautiful movie with great plot, the storyline has changed drastically in a good way.I like them keeping the dc universe as it is and hire zack snyder for the justice leauge movies.", "100 Times Better than the Original": "Blows the first film completely out of the water. It's four hours but it flies by. Everything that's included in the story is completely necessary and adds so much depth to characters we were introduced to in the first.", "The comeback of DC": "I like Flash, and the way he was portrait in theatrical cut left my heart broken. After all he is one of the most fascinating and powerful DC character. Flash has made a great comeback being a badass speedster. Infact the end game was all upto one and only the Flash.", "Masterpiece, incomparable to the original": "This is the real version of justice league. Where Whedon tried to cut back and land weak humour, Snyder fleshed out story arcs and characters. It also sets up for what could be an amazing Snyderverse. This is a film that begs to be seen in an IMAX cinema, but it's 4 hour runtime makes it perfect for at home watching, with good part divides for breaks. Outstanding", "Amazed": "The hype was real. This movie was an amazing experience, and an amazing film. I could not stress this enough, this movie was 10 times better than the Orginal. And the film was a joy to watch from start to finish. Thank you Snyder! Thank you so much for an amazing film (yes film), this just made me HYPED for DC universe. They NEED to keep this going, Put Snyder in charge!!! He knows what he is doing", "Zack Snyder ruined the movie - thanks but no thanks....": "Great story all good yet the terrible Aspect Ratio ruined the whole film. Sorry it disturbed the viewing pleasure completely. Some media people are just too arrogant. Nearly no one has IMAX so all the artistic arguments are just crap.Otherwise great and incredible movie but THE ASPECT RATIO RUINED THE WHOLE MOVIE.....Hit me with dislikes yet still THE ASPECT RATIO RUINED THE WHOLE MOVIE.....", "You gotta wach it": "I had a little doubt about the 4 hour,but snyder nailed it. You wont feel boared for a single second. Its emotional, amazing,beautifull,thrilling. The 2017JL is nothing compare to this.one of the best 'superhero' movie i've ever watched.just go and watch it...", "An epic movie": "The movie has a great story with an epic battles containing more and more details", "Truly a masterpiece!": "I was worried that I had hyped the movie up too much over the past three and a half years, so much that it could not possible meet my expectations. It certainly met my expectations. At 2.5 hours in, I started getting slightly disappointed because there was only an hour or so left. I didn't want it to end. The only thing that I didn't care for as was that the epilogue felt tacked on and not organically connected to the movie. the Knightmare scenes from BvS were interwoven with the rest of the story and I expected these to be too. However, I am not gonna knock a star off my rating for that. 10/10.", "Story vs. Spectacle... 7.3/10 (Very mild spoilers)": "Ok, first thing's first; this cut is far better than the original. It's more engaging, action packed and epic. I'm glad that Snyder got the opportunity to make it and show us the full potential he can bring to films as epics of the superhero genre.\nThe action is great and interesting, and the narrative flows better in general.\nHowever, whilst this movie is spectacular, it is a bit over baked. Just because Snyder can show us all of this amazing new and forgotten footage doesn't mean he should. Some scenes are just too overdrawn and some characters almost have no real place in the film. Why did the Steppenwolf horse chase scene have to be that long? He jumped like, 20 times or something? How about the Barry Allen pet store scene? Come on, we know what the flash can do and see plenty of this later on. And why the whole 'Superman forgets stuff' part? These scenes don't particularly serve the plot and they are also the only place for characters such as Lois Lane, the Amazons and Mira to have a place in the film. Then again some of these subplots and ideas are interesting (Victor's whole backstory and his Dad's part in the film are great) but should still be condensed anyway.\nVFX are good, some are iffy but considering the circumstances it's not a problem for me. Soundtrack is great and I love the revisions of Zimmer's epic score for Man of Steel in certain parts.\nSo whilst I definitely enjoyed seeing the potential of a mega sized superhero group film, it does have to be done well and have enough of a main story to really work. Even so, Snyder's film was an enjoyable and original watch nonetheless.", "Ya'll owe me an apology :P": "There was a time I had to take so much flag for sticking with Snyder on this arguably silly and flawed mess of a franchise despite practically everyone hating on him.Now tell me again how this is not a million times better!!??I could have done without the singing tho and there is one or two sequences I actually prefer in the theatrical release but this is factually the better version and at least its consistent with the previous 2.", "It just wouldn't end": "I'll make it short. It IS better than Whedon's film but then the first Justice League was a real mess so most people would have made a better movie than that.But is it a good movie? No. It is endlessly long and still doesn't manage to tell a engaging story or make us feel for the characters. There is more of Cyborg which wasn't bad but also I didn't much care. For fans of the Flash there are some nods to the show but since I did not watch it I could only acknowledge that there was something for the fans and move on. Still both of the side-characters outshone the four supers, that's how uninteresting it all was. There were no surprises, no wow-moments. Maybe Marvel spoiled us with too many good movies and great stories, but this just did not move me, at all.Also, the music, good grief, I love the Amazons but the theme is not very good and it is used WAY too often, it's really annoying.The sequence at the end did not need to be there, that could have easily been the start of the next movie, it felt really disjointed and kind of overdramatized.All in all, I'm disappointed, after all the hype it was just a very long and draining experience I could have done without. I'll probably delete this from my mind like its predecessor.", "Masterful": "I cannot believe this is the same movie. Absolutely fantastic. The DCEU LIVES!", "Aka \"We Believe in Fist Bumps\"": "Nice attempt and good intentions. The CGI in the modern era, just keeps evolving; which is great for certain FX. Yet, it leaves Human characters empty and without weight. Feels like watching a video game.The music is terrible all around, if it's not wailing choral cheesiness, it's alternative pop songs in place of original material. Also, the cliche orchestra stuff is boring.Amber Heard chews up the scenery like a university student trying to impress a local reporter who came to see the show. as Lex Luther is just just ridiculous as a teenager going to work and posing as his father. Jared Leto = One year ahead of Ms. Heard at the University.* No jokes work. Batman sunglasses are dumb looking.Lastly the bat signal looks like mashed potatoes ;)", "This is what the DCEU is supposed to be!": "Thanks Mr Snyder for giving us the JL movie we deserve, the JL movie we need. Great movie that DC fans will love. All the actors are a great fit to the characters. Warner Brothers get your head out of your a** and let Zack give us the Snyderverse, it will make you a boatload of money. I loved everything about this movie. The only thing I could possibly say, I wanted Martian Manhuntet to join the fight and to see a Green Lantern join the fight. But I am content to wait for JL 2 for that.", "A complete worth for your extra time!": "Long story short the movie is what every DC fan needs.

This is the movie that we all deserved to watch from the beginning. It has everything the theatrical version hasn't, like characters development, specially in the case of Cyborg and Flash. Flash is not that ridiculous version we saw anymore, the one that was only there to make jokes, he is still the comic guy but now he has a very important role just like Cyborg, they got the place they deserved. In the case of Steppenwolf he has a much better physical aspect and now we know why he comes to Earth and what are his motivations. All the action sequences shown in the theatrical version are improved a 100% in this version. It simply has all what we wanted from the beginning, a good story well developed with a lot of action.", "Hail Snyder": "I dont remember a single scene in the movie I havnt got goosebumps at. If anything Justice League deserved that was Snyder as the director.", "Considering the budget, possibly the greatest miscarriage of cinema in decades": "I went in with the lowest expectations I could muster, and it still managed to disappoint in ways I'd never even conceived were possible. It actually educated me in cinematography by butchering the execution of things I'd previously taken for granted in movies. I can't believe so many famous and successful people gave this their blessing. The CGI, acting, writing, dialogue, macro pacing, micro pacing, color palatte, feeling of movement of characters, consistency of universe rules, character motivations, exposition, action scenes - I literally do not have vocabulary to even describe everything they failed abyssmally at. This could be better executed by a team of 12 year olds if you gave them the budget.", "4:3 make me feel disappointed": "No smart TV or LCD Screen has ratio 4:3 for this film.\nSo it makes my eyes disappointed during whole of the time.\nContent is better than before a lot\nI like Ben\nBut 4:3 is not acceptable.", "Don't fall for the negative reviews, they're review-bombings by bots, Worth the hype, Solid movie": "Man, if this movie was released back in 2017, DCEU would have been established pretty solidly. All of the scenes were completed by Snyder, except the epilogue. WB easily could have made that possible with help in post production. Reshoots were not necessary. It has already balanced humour, but what Whedon installed is unbalanced chunk of cringe humour.This is how you do an ensemble Superhero movie, without having solo movies for 3 of the heroes, with giving time to their character development and then hope for a sequel or prequel where we get the full picture of their origins. Cyborg's origin is pretty clear here, we got hints about Aquaman and Flash. The theme about families is very touching and gets you emotional, especially Cyborg's. Steppenwolf has a solid reason yo attack earth now, his motives are well established. Motherboxes and their functioning explained in details, the history lesson war was epic, really epic, 100 times better than Whedon's. And the dialogues and bgm are spot on. Knightmare scene bound to give you goosebumps. That's all I can say. It's a must watch. It's totally in par with Infinity War and Endgame, and better than Avengers and Age of Ultron and many other MCU movies. But Watchmen is still the best superhero assemble (also Snyder's) movie for me.", "Well ...": "I couldn't get passed 10min of the 2017 one. I can handle this a bit longer.

Everyone else was on point exept Bruce in one scene (No Spoiling)\nCinematography : Zack Snyder Unleashed himself fully without caring about criticism , slow-mo's are super , the shift of focus and dynamic angles are also very much 'Trademark Snyder'\nMusic : In the beginning the score doesn't feel catchy at all , the brilliance starts after you hear the first extended WW score . There are also some quieter scenes for intense dialogues to take place . In the end the movie merges with the score .Would it work in Theatres : As a 3.5 hour cut , the answer is yes , if you watched that other 3 hour long movie , this isn't much different .Character Development : Ray Fisher Shines with his amusing range . Barry Allen is Barry Allen , Bruce Wayne is Bruce Wayne and Batman is constantly evolving , Diana However is back from the first WW Movie , Superman once again has a tough time being an outcast but now he knows that he means something and finds his peace .Voice Acting : Darkseid , Steppenwolf and Desaad were \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 .What Does the movie Prove :\n1) Zack was perfect for DC and uniquely different .2) Jared Leto was not a bad choice for JOKER .3) We can introduce multiple characters in a movie by reducing the involvement of previously established characters .4) Ray Fisher has Range .5) The superhero genre needs something new .6) Critics often get used to watching one thing constantly and they become solid against new things .7) Studios like WB can fall .8) Fans are better than Haters and the studios should focus on it .9) Last but not the Least : The Remaining Snyderverse has to be protected even if it cannot be restored to former glory as it is a modern piece of art .", "A joyful surprise": "I love DC comics, but their movies leave a lot to be desired.

Although, there are quite a few removed scenes and dialogs that should've been kept, they add interesting interactions and explanations.Weird the 4/3 format (in black and white is a no-go). And the childish, Marvel-like jokes break the mood and the solemn atmosphere. Luckily, there are few of them.Steppenwolf deserves his own movie.Photography, music, slow motion, solemnity, darkness... Pure epic Zack Snyder. It's clear that there will be a sequel.Still, nothing gets more Zack Snyder than Sucker Punch. Please, a second part for Sucker Punch!", "They cut/removed/reshoot this film, and branded as unwatchable ?": "They cut/removed/reshoot this film ! unbelievable its a masterpiece on this circumstance (where super-hero's haven't any solo films to show their origin). well its four hours some scene felt unneeded but you don't feel that you waste your time . thumps up.", "From a Non bias POV - Best Superhero film of all time.": "This has EVERYTHING you'd want in a DC Justice League.

I'm glad it was 4 hours and I was able to watch from home (4k 5.1) but would be hard if it was in theaters, could easily be made in 2 parts.\nI hope they continue the story and make it even more epic!!", "Good work Snyder!!!": "Watch justice league 2017, in Justice league 2021. Thanks Snyder!", "From someone who loved Justice League Animated Cartoons..": "To be honest, I didn't even know what to expect, I hated the theatrical 2017 version of this movie. I am NOT a hardcore DC fan but as a kid who grew up watching each episode of \"Justice League Unlimited\" on Cartoon Network (which I still think is the best cartoon series to date). Supes and Bats are my favorite heroes, JL cartoon had a big influence on my childhood.\nThe movie begins with the ending scene of BvS, emphasizing Lex Luthor's line \"The bells are already been rung, and they've heard it. Out in the dark, among the stars, the God is dead.\"\nWith Superman's scream being the bell that awakes the mother box (these boxes have spirits and they are alive.) Batman after comprehending Lex's word springs to build the team, each member of the league gets a proper character development.Things I Loved: I admired the Cinematography, in-spite of being a director, Zack Snyder had an innate talent for photography, each scene is beautiful with Snyder's signature style of numerous slow-mo shots and dark color palette. If taken screenshots, each frame can be an exquisite wallpaper. The fight scenes are well-choreographed, I saw them with my friends, and we tasted literal goosebumps at action sequences. Every choice the team takes is making sense here, the decisions were logical and teamwork is manifested, each scene is linked to the upcoming scenes. The stuff that felt random in the theatrical cut, makes absolute sense here. (Why in the world, Joss Whedon removed those scenes.) The CGI looks better, especially relieved by the fact that there's no CGI mustache on Superman. The character development was done right, Cyborg and Flash steal the show, they felt like the main stars of this Snyder cut.Things I didn't like:\nIt's an awesome movie, but it has many problems, there are some pacing issues, JunkieXL's musical score was good at some point, as well as it feels uncanny at some. But in the budget they have, I don't think they could've hired Hans Zimmer for music ( He worked on BvS and MoS musical score), The movie feels slow at some point and the optional scenes are not excluded due to no restrictions of runtime.\nI was disappointed by the fact that there were no reshoots from characters like Henry Cavill (Superman), the movie is made from all the footage Zack caught in the year 2016-2017. He made this movie amidst the pandemic with editing and stuffs, in fact, I noticed the scene where Superman was mourning Lois's death with Darkseid standing right behind him is the same scene taken from \"Man of Steel\" (2013) movie.As for the story, it's unfinished, we're left with a cliffhanger, I loved the injustice nightmare scenes and Cyborg's visions, We're left to imagine Lois died with a child in her womb, Darkseid found the anti-life equation, and using anti-life he manipulated Superman and hence the story of injustice timeline, Joker lines adds up to that fact that they tried time travel with Flash but Bruce failed so far. If the sequel is made, the story is potentially going to be epic. The movie is made for the existing DC fans, as for the general audience, they might not understand stuff like the spirits of the mother boxes, The anti-life equation, the speed force, the nightmare timeline or Uxas (young Darkseid), etcFinal verdict: This movie adds its name to one of the best superhero movies of all time, with limited resources and footage, we get what we deserve.Score: 4.5/5", "The greatest superhero movie!!!": "ZSJL is really nice, i wasn't seen any movie like it!!", "Seriously, a star for every tedious hour of watching": "The quick and dirty review: don't waste your time. Now the somewhat longer review. I like superhero movies. All of them. Even found the Fantastic Four watchable. But this rehash of the first iteration is stil missing real feelings and deep emotions. Superman being resurrected starts a fight instantly but stops when he meets his girlfriend. Really? That brought back his memory and emotions? Yeah right. And that snassy new Superman uniform all dark and black. Much better. Another hero, take the Flash... we are being treated to a weird scene where he saves a girl from having a carcrash and pets the dogs almost all at the same thing getting him a job. That is some savvy character building. That scene made me all warm and fuzzy about the Flash. I already thought he had a job being a csi dude, yes rather would have seen the TV series Flash made an appearance in this flick. I love Ezra but not as the Flash. TV Flash has feelings and would have brought a world of emotions. So much that you didn't need to stich in this complete useless scene. Steppenwolf! What a character. Why give these 3 boxes to his idiot boss? Claim that power and kill everyone including the Reidseed or whatever that dude is being called. As one demon to another double crossing comes with the job, no? One other thing. Can someone tell my these mystery boxes are worth saving? Apparently they where so dangerous people had to watch them 24/7. Is humans at least tried to disappear the box. And why not bury these boxes 10 km deep in mineshafts and pour concrete on them instead of 3 shovels deep or as the more advanced Amazones and Atlantians did. Put them high on displaying them to the world! On pedestals with 100 warriors watching the box instead of watching the enemy coming from afar. I'm not a screenwriter but seriously I could have delivered a more real scenario than this waste of money and 4 hours! Of propping up an already 5 star movie. 4 hours of wasting peoples time... 4 stars at most.", "Could've been shorter": "Just one comment, it could've been much shorter without affecting the blot, the director was stubborn to change his vision while he could've achieve it in line with the production vision.", "A lot of it did not feel right, but it offers some closure.": "Given that I'm one of a tiny minority of people that loved Batman V Superman, I had high hopes for Justice League way, way back. The first time it came out I was beyond disappointed; but I hoped that this new version would address many of those issues.Unfortunately, I still feel like everything about Superman coming back felt rushed and partly nonsensical, and that's not okay when you have a runtime of 4h. They decide to resurrect Superman in what should be a moment of crisis, but then no one is mad when he goes nuts and nearly kills them? And Batman just has \"faith\" that he'll show up at the right moment?The whole thing between them is entirely unearned, by the way. It's made explicitly clear in BvS that the entire reason Bruce feels he has to take Superman down is because he is far too powerful to be trusted. He has a VISION OF A HELLWORLD that comes to pass due to Superman going evil, but somehow he does a 180 and now thinks Superman has to be trusted no matter what. But why? It makes no sense. It genuinely does not. Why would he suddenly forgive Superman for the death of thousands of people during the battle with Zod? Are we to assume that Bruce is so mentally unstable that he couldn't see things straight before but now he's seen the light, despite acting irrationally?I am sure Batman would have chosen to resurrect Superman no matter what if he thought that was the only way to save the world. But to show no negative reaction to Superman NEARLY KILLING him as well as Barry? To never once have a scene by himself where he considers, at least for five seconds, \"What do we do if he does go evil? What do we do if he doesn't show up?\" Nothing? Seriously?Batman is basically the idiot. No, Bruce's superpower is not \"being rich\" it's being prepared. It's having a plan. It's detaching himself emotionally when necessary to make the right call. In what world would trusting a god that's likely to destroy the multiverse if his fragile and mortal love interest dies count as reasonable? It is not. NOTHING has changed in the relationship of these two from the beginning of BvS to now. Absolutely nothing. Again, Batman wanted to kill Superman because he thought nobody stays good. Except that NOW (after being attacked and seeing visions), he knows for a fact Superman doesn't. But still he becomes a quasi-cultist and entrusts to fate of the world to Superman anyway, without any plan to deal with him later? Without any misgivings and doubts? Without any backup plan?I'm sorry, but that just doesn't make sense. Sure, you could have a story where Batman finds redemption through Superman's death. Absolutely, you could. BUT THEN DON'T MAKE THE ENTIRE STORY REVOLVE AROUND SUPERMAN GOING EVIL WHEN LOIS DIES. WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, THE ENTIRE MOTIVATION OF BATMAN NOT TRUSTING SUPERMAN IN BVS WHICH WAS PROVEN RIGHT BEFORE HIS EYES.Very frustrating with Mr. Snyder as always. Sometimes he gets things so right; but other times he just gets them oh so wrong.As for the rest of the movie, I'm not sure how I feel. Seeing Amazons fighting Steppenwolf was great. That whole sequence from them jumping all over him to him chasing them down was amazing. But everything revolving around Aquaman was just unpleasant and unwelcome. Amber Heard's accent is so fake and posh that she's trying to make the LotR cast sounds like peasants. Flash and Cyborg were nice, but I also the movie would've been stronger had they just not been a part of it. I would definitely trade them to have Steppenwolf fleshed out considerably more, as well as Darkseid.Ultimately, it was trying to do way too much at once, even for a runtime this long. And yet some scenes - like having Superman walk around the ship hearing his two dads again while choosing his suit - were needless We're already been there, and this isn't even his movie. Fan service does not make a story better.Batman v Superman is certainly a superior, and far more interesting story.", "Pure adrenaline rush": "I am actually blown away by how amazing this film is. High energy right away and the momentum never lets up. It left me wanting more. Can't wait for the sequel", "Zack Snyder JLA review": "The making of this movie is a documentary unto itself. The timing of HBO Max dropping and the fans demanding the release of Snyder original vision was all perfect timing. I really enjoyed this movie as a lifelong comic book fan I adore DC comics universe. This was a completely different movie from the theatrical release in 2017. The plot is the same but the story is more fleshed out. For four hours the film gives the characters breathing room and everyone gets a chance to shine. Hopefully Snyder can continue this story on HBO Max. The format he used for the movie worked especially breaking it down by chapters. I can see him doing very well on the streaming service as this gives him room to tell a complete a story without having to edit much out the film. I believe that's one reason his theatrical release of BVS flopped they removed 30 minutes from the film but that 30 min was integral to which threw off the pacing and story as a whole. I hope for more out of this universe but only time will tell but I'm happy to say there is a good Justice League movie out there. It was well worth it.", ".": "Hi I am not replying back from the back of the holiday I just saw your mail.", "Glad I never saw Justice League 2017": "It is a great movie for all the visual effects and punching/action scenes.\nNobody is better at doing action scenes than the guy behind 300. :D\nI strongly suggest to not watch the entire movie in one shot.\nTake a break after one hour of screenplay.\nIt is made more like a TV series mixed in 4hours + divised in chapters.\nThat said it is the Justice League story all DC fans know. No big surprise here.\nThe way it is made and cut truly make it great.\nAll those heroes working together is always a pleasure to see but the supposed funny parts are not funny. Marvel has the edge for the funny scenes making their movies even better because of that. You cannot have it all. DC has the great action scenes. Marvel the great punch lines and timing to have a great time with the characters dialogues.", "FOR THE FANS!": "This movie is definitely better the 2017 version! this movie delivers in many ways with either characters or action pieces. Throughout the film we get very well informed with each character and their internal emotions which gets you connected in a way with a character. This movie is definitely to be watched in one day!", "This the real Justice League and true sequel to MoS & BvS.": "After years of debate and twitter hashtags THE SNYDER CUT is here.Zack Snyder's Justice League is the film we should've gotten back in 2017. All the drama aside, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a far better film than the theatrical version. Some would argue it's the same film and in some ways it is. The difference is in the execution and the consistency of tone introduced in Snyder's previous films.Snyder made this film with love while the Wheadon cut (2017) was clearly a studio mandate film for executives to collect bonuses.With a 4 hour run time the film is long. The first two hours are a bit on the slower side but we learn a lot about the characters. There are less jokes and the performances overall are better than the forced reshoots in the Wheadon cut. We learn more about the villains and what they're actually trying to do making the story and plot a lot more clear than the muddy theatrical version.It all builds to the resurrection of Superman and when it does you really feel it where in the theatrical version it felt rushed and forced. The return of Superman feels truly earned in this version.Cyborg was the heart of the film and The Flash is an actual character who greatly contributes to the team where in the theatrical version was turned into a joke who can't handle himself. He has an incredible scene at the end.Some would call this film bloated and over stuffed. Is it? It's a lot of stuff but this was Zack Snyder giving us his original vision. He pulled no punches. Some scenes were unnecessary but this was Zack giving us everything he had due to the chances of a sequel being slim. Could it have been cut down? Sure. But in this case there was no need to. Snyder got to make the piece of art he wanted to.I'm thrilled for Zack and fans to finally get the film we were promised almost four years ago. In my opinion everything in the Snyder cut is better.", "Lets all agree to act like the first one never happened": "This is the justice league movie we were waiting for. So glad Zack Snyder got to see his vision realized.", "A Bold, Beautiful & Brilliant Film": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is, simply put, an absolute brilliant film. The pacing, action, acting, cinematography/visuals, and score are all top notch. While the 4-hour runtime may at first seem daunting to take on, the film actually moves along in a way that feels more like a 2 1/2-hour movie. This is a beautiful testament to Snyder using every bit of that time to masterfully build the story & character arcs in a way that feels entirely earned.A few spoiler-free thoughts/standouts:1. The Action: Phenomenal action! It's nothing short of thrilling, to say the least. The action all throughout this film was a huge standout & all perfectly shot by Zack Snyder.2: Wonder Woman: In my opinion, this movie was hands down the BEST portrayal of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman so far. She's strong, empowering, inspiring, and downright the warrior we know & want her to be. She fits into this film so well & Gadot's performance is top notch.3. Cinematography: The cinematography & visuals could not be better! This is an absolutely gorgeous film with exceptional CGI. Snyder did a phenomenal job of making every single shot in this movie look incredible.4: The Score: Wow! Tom Holkenborg took on a tremendous task of composing nearly 4 hours of music for this movie & it absolutely does not go unnoticed. I would even go as far to say that the music in this IS a character that supplements the story and visuals perfectly. It is such a beautiful score.Verdict: As I said in my title, this is a bold, beautiful & brilliant film that is 100% worth the wait and worth watching. In my opinion, this is the best DCEU movie & is honestly now one of my favorite films as well. 10 out of 10.", "This chicken came before the egg (a realistic review)": "Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a fan of Snyder and I'm glad he was given the opportunity to undo Jock Whedon's studio cut. I always know when I sit down to watch a Snyder film that I'm going to get a 7 or an 8, and it's going to be a fun 2+ hours (300 is probably a 9 and Watchmen is criminally underrated).Anyway, with that out of the way, let's avoid a fan-boy review and briefly summarise why this film is only rated 8.5 (at the time of writing) because it's being compared to the original, which was sabotaged by a guy who considers Mein Kampf a self-help book.The good:\n. Improved special effects\n. Added context which gives more of a \"why\" to the main narrative, and makes you feel like the boxes aren't just random macguffins that exist because the junior script guy blurted it out\n. Added scenes with a certain character that actually bring genuine humour to the film (can't believe DC finally managed to achieve this)\n. Added certain characters to add weight to the DC universe and actually make it seem like there's a bigger (cosmic) picture going on behind the scenes\n. Longer running time (4 hours) which I absolutely loved. I hope we see more of this going forwards.\n. A consistent tone with appropriate cinematographyThe bad:\nThere's only one major problem with the film but it's so major that it unfortunately undermines a huge part of it.This film tries so so so hard to create emotional pay-offs with characters that... we just don't care about. And why would we? Justice League was always going to have this problem because DC rushed it through fear of being left behind by Marvel (which they have been). Why would we care about Ezra's the Flash when we haven't seen him before? Why would we care about Cyborg when we haven't seen him before? Why would we care about Ben's Batman when our only experience of him was the abomination that is Batman vs Superman? The film makes so many bizarre attempts to invoke emotion from us with scenes of \"the team\" together as though we should have any type of emotion for them. We never got to see the egg hatch and grow into a chicken. Instead, a chicken has been thrown at us and we're supposed to be emotionally invested in it instead of simply throwing it in the frying pan and enjoying a decent meal. Sorry, but no. Marvel's Endgame isn't a 9 or a 10 because it has great special effects, it's a 9 or a 10 because we were introduced to the characters over time and the emotional pay-offs at the end were amazing (backed up by great special effects).In summary, Snyder manages to add a few cool scenes to the film and the special effects are better, but the underlying issue with the film remains the same; there's no reason to care about a \"team\" of characters we've never seen before. A good film with lots of fun action scenes and well worth 4 hours, but that's all you should expect; fun.", "Great Movie. Must see": "What a great Movie. Absolutely best of the best.

And the Joker being there but no Martin, no Wonder Woman to be seen in the ending is quiet strange and really got you thinking so many things. I really do hope they make another sequel to this better improved Justice League, at least from what I seen Zack has moved onto other series but if this movie does make the money needed. Zack will most likely keep the sequel going, not make other movies of the characters, but of the whole full sequel, I say after the new one comes out, a year before it's out Zack will most likely make his decision than about his sequel. But really, where the hell is Wonder Woman, the world?", "That's How You Make a Superhero Movie": "That's what happen when u give a Director freedom to create his vision, Snyder Cut is a live example.

He's very expresive. Plus, now he's somewhat interesting.\nMost of the added scenes are great, with a few exceptions, and scenes we saw before are greatly improved, specially the final battle.\nThe color grading doesn't make me want to vomit anymore, so that's nice.\nFlash is still annoying, but less so, you take him seriously when he isn't being the comic relief (Except for his first scene, it is so weird with that song in the background).\nThe acting is very cheesy, and sometimes it works, but sometimes is just awkard.\nThe ending is such a tease, there's no way the fans aren't going to annoy WB to death until they let him do the follow up, and I'm up for it, looks like it could be a fascinating movie.All in all, it's the best I could hope for: Coherent, fun, with those Zack Snyder moments that make great YT videos, and watchable.", "Worth the Hype!": "Snyder's cut is the true vision of the DCEU.

I think some scenes weren't really necessary/didn't add value and could've been cut without issue. Some scenes were definitely longer than they needed to be.There was so much hype around this movie before it was even released, and there is a whole community of die-hard fanatics that will criticize anyone who doesn't absolutely love the movie, and I think this most definitely has contributed to the success of the movie. Because the movie alone, still wasn't as great as the hype. I support Snyder, understand the issues with Whedon, and so on.

Huge fan of him as Batman but I love them all. They are all PERFECT. That goes for the baddies as well. Steppenwolf and Darkseid were incredible. Please #RestoreTheSnyderverse and give us #Batfleckmovie. Zack Snyder does us all justice with his vision and WE NEED MORE!", "Thank you Snyder....": "Really satisfied with the movie. It has got everything a superhero movie requires. Don't miss this masterpiece..", "An epic superhero adventure in a large scale": "Far far far better than justice league (2017),,\nZack Snyder's justice league is a perfect combination of beautiful story, excellent story telling, excellent performance of actors, awesome cinematography, vfx and CGI,\nWhen I heard this movie is of 4 hours i though what they would actually show in the movie because 2017's justice league was of almost 2 hours,, after watching snyder cut I'm thinking what they actually showed in justice league (2017).", "Amazing conclusion to DCEU.": "I loved it. This was pure fan service and I enjoyed it. 4 hours went by really fast. All the characters got their arc completed and got a fair amount of screen time. Nothing felt rushed or left out. Amazing action sequences, and well-written dialogues. I would definitely like to see more of this universe by Zack Snyder. This is the way, the DCEU way.\nWhat an amazing conclusion to Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.", "This is what you call a super hero movie": "Just one word describes this movie - fantastic.Very well put together, a good story, great plot, very well shot and amazing action scenes.", "Like an outstanding art film about superheroes": "What Zack Snyder did with this movie is nothing short of awe-inspiring. I saw the original theatrical release and remember leaving feeling like it was ok, but ultimately pretty fluffy. A lot of stuff didn't really track with the comics, the motivations of the characters were a bit lacking, and it all just seemed like a vehicle to get the DC heroes together on screen and make a poor man's Avengers. I also remember feeling like the other heroes were basically pointless as soon as Superman showed up to the fight, because they didn't really seem able to hold their own in any way.Enter Zack Snyder's vision of what the movie was always supposed to be. Characters suddenly have backstories and motivations. The events fit into a larger multiverse and begin to tie together in a way that makes this team feel necessary. And the heroes aren't all a bunch of underpowered weaklings next to Superman anymore; they're actually a team.Snyder's fingerprints are all over the film in great ways, and his use of slow motion, though fairly ubiquitous, helps make the movie feel just so beautiful. It's obvious that the film was meant to tie into a larger, ongoing franchise, and one only hopes that this experiment proves so wildly successful that the studios turn control of the DCU back over to Snyder.At 4 hours, this is a VERY long movie. But, it is broken into chapters. I found these excellent points to break, go do something else, and come back - much like binge watching an episodic TV show. If you haven't yet, do yourself the favor of checking out this movie, rewarding the studio for their gamble and voting for better content like this with your subscription dollars. You will not regret it.", "Justice League a film with heart but no soul": "Let\u00b4s get one thing out of the way, The Snyder Cut is a much better and cohesive movie than its predecessor.It still tells the same story but this time (almost) everything fits quite nicely together.If your not a Zack Snyder fan, this will just be another super hero movie, with lots of entertainment and a so-so story.With a run time clocking 4hours, if this is the story that went to hell to be raised from the ashes, it\u00b4s just okay. It\u00b4s a good movie, it\u00b4s not the master piece fans have been \"reviewing\", it\u00b4s not bad by all means it\u00b4s just a \"good movie\".If you\u00b4d cut the padding, the 5 minutes singing, some of the unecessary slow motions, the fan service that doesnt even serve this story, you could have a 3h movie.For all the action and revelations, the film still suffers from the same problems as the previous Snyder movies. The story telling is mediocre as are the dialogues.Being the 1\u00bas movie where we are introduced to several characters doesnt help either. The characters and their relations feel empty. They have this sense of unity but when you really think about it they barely know each other. Still there is this sense of duty towards a frienship, when batman really just spent a couple of hours with superman before he died. When Clark is finally with Lois, the characters say the right things but I feel I barely know them, there is this sense of strangeness. It\u00b4s like when a movie tells you the characters are best friends but it is never actually shown that to you, so when you see them together, you dont feel it. Of all the characters Cyborg is the only one who is fleshed out, whose personal story and character arc are seeded within the overall story, while the others are like, just there. Look I get it, the flash runs in order to save the world, finding his place in it and reedeming himself and his father by doing so. Aquaman has a gripe with his mother for abandoning him but not much is revealed beyond that. I mean I know this is not Schindler\u00b4s List but for 4 hours, it\u00b4s just to thin.It\u00b4s funny how a movie called Justice League automatically makes its title obsolete by the time superman steps in.The cinematography in general is great, some of the added scenes, not so good but it\u00b4s understandable.Anyway if you have 4 hours to dedicate or you just want to get it over with, maybe you should watch this movie.", "A major win for not only fans but filmmakers everywhere": "It's inevitable that's haters will flood the ratings without even seeing the movie or giving it attention for the sake of brand loyalty. My question to them is: why be childish? Enjoy this for what it is and that's love a director's love for these characters and wanted to display his vision to the world. This was a redemption arc for Snyder aswell the heroes. The movie may not be perfect with pacing, but it is what it is. Especially considering it was edited during a global pandemic with a small budget. If whedon used 10% of original footage, then Snyder used 90% less of the theatrical cut - which we can all agree is a good thing. The movie left me with a feeling of fulfilment and joy, and angry that I was robbed of the IMAX experience. I couldn't ask for more. There's also small f u's to the studio in this (letos cameo and batflecks batman setup. Snyder showing the studio execs that you'll never get these things). This movie left me saying wow/holy s**** at most of the action sequences especially Batman and flashes. He truly is a genius when it comes to combat cinema. I realised half way that everyone compares the final fight in infinity war to lord of the rings. A comparison to Zack Snyder's 300 would be a more fitting comparison to the final sequence in this movie. As someone who grew up watching the old JL cartoons (and new) I'm more than happy with this. It was a great story introducing us to the world of all these heroes, all drifting through alone and then finding meaning together. Drifting like Clark was at the beginning of Mos before his father guided him. Watching this k don't understand whedons decision at all to cut the scenes he did and reshoot, but it just shows the difference in film making between him and Snyder. I would give this movie an 8 but the reasons it scores a 9 are as follows; this will now give filmmakers power over the studio and if tragedy had not occured to the Snyder family I believe he would have had time and budget to fix the pacing issues and do reshoots where required. Overall A fantastic end to his trilogy", "It's a masterpiece": "It's the best superhero movies of the world only The Dark Knight can compite with this movie, it's wonderful to finally see this movie", "A great movie!

This is a review of a long-time Marvel fan, who was hoping to start liking the DC, but this film has let her down.\"Finally, the Snyder Cut! The superhero universe of DC is saved!\", the whole world sighed with relief. Then something went wrong.\nTo put it shortly, it is a 4-hour cheap-looking-CGI-filled hot mess with comic book characters that do not seem psyched to hang out with each other.\nWriting? Unnecessarily long-winded, confusing and very far from exciting.\nScore? Tone-deaf (pun intended) to the pacing of the film and constantly repeating on a loop. You'll be shocked, but the WW theme really does not grow on you in 4 hours, it just gets annoying.\nCinematography? Trying so hard to be epic that it's not epic anymore. Could there be any more slow motion sequences? I don't think that's physically possible. Plus, as mentioned before, the CGI is surprisingly lousy. The black and white version, though, might save the situation a bit.\nActing? Pretty mediocre performances, while having top-notch movie stars.\nAn honorable mention here should be Flash as a primary comedic relief of the movie, which hadn't relieved anything. Now, I love Ezra Miller and I think he could do better with better writing (this can be applied to everything else in JL).Conclusion? I'm hoping to be able to enjoy the DCU as much as I love MCU. I hope to see some character chemistry on screen, well-crafted computer graphics and the realized potential of the dark nature of DC.\nKeep up trying to keep up the good work, DC!

Finally after 13 years the dark knight is defeated as the best dc movie and also the superhero movie by this. That's how good it is. Ben Afflecks Batman and Henry cavills Superman's character arcs flow fluently from the last time we saw them in Batman v Superman, Jason momoa Aquamans story ties into his standalone film way better than the theatrical cut of the movie,gal gadot as wonder woman is perfect as always, the villain Steppenwolf looks more intimidating and feels more like a villain than a negative character from the powerpuff girls like he was in justice league 2017. Well the mvps were none other than Ezra Miller as flash and Ray fisher as cyborg who's journeys have upgraded tenfolds from the dumb theatrical cut of the movie and of course the hero of this movie who deserves most of the credit is none other than the legend himself zack Snyder who made this fulfilling journey possible #restorethesnyderverse wud live to see zack Snyder complete his story that he planned.", "Amazing and wonderful": "It is an amazing movie.

But I saw a lot of Super Hero Pics and I do love Chris Nolan\"s Batman movies AND even the long \"ultimate edition\" of Batman vs. Superman.This one here I s a pic for fans no doubt, maybe only for fans ? Who else could stay 4h of CGI overload without being finally bored by endless fights, flying Aliens AND some totally meaningless and long Soap Opera scenes (Superman reunited with his mum and Lois at his home) ?Cinematography is really great, the Snyder style is special and I\"m well with that - it's his own recognizable brand.But I hate the pointless 4:3 format. You can see in so many scenes that the original shot was cut on the left and right. Zack voluntarily amputated the pi the c ! What a pity for a theatrical feeling ! TVs are large nowadays, but anyway...what a bad decision!Dialogue is mostly stupid when it comes to \"scientific\" explanations. But of course this is the comic world we have to accept - you have to be ready to switch your brain off and to \"live\" in this dreamworld. If you can't , this is not for you and you are not going to like it.All in all the new cut can't save the weak original story which reminds everyone the Avenger's Infinity Stones storyline in far too many aspects. Is there really nothing else in the comic world as to put some pieces together to reign over the galaxy ? If this is the praised \"masterpiece\" for so many people then we all have to say goodbye to nearly 100years of movie culture.Don't get me a wrong: It's a very well-made movie which looks extremely expensive and I admit that I also felt entertained in a way - but for me it's too much of everything here...", "A lot better then the last one": "Over all I'm happy to see this finally get done and I think the extra run time is what made it work along with the direction of Snyder himself.

This is a solid 8+ and has nothing to feel ashamed about at all standing next to Avengers movies, unlike the theatrical version. Basically it went from \"meh\" to \"gimme the damn sequel.\"All this 10/10 spam you see in the reviews is a bit over the top, typical fanboy stuff where everything is either 1/10 or 10/10.

The pacing and harmonious arcs played in such a way I actually enjoyed it. This time there were goose bumps because the pieces came together with purpose.All this time, I had assumed that Snyder was to blame for the aimless dumpster fire of a movie that was Justice League's theatrical cut. And I was wrong...soo wrong. This movie took on multiple protagonists that had yet to be explored and offered skin-tingling vignettes that ultimately changed the perspective/tone of the entire story. This is why the 4 hour runtime was so crucial. And yes, it's a whole lot more than the theatrical cut; however, as mentioned above, it created much-needed space to let the viewers think and engage with the film. And by the end, it appears we've stumbled upon something greater. We've taken a glimpse into a thought-provoking saga that will seemingly explore fate's belonging to the fabric of time.As Snyder lays the seeds, you see his vision that extends beyond one movie into a multi-dimensional story of epic proportions. Suppose he's able to continue this journey. In that case, I expect we'll remember this not as the #SnyderCut but the first installment of the #SnyderSaga.I'm hoping this is not the end but the beginning...", "An Absolute Masterpiece!": "Amazing!

And I am now at peace and satisfied with zacks unfortunate shortened DC extended universe. I can only hope Warner bros. Will find it within theirselves to finish zacks 5 movie story arc.", "Does it come in black ?": "Four years later, Zack Snyder's Director's cut Justice League is hitting the small screen. In order to finish his version, Snyder did several reshoots and was privileged with knowledge of the shortcoming of the previous version and the feedbacks from critics and fans. On top of that, he was freeer in term of deadline and film duration. Final result is a movie more in line with previous DC Extended Universe movies and the Director's vision and style. It feels that more respect has been paid to the characters and the original work. A boon for the fans, but the work has its flaws and reveals the director's own shortcomings.First thing first, the movie is way too lengthy (4 hours !). For finish it, I needed to divide it into two parts. It's cut in several parts, but there is no any cliffhanger among those parts. The viewer may need a little time to adapt to the ratio change from 16:9 to 4:3. Of course, visually, Snyder's version is darker to reflect its content. Soundtrack is of fair quality excepts for the antique songs straight out of \"Troy\" in every intense scene of Wonder woman which borders on the ridiculous.The movie starts with a circular travelling which gives us a different viewpoint of a memorable scene from the previous movie, namely the death of Superman. Next, it's followed by a travelling/several wide shots which link the event to future key characters. This powerful opening scene makes us forget the mediocre one with parademons from the Joss Whedon's version. Then, we are introduced (or reintroduced) to all the characters :\nBatman : The founding member of the team. Bruce Wayne looks slimer in the reshoots. Unfortunately, the character lacks a bit of energy and Batman's superdetective aspects are not enough demonstrated even when he is seeking for new recruits. He functions more on money than brain.Wonder woman : Among one of the two founding members of the league with Bruce Wayne. She brings her emotional sensitivity along with her warrior skills and is less sexualized in this version.Flash : The comic relief of the team. Dumbest scenes and dialogues have been removed and his running motion has been corrected as well. The character brings one of the most beautiful and epic scene of the movie during the battle again Steppenwolf. However, I still don't get the part-time job subplot : Why does someone like Barry Allen has difficulties in finding a steady job ? Does he lack social skills or does he struggle to reconcile career and superhero life ? Obviously, its looks like a choice made so that young adults can relate to him.Cyborg : Among the best additions to the movie. Besides having very interesting power, he is source of several emotional scenes and many tragedies surround the character. His father's death may appear a bit illogical though. I think that his character could have brought some more mature and interesting subjects like transhumanism etc. but next time maybeAquaman : Snyder's version adds nothing in particular to the character and we already know the end of his story in the former solo movie. He may appear a bit clueless at times and some of his scenes have lost their fun for the sake of the more solemn tone.Martian manhunter : Interesting to see the first live adaptation of this character.Steppenwolf : Big improvement in term of character design. They suceeded in making the character more intriguing by showing his vulnerability.Darkseid : Looks intimidating enough (Thanks mostly to his hellish headquarter) even though he brings nothing special to the film's landscape. Because of the lack of means and facial motion capture, his face isn't expressive and well-detailed enough.Superman : The character lacks a bit of charisma. I have never been really impressed by Henry Cavill's performance even though there were some very beautiful scenes created with his role in \"Batman v Superman\" and in this movie as well. His ressurection is not enough compelling in comparison to his Jesus-Christ-like-death in the former movie.Lo\u00efs : Is Amy Adams too aged for this role ? Her grief is more emphasized in this version thus contributes to empower Superman's return.Joker : The character brings something special and new to the DCEU, major flaws shown in \"Suicide squad\" have been erased. However, he pales in comparison with the previous versions of the character. \"Injustice\" is one of my favourite superhero storylines, it's a pity that I think that we'll have to wait for a while before it could be adapted.Snyder's version adds a lot of scenes which introduce us and add further development to the characters' familial background : Cyborg's family, The father-son relationship of Flash, Wonder woman and her native land Themiscyra... Deepening characters' development is good but still Justice League is above all a superhero team movie.One of the film's major flaw is that the conflicts and links established between the characters are overlooked and they team up far too easily and quickly. Wonder Woman joining the team is more natural because of her former introduction in \"Batman v Superman\" and Cyborg's integration is pretty convincing as well. But, Flash's recruitment is a bit rushed and Aquaman's choice of entering in the group is totally unexplained. On top of that, the lack of types diversity and real chemistry among the characters gives a result less convincing than DCEU's competitors. The difficult entrance of the team in their first intervention is an example of this weakness. Once again, it can be explained by the DCEU's chaotic agenda management and the lack of time given for the actors to bring depth to their characters and the relationships among them.In term of action and fight scenes, it turns out to be less impressive than the competitors despite of having more powerful characters. I am thinking mainly of Batman whose fight scenes are far less badass than in \"Batman v Superman\" because he depends more on his military logistics than in the previous versions. Nevertheless, there's real improvement in comparison to the Whedon's Version. The battle scene of Steppenwolf and his parademon sidekicks versus the amazons is the best. Generally, there's more suspense and intensity in the fight scenes especially the one of the three mother boxes' separation. There's also more gore details showed in some beheading and dismembering scenes. Besides, when Cyborg envisions the brutal deaths of his peers while trying to bring back Superman's life, the film turns into a darker and more apocalyptic tune.Conclusively, Zack Snyder's Justice League is far superior than the 2017 movie, but still it falls short on several aspects in comparison to some of his previous movies. I must admit that I wasn't as amazed as when I watched some scenes from \"Watchmen\" or \"Batman v Superman\". Whatsoever, it's still a good surprise and an entertaining blockbuster, so let's be grateful and savour it during this hard time for cinema industry.7.5/10", "Not very well connected": "The biggest disadvantage DC has to Marvel is limited titles. Batman, Superman and Wonderwomen we knew previously but here Snyder is trying to introduce 3 brand new characters as well as trying to squeeze in the Manhunter. I feel the manhunter's role was very forced and maybe could have been more subtle. To be honest at times it just looks silly.I feel the dream that Bruze Wayne had from the Theatrical release was a good addition and that shold have stayed along with the future scenes from the thatrical cut. I also thinl Steppenwolf's voice was better in the first movie.Darksied while shown wonderfully should not have been the main antagonist just yet as per the stor ythat was told, it should have been Steppenwuld himself as per the theatrical release.

He also is comprehensible.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc The Russian family and city to evacuate is gone, this sub plot made no sense and didn't go anywhere\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Wonder Woman isn't a sad sack in this one but brings a lot to the table - especially exposition. She explains the Steppenwolf plot in detail.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc The Flash is wonderfully awkward, funny and central to the story this time. They didn't make poor Ezra say nonsense BS like \"what is brunch?\" this time\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Cyborg isn't a \"why is he here\" character, but the hero of the story\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Batman's desperation to put together a group to defend the earth is well written out this time\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc There is a new Justice League character introduced and the reveal is gorgeous\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc The nightmare Batman had in BvS is explained and re-visited\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc The movie ties the backstories of each character together, which is something the theatrical release utterly failed to do. In a desperate attempt to match Avenger's success DC hoped people would already know, but if they had started with single character movies other than Superman and Batman this would have been so much easier to grasp.Ok, now the negatives:\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Some scenes are still painfully bad CGI and choppy animation. Much like we had in Black Panther.\n\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Many scenes are skipworthy and dragged out far too long. The amazon fight for the motherbox seems not to end and we already know the outcome. It feels like 300 but with very muscly women having an incomprehensible accent to match Gal Gadot's.\n\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc The music is annoying and out of place. There is a lot of singing, albeit in Icelandic (I think), but some of the English lyrics are ridiculously terrible. Best example is when Aquaman saves the boat crew (a scene that could have been cut as it brings nothing to the table)\n\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Aquaman is still Jason Momoa and bro-ing it up. Not as much as in the theatrical release, but the \"My man\" and surfing on a Parademon scenes are still in\n\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Amber Heard's \"British\" accent made me miss the CGI mustache of Superman\n\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc Snyder is trying super hard to hint at more movies to come and Jared Leto's joker performance makes me want to scream.All in all, worth it though, but you do feel the running time very much. It is a classic case of a director's cut not wanting to waste any shot footage (also see: Metropolis, Apocalypse Now Redux...) I am happy this one happened and it made me look at the DCEU with more fondness again. 7/10", "Visionary artistry...": "Yes & absolutely fulfilled the expectations. The vision of Zack Snyder finally revealed.

I mean on that scene of VFX was weak .Oh yes, motion scenes were awesome, in a way those scenes can give ya the goosebumps .The darkseid remain intact, a sequel is very much needed .At last but not the least, the casting was impressive ,everyone makes their efforts very very visible .#ThankyouSnyder\n#Happywatching.", "Zack Snyder nailed it": "I am so happy that I did not watch the one that was released a few years ago and waited for this. This movie was epic and lived up to my expectations. Every character stood out and had a major role in this movie. It served as a solid movie on its own and one that could have set up others in the future. Cameos and easter eggs all around. I really enjoyed this movie and would have given it a 10, but I think it was a bit too long. The first couple of hours could have been trimmed down in my opinion but they do serve a purpose of setting up a brilliant last two hours. Maybe a bit too much slow motion shots. But all in all a very good movie and one that I enjoyed. Thank you Snyder!", "Fantastic!": "As a fan of movies this is huge!Enjoy it and don't listen to those, who are saying, that this is the Justice League Movie from 2017. It's very different.

SOOO much exposition for things that should have been given their own movies. Oh, there are these box thingies we never bothered to mention before, EXPOSITION. Let's introduce a whole new character with a rich back story, oh he's black? Better not give him his own movie then, we'll cover him with EXPOSITION.

It is greatest movie I've ever seen.", "An Odyssey...": "Gone are the cheesey Tim Burton-esque Batman intro, Russian Family that go nowhere, ill-fitting Danny Elfman score, and (thankfully) horrendous, Amiga-graphic design of Steppenwolf. Zack Snyder has restored his vision and given us closure (for now?) by replacing the above-mentioned flaws with a breathtaking introduction/recap of the events of BvS, high stakes action and real world violence, edgy Tom Holkenborg score, and a badass, nightmarish Steppenwolf, teasers for New Gods, along with, above all, heart and soul. Each character gets their moment and is unique rather than uniform. This FILM is almost a religious, meditative experience.There are a couple of issues, e.g runtime (best to watch in 2 sittings, sweetspot is at 2:16) and pacing (1st half is perfect, 2nd half is relentless- e.g. \"Man of Steel\"), and some awkward lines of dialogue, but overall ZSJL is a worthwhile experience and is up there with the best genre threequels, i.e. \"Return of The Jedi\", \"The Matrix: Revolutions\", and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" which get better with each viewing (I saw it 3 times over the weekend).#RestoreTheSnyderverse!", "Best Comic Book Movie ever!": "Everything is perfect in this version of the Justice League, it's everything we have been asking for!", "Their back!!!!": "This movie got better and better, the more you watch the more you'll love it. It sets up the future and it has restored our present, every character is better than they were, and every part of the movie restored your faith in DC", "A Tad overrated": "Well I just finished watching Zack Snyder's Justice League, and I have to say the only other of the new DC movies I have seen is Man of Steel so after watching Nolan's Batman I have become very critical of future films and so far nothing has beat his films.I'm giving it a 7 I personally would give it 7.5 because it's not an 8 neither it's a 7. I can say movies from the 90's which has gotten 6.5 or above many where underrated and should have a higher score.So my I think it's overrated, first even with a 4 hours of movie there has been very little character development, especially that I haven't seen the other movies except for Men of Steel with Henry Cavil I don't know the story about each character. I really like Ben Affleck but I don't see really being a Batman he just didn't really fit the role for it. I also can say about Ezra Miller as the Flash, after watching the series Flash with Grant Gustin there is no substitute to him. The only one that has managed to take over Cristopher Reeve Superman is Henry Cavil, so this is is why I won't give this movie a 10 there are way better movies out there, and I'm not saying that ZSJL is bad, but it's not the best that's all.I really hope that if they do a continuation of Justice League that they explore more Darkseid I think he's a formidable villain which really needs more character development of him.", "Zack Snyder's Is The right choice.": "I thought at first this was a dumb version. But after watching it, Snyder's is a genius.", "Oh my god, I've witnessed a masterpiece \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25": "Stop being a jurk and go watch it, it really really worth it.\nBy the way......

What the Hell is wrong with Hollywood? I understand that most movie goers are loath to spend more than 2 hours in a theater... This is 2021... Maybe making two versions of a movie one for theater goers (Make your money once) than make an unlimited movie like Zack Snyders version for home view! Make your money twice! Don't sell the viewing public short Hollywood! Look at how many millions of people \"binge\" watch series on all forms of streaming services! I LOVED ZACHS version at home! If I'm right... The HBO Max version is going to be a Mega Hit for home viewers because it is Epic in it's scope and story telling!", "Snyder deserves to finish his vision.": "I'm 28 and never have i been motivated enough to make an account to review a movie. The amount this cut improves the story trying to be told? It motivated me.The snyder cut is in no way perfect, some scenes were lengthened for no real reason, there were many slow-mo shots that seemed unnecessary, and I didn't need 5 shots of Barry saying he \"can't hold this much longer\".That being said, there were SO many improvements.\nHere's a few:\n1. Cyborg. I can't express how mad I am at the original cut's version of cyborg after seeing the scenes they had and passed on. He essentially went from a side character to the main character of the movie. Amazing.2. I'm still not the biggest fan of Miller's Flash. I am, however, so relieved that Snyder did Flash justice. Flash's scene of stepping up and saving the day? Hell yeah! Shame on Whedon for turning Barry into a kid along for the ride, just to save a single family in the end...\n3. Gone are many cringe-worthy Steppenwolf lines, in their place is a much more intimidating villain. He has his goal, knows his place, and this cut does such a better job giving progression for the Darkseid storyline. No one needed Steppenwolf telling the Amazonians that they would love him. He shouldn't (and doesn't) care.\n4. So... many... character teases... Martian manhunter, the atom, deathstroke, and the entire wasteland timeline. I so very much want to see all of this come togetherOverall, I think most people agreed that the the original cut of Justice league just wasn't good enough to warrant continue.With this? I whole hearted hope that it gets the traction it needs to push WB / DC into making more in the Snyderverse.", "Restore the Snyderverse NOW!!! Pretty please?": "Just do it. This film was A-MA-ZING!!! My favorite superhero movie thus far. Snyder really took the time to tell a WHOLE story. No rush, no shortcuts and at the same time, no waste of any kind. I cannot believe that the Warner executives ever chose the Theatrical cut we all know and despise over Zack Snyder's vision. Personally, I loved MAN OF STEEL and BATMAN V SUPERMAN, I just could not get enough of them. I so hope for a sequel to Zack Snyder's Justice League, like ASAP!!!I just spent 4 great hours and I don't want it to stop.Thank you Zack Snyder.And now, I hope for a Ben Affleck-led Batman franchise, as well as a Cyborg-led and a Flash-led movie on top of Justice League 2 of course.

When we think of Superhero movies, we think of light side, bright colors, action comedy and the superhero quips. Zack Snyder's Justice League is not like most superhero films, the story itself makes you think, reflect deeply. As the film is a reflection of what we often overlook from a superhero film. Everything in the movie explores what we overlook, what human emotions heroes have. This is a Superhero film you can definitely study in Art College and film school. You want from an Art Film. Everything from the film is about growth, as an excellent masterpiece. Mini-series / Mini-Movies within the 4 hour film, divided into a Prologue, 6 Chapters and 1 Epilogue. Victory here is that you see characters finally appear on screen like you've never seen before. The movie's plot explores the characters' journey bit by bit in the film. It develops the story from the drive of Bruce Wayne to go outside his own beliefs. To put in faith that The Age of Heroes needed to return. Truly a new film of its own, Zack Snyder gave us what's long overdue (since 2016).\nTo settle differences by unitingWonderful pieces of the stories of Flash/Barry Allenand Cyborg/Victor Stone are there in the film, from start to finish the film is truly the dark story we know similarly from DC Black Label brought to life as moving paintings, through a four hour motion picture.From start to finish, Just like your blueberry Pie, you simply want more...", "Snyder's cut has the soul that the movie needed.": "A film with meaning and coherence.

Totally the best DCEU CGI movie.Superman was hot, sweet and the most powerful, no words can explain how much we were robbed by Joss Whedon and WB.

Every character is well developed and has an arc unlike the 2017's version, each of them has their chance to shine, even the main villain. The moments that add levity do not feel forced and feel like additions to their respective characters, it's an otherwise serious movie and these characters surely benefit from that tone. Script is pretty tight with little to no loose ends so each character in the movie has a purpose and no character seems like a filler. Action sequences and special effects are seriously well done, very close to Avengers Endgame. The main villain looks menacing and feels like a real threat that would call upon the formation of a team such as JL.Seeing all those characters on screen at the same time fighting together made me feel like watching the old JL cartoon. It's a movie we were supposed to get back then and I do wish it so, because maybe, we would've had part 2 out by now. In any case, for any fan of DC superheroes, this movie is for you.

You have my respect Zack. I hope WB restores the snyderverse", "DB REVIEW..Zack snyders justice League..a much better movie than the original": "Justice League when it was on theater, the biggest problem was the mixed tones along with the created comic effects which was successfully done in avengers movies .\nWhen it comes to snyders Justice League, first of all I am not a big fan of snyders previous 2 works as it were all average, man of steel was better compared to bvs.but when it comes to justice League the comparison is offcourse with the theatrical version, which I would say the new movie is far superior. It has the dark tone,the story line, character Development etc which makes snyders cut different. If you ask how good the movie is ,a straight answer is difficult as there are many instances the movie did well and some not.the first 2 hours is really fast and enjoyable especially the fight with batman bringing in the nightcrawler, most of those scenes were new and are good to watch .but when it comes to the later 2 hours the movie falls bit flat .the climatic fight portions doesn't create any impact at all like the theatrical movie except the superman scene. Also batman is still like a side character who cracks one liners which doesn't suite at all ,the film should have done justice to the bat character but unfortunately it falls apart. When it comes to the nightmare sequence, Jared letos Joker is still bad and couldn't make any impact at all .also the cgi is not good in all places. Stteppenwolf was done good with an armor which is good to watch but when it comes to darkseid the cgi is bad.when it comes to character gal godot wasn't as charming as she was In bvs, Henry civil was wooden as previously and has nothing much to do,Ray Fischer as cyborg has got much more character Development which was done good ,Flash character didn't have any new development as it was almost same portrayed in the whedons version.\nOverall The cgi is not upto the mark compared to the recent movies. But one thing I admire about thr snydrr cut is the risk with the complicated and dark story line .also I hope he should get his chance to set up the triology as planned which would be a fitting conclusion to something he started\nOn the bottom line snyder cut is for all the hard-core fans across the world who possibly made this movie see the light of production, and if you are one of those fans you wouldn't be disappointed probably", "EPIC!!!": "Thank you Zack.

Especially the chemistry between Jared Leto's Joker and Ben Affleck's Batman. You ... just... want... more... Every character shines, has new resonance and the emotive quality of the performances elevates the story and the vision Mr. Snyder had.", "WB should of split this into 2": "I'm never really one to read up on films or TV shows apart from reviews, I like sitting there watching them and forming my own opinion of them. I honestly never watch trailers either, don't want to get myself hyped up for films for them to be awful *cough latest Star Wars trilogy and Wonder Women 1984 cough*. I have watched the animated Justice league as a kid and as an adult and have loved it!The film Justice League was terrible, too rushed, no character development and too many obvious interference from the studio. I wanted to watch Zack Snyder's cut because I have heard great things and read amazing reviews.It is a long film for sure but there wasn't one moment when I lost focus or interest, every single character you get attached to, it is well written and well directed. The CGI however could of been better in places I thought. Overall I sat there for almost 4 hours and enjoyed myself, WB really should of let Snyder release this in 2 parts (because of the length). Although the first 2 hours wouldn't of been that exciting on the action, apart from the fight in the tunnel. Snyder has a clear plan of how he wants to proceed with the DC universe and WB really need to let him do that, the fans enjoy these types films when they are thought out and not just pumped out because DC and WB are playing catch-up to Marvel and Disney.", "Review from someone watching this for the first time": "Never got around to watching the Josstice league since I had a feeling it'd be bad and sounded like it was and I AM SO HAPPY I didn't. This movie was an absolute joy to watch and honestly perfectly sets up the DC universe for a very very good string of movies. Acting was superb from the stellar cast (one cringey line from Wonderwoman that was directed at female empowerment but just sounded weird to have her saying that to a villian) and a small amount of humour (but not too much). The lnght might turn people off but there are chapter titles so I'd recommend people just pause there if they want to take a break. The lenght though is absolutely justified by just how much depth we get with characters like Cyborg who is new and needs a good origin story. Retrospectively reading about the original release I was just shocked at how much of this masterpiece was butchered and how many cringe jokes there were. I only cannot give this a 10 because the soundtrack is just good but not amazing. You get the nice wonder woman theme song but I didn't feel the score was as amazing as what we typically expect from superhero movies. I really like big noteworthy orchestral pieces and this just didn't stick in my mind. It is GOOD though and doesn't detract from how amazing this magnum opus is. And after this I read the dedication at the end was for his daughter and maaan this is truly a labour of love. Might actually genuinely be my favourite super hero movie now", "El snyderverse es lo mejor": "Como un fan de los comics desde mi ni\u00f1ez, me pude dar cuenta que es lo que realmente buscaba cuando vi aquella nefasta JL del 2017, ahora veo el Snyder Cut y veo todo lo que se oculto a nuestros ojos, esto es una obra de arte, no tiene compracion.", "\"Thou Art Warned: Andrew's Hilariously Critical Review of 'Zack Snyder's Justice League'\"": "Good morrow, fellow moviegoers! Tis I, the bard himself, Andrew, here to share our thoughts on the latest installment of the DC Universe, \"Zack Snyder's Justice League.\"Let us begin with the special effects, so visually stunning they are, but with a pace that is slow, slower, slowest. Tis like watching a snail cross a line, and not a race.The humor, ah the humor! Tis as scarce as honesty in politics, and as funny as a funeral.The storyline, a tangled web of heroes and villains, so complex it is, it leaves one's mind more confused than a fool in a maze.In conclusion, this film we rate with but a single thumb, for to rate it any higher would be to flatter it more than truth allows. If thou art a fan of sluggishness and confusion, then this film is for thee. But, if thou prefer'st thy films to be light and quick, then we suggest thou go'st elsewhere.", "It is decidedly average and not much better than the other one": "Yes it's longer and yes it gives a bit more backstory to the League members but it's still blah.The story of the 3 infinity stones...sorry life boxes is extended but still fails to explain how Man's box is difficult to find in comparison to the other 2. It's seemingly because it's been cunningly buried in a number of holes. Not even deep holes. Just repeated shallow burying of the box in various woods over time.Lois Lane is so distraught by Superman's death that she is filmed entirely in slow slow motion and has only one line in the first 3 hours of the film. Every morning, however, she gets her coffee and goes to the monument to stare meaningfully and slowly with dramatic music rumbling in the background at the destroyed statue head of her beloved. Yet when Superman comes back right in front of her and starts going a little bit crazy, she disappears for 20 minutes. Did she need another coffee or was she playing candy crush?Aquaman keeps stripping topless for a swim but always emerges with a new vest regardless of where he exits the Ocean.Batman loses his grappling hook a lot and that's about it for his input. An extra 4 days running time did not help Batman's contribution to this film in the slightest.Victor whines...all the time.Flash runs like Pheobe in Friends and Snyder could have done with watching X-Men for the slow motion yet fast running scenes and definitely did watch Deadpool for the introduction scene, only decided to ignore the humour aspect.Steppenwolf looks just like the Destroyer from Thor.Martha has lost the farm and just in case we're not feeling her pain as viewers it is subtly pointed out by no less than 4 repossessed signs including the phone number (555-REPO).Women refuse to watch the road when driving and there are 2 crashes in 30 minutes as a result.It is a slow (oh so slow), poorly executed, visually annoying, bad CGI containing Marvel rip off frankly. The heroes don't like each other, there is nothing really to like about the heroes, including WW who is still whining about Steve despite getting over him in 1984 - should have spoken to Marvel about making individual films sync up with the ensemble pieces.It is not good but I've given it 5/10 because by taking itself so seriously I found it hysterical in parts.", "this movie is NB!": "Perfect! wonderful! It is worth to wait!\nthe director is my hero!", "Masterpiece we deserved": "This is what a justice league movie should be and consider as canon.. Wb should greenlit a sequel.. Not just a sequel it should #RestoreTheSnyderverse..", "IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T SEE THE FIRST ONE.": "This movie is astounding! It definitely gave more justice to the story, especially to the individual characters. Now imagine if we didn't see Whedon's version. All anticipation would be gone, and every scene would be a mind blowing moment, which would make this movie even more breathtaking!\nKudos to Zack and everyone who made this happen. Now everyone wants the same thing... to restore the SnyderVerse. <3", "marvelous movie": "Absolute masterpiece and how i enjoyed my today's 4 hours was always known...thank you for making this masterpiece", "At last Justice has served for all of us": "I just finished the movie and i'm short of words right now. All I can say that Zack is genius man.", "Gem": "I deducted one star for 4:3 aspect ratio, yeah I know it allows us to see more elements but we are watching the movie at our homes and giving it a 4:3 ratio removes somehow the aesthetic pleasure of a cinematic version! Another point deducted for less variation in the story as compared with the previous version! But renting it, was all the worth for 4 hours!!", "Best Superhero Movie ever": "This movie had everything a superhero movie needs. Lots of action, great story, well timed humor and most of all an even greater cliffhanger.", "Marked improvement to the original": "I liked almost all of this movie, even some of the silly parts. Only part I didn't really like was Joker as he was kind of unnecessary and also I am not a fan of Jared Leto joker. The overall movie was pretty good, just way too long.", "I made an account just to be able to say...": "This is the best DC movie after Wonder Woman number 1. Nuanced, layered, without the slapstick shallow jokes that made it into the movie we saw at the theatres. That one scene in the Whedon flop, with Lois and Martha discussing Lois being \"thirsty\" was the stupidest thing I've ever seen and seeing what we have since learned about Joss Whedon, speaks volumes.Gotta say, I'm glad the fans and Snyder's supporters fought to bring this film to us. It was fantastic and shows that there was a vision for the universe that was going to be epic and dark. Because that's what DC has over Marvel; grit, dark themes, they don't need to copy the Marvel format to be huge successful movies, they need to follow their IP, it's all there.So after giving the original movie the usual garbage WB treatment that so many of their movies receive, including WW '84 which was terrible, they finally let someone show us their great vision for these awesome characters. It's just a shame that Snyder and the actors had to go through so much to get it out there.I really hope WB just gets out of Snyder's way and allows him to bring us his vision, though after the trial of brining this to us, but I wouldn't be surprised if they all walked away. Such a shame, dark, gritty superhero movies are just as good as Marvel's shiny hopeful ones.", "The best DC movie ever!!": "The hype was real. After getting the horrible Whedon cut this Snyder's justice league is what we should get. Loved every second of it. 4 hours flew away so quickly. Cinematography, score, story telling, action sequence and build up, everything was so epic. No doubt this is DC's lord of the rings epic movie.", "This is what it should have always been.": "This is the Justice League that we all wanted to see. The story line makes more sense and the build is perfect. My only disappointment is that there will not be more. I would love to see more of the Knightmare time line. The scene with the Joker was amazing.", "What a movie": "So much fun too watch. Definitely a million times better can't wait for more.", "Preferred the one by Joss Weedon": "I have watched both films. I found this one too long and all the comedic bits were taken out. I watched the whole film hoping it just had added bits to make the original better like the director's cut of Daredevil.Unfortunately I did not like this film and could not wait for it to end.", "Super movie": "Everyone should watch the movie...Should be released in Theatres..", "JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED": "Zack, congrats man and thank you. To the cast and fans who made this happen, thank you. MASTERPIECE. Now come on zack, sequel?", "Thankyou": "We finally got given the gift. This movie made the DC Heritage proud. Truly incredible storytelling not hindered and washed out like the original release. Scenes that come straight out of a graphic novel. These are heroes with human vices and flaws. When they work together in battle it truly embraces the Snyder vision. Thankyou Zack.", "The movie that we wanted and needed.": "This movie was much hyped and didn't disappoint. I had been waiting for Justice League for along time when the original came out. I was not wowed. Wasn't bad but wasn't what I had expected. Even my kids were \" It was alright\". But we gathered together on the 18th and watched the Znyder cut. Wow! Big difference. If this had come out the first time we could be expecting Justice League 2 about now. But no! We finally get the movie we want and Warner Bros says there will be no plans for a JL 2. The Znyder cut improves just about all the areas of the movie that were let downs of the original. It's 4 hours but it did not seem like it. Best DC movie so far.", "Justice Restored": "After an ok Man of Steel, dumpster fire Batman v Superman & a Joss Whedon edit so bad that Christopher Nolan called up Snyder & begged him not to watch how they massacred his vision, we finally have the glorious, dark, gritty DC team-up film we've all been waiting for.I know its a clich\u00e9 but it did really feel like it was straight out of the comics. The attention to detail and beautiful visuals is what brings this film alive and you get absorbed into it. The slo mo parts are perfectly executed. None of it seems over the top or forced. This is exactly how you are supposed to watch a film of this size and importance.Some obvious flaws here such as the retcon of the Aquaman film completely; Mera having a different accent, Arthur suddenly hates his mother instead of missing her, taking her trident instead of the ancient trident from the standalone film. Saying that, the atlantis scenes in Snyders JL looked and felt a lot better than the Aquaman film. Less saturated colours and bright lights and they fixed the whole talking underwater situation which made the Aquaman film look like a high budget spongebob squarepants episode.Overall I think this is best comic book superhero film to be released since The Dark Knight and I'm so happy we finally got to see Snyders vision without some corporate execs picking it apart, cutting it up and adding their own thing to it. Ever since Nolans Batman trilogy ended, DC has struggled to find the sweet spot of being darker and grittier than Marvel but still enjoyable and loyal to the comics and fans. This film finally finds that energy and shines a lantern (ba dum tss) on the new founded sweet spot they have been searching all these years.\nFilmmaker driven films will always be loved more by fans than a board of execs driven film. Disney Marvel and Star Wars take notes.", "Zack Snyder Justice League": "This is Justice League we deserve, even the CGI not that good but compare to what happened in background and the budget this would be a masterpiece of the year !", "It's the worst movie": "The darksied was powerful enough but they didn't bring him to fight with crew... That's the biggest and worst part of the movie...\nWas he frightened from superman\nPlus the batman had not enough technology as compared to the Marvel's Tony Stark\nThe darksied was powerful enough but they didn't bring him to fight with crew... That's the biggest and worst part of the movie...\nWas he frightened from superman\nPlus the batman had not enough technology as compared to the Marvel's Tony Stark.That's make that movie worst movie.Plus the batman had not enough technology as compared to the Marvel's Tony Stark.", "Insane": "Pure mythological epic myth vibe accentuated by it's duration. Loved it", "Don't get it": "Too dramatic, too emotional, too much noise, too much action. Calm down Americans.", "The Movie That Competes with Marvel": "If this movie was what released in theaters it would be a steam engine plowing to the top to compete with the popularity of Marvel. We need Snyder to get back behind the helm, get the actors back, and let this power house roll!", "The justice league we deserved": "We finally were able to watch the Snyder cut and it did not disappoint. Flash and cyborg stole the show. Batman was much better in the snyder cut compared to the other one...", "This is it.": "Never thought this movie will see the light of day but here we are. Better than I could have imagined.", "GREAT!": "Absolutely loved it! Forget the time. You won't even notice it. I can't wait ti watch it again. Thanks to Zack Snyder. Can't wait for more.... like this.", "Dull and Underwhelimg": "I personally didn't notice many differences at first so had to watch the Whedon cut again, they are about the same, the Whedon cut at least takes itself less seriously.Frankly, this is the worst version of Flash is ever and Cyborg is very boring, a dull version of the character and lack of screen presence.The two most interesting characters are Aquaman and Wonder Woman, but Aquaman was much better in his own movie and Wonder Wonan in 84, this really shows that Gadot has grown as an actress, she is much better in 84 than the earlier movies.\nI find Snyder overrated as a director , 300 has sone oddly fascist overtones as well, but this is messy even with that in mind.\nI'm the first person to criticize the lazy quips in MCU, but this movie really illustrates that the MCU casting has been pretty solid for the most part.On that note - in comics, Darkseid was introduced two years before Thanos.\nThe best scene in this movie is the one featuring the Wonder Woman supporting characters, that actually had good acting and dramatic tension.", "I love it": "I will just say, this is way better! Respect! 10/10", "Move over Avengers": "How the studio saw fit to release the theatrical version of this is beyond me. Zack Snyder should be the heir apparent to the DC throne. This movie was artistically created, thoughtful, and character driven. I'm hopeful that this will be a resurgence for the DC universe.", "The hype is real": "Zack did the Characters justice and I enjoyed the whole 4 hours I hope they restore the Snyder vers", "The Justice League We Deserve": "Zach Snyder's Justice League is the movie we fans deserve. The character development was amazing, the family element of the super-heroes was very prevalent, and the overall development was great!", "An American Epic": "Almost every shot of this movie is oozing with substance and beauty. Characters are allowed to flourish with the long runtime, with Ray Fischer as Victor Stone being the stand out performance.", "DC is heading in the right direction": "Really awesome movie with many great scenes and plot twists. Brings back what DC has to offer to the table. Warner Bros should make more movies like this 100%. Amazing movie. Recommend everyone to watch this.", "Thousand times better": "What an amazing movie and a thousand times better than that 2017 abomination! Why would they have let them make that version when you had all these scenes for the Snyder cut. Definitely watch this as it is possible one of my favorite superhero films; just hope they would make more of these. I am a fan of the MCU but ZSJL is just different and amazing in its own way where we see these DC characters in a more mature take, which I really enjoyed tremendously! If you're a fan of the DC animated shows and movies; you'll love this movie. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Hmm. Well it depends, really...": "Firstly, if you're a fan of the Marvel/DC universes or whatever, you are in for a real treat. It's simply the best I've seen of its kind. It's a vast improvement on the original.But if you're not a fan and feel this may be the movie for you to watch, I've got to tell you it's still just a bunch of CGI fights in different arenas (roman, sci-fi, urban/city...). It's the Terminator, then it's Highlander, then it's the Matrix, then it's... oh, let's not list them all shall we..? It lurches from fight to fight with the odd pause for reflective music over some slo-mo. Also a word on the CGI: I watched it on a big cinema screen and some of it is decidedly ropey and - mark my words - looks like it's already dating badly (think 'Titanic' when watched today and the only thing that was any good was the CGI and now it looks ancient). I thought Chris Nolan's name on this would be a gold standard in this stuff but I was wrong.And four hours long and on a 4:3 format..? Don't ask.", "Pretty good!": "I liked this movie a decent bit! The costumes for everyone looked awesome, especially the main villain, I loved his armor and everything about it, mainly the way it moved and flexed in combat. My one big complaint was the GIANT amount of sappy musical numbers with sappy scenes played over them. And you may think, \"oh she means that there's like, only around five\". No, There's probably around 15 of them. I absolutely ADORE the fight scenes and the Flash is a great comedic character, while also having a bit of interesting fleshed out backstory as well. My only problem is that Cyborg felt a bit too... edgy? For most of his time onscreen he's doing the \"I hate my dad for making me a monster\" and it's not in the \"this is my backstory\" it's in the \"this is all I will be talking about for the first three hours\" kinda thing. And it's not the funny Shadow the Hedgehog kinda edgy that's easy to make fun of. However, Cyborg is quite cool and I do like him when he doesn't have his five \"I hate my dad\" monologues throughout the movie. Wonder Woman is awesome, and Batman is super cool and I love all of the vehicles he uses. There is one amazing scene near the end where you'll see what I mean about the vehicles. I like Aquaman, he's quite funny at some points and not as edgy as you think he'd be. Alfred is funny and when Joker appears I like his new design! Definitive improvement over the original Justice League. To enjoy this as much as possible, I wouldn't sit through the full four hour movie, I would split it up into a few nights, like my dad and I did.", "worth the wait": "Way better film than 2017 one. The villain become more believable and story make much more sense. the color of this entire film way more consistency. More characters development and more important their backstory become more personal like cyborg. And all fight scenes got upgrade.But still 4 hour is too long for this one, the could cut at least 30 minutes out of it. Each characters had more backstories development time, though way less than they deserve such as independent trilogy like marvel did.Consider after this movie, AT&T gonna restart this franchise most famous characters, seems like most of this movie easter eggs and setup for the future darker DC universe is a dead end now. what a shame", "Visually spectacular": "This is the Justice League movie we all waited for as comic book fans.

I didn't expect Darkseid got a lot of time on the screen , great visual but you can see , it needs time to polish with the visual especially in epilogue but its pandemic times , so its hard to polished it which I understand .

Pitbull - I Like It": "I know, this article might be confusing, but I couldn't come up with better, so.. deal with it.once again I convinced myself that I don't like Snyder, as a director, at all. the movie is really too long! not in terms of the amount of material but in terms of SLOW MOTION. I don't like it, if it's too much. and the Universal truth says - less is more. + a lot of unnecessary scenes, which seemed to be present only for the reason that people did not want to \"throw\" them in the trash. \"let it be\", I guess, they said.the next big thing I didn't like about this film is - stupidity. and complete lack of logic as such. I understand, the film is about superheroes, it doesn't pretend like it something \"to Sink about\", something philosophical etc. it's action movie, but I think there still should be something logical. sometimes, it's just hard to perceive adequately.the lack of humor as such also says a lot. I don't need to laugh every 5 seconds, but the \"seriousness\" of this movie is completely unconvincing. some actors overplay. I'm not the kind of person who has to point out things I don't know about, as a professional. BUT, as a professional spectator, I can quote with confidence the words of the famous director Stanislavsky \"I do not believe!\". in other way - I don't buy it, what's happening on the screen. real people don't talk like that, don't do things like that.at the same time, I liked the fact that people realy worked on this movie, with passion and love! I may not like Snyder works, but I respect him as a creator and above all - as a person!the graphics turned out to be unexpectedly good!

Not sure how i feel about darkseid have mixed feelings about him, but don't get me wrong, he's a cool character. Jared letos joker to me did not change much, he still has that same stupid laugh.

Congratulations Mr. Snyder, this is the Justice League I needed to see!", "This movie is masterpiece #RestoretheSnyderverse": "This is a zack snyder masterpiece. From Start to finish this movie is 4 hour epicness. All the characters have great development throughout the movie and their moments to shine. There were emotions that can make you tear up. Action sequence was amazing. Epic and Masterpiece. #RestoretheSnyderverse", "It was ok": "Idk why people like this more than the other justice league. In my opinion i liked the other one better. It showed them being actual heroes more than this one. Saving the innocent and rescuing people whereas this one was more fighting evil and overcoming impossible odds. This one was a little more dark too and while it elaborates better on flash and cyborg it takes away from superman and batman in my opinion.", "Zack Snyders Epic- Lot more stories to tell": "Zack Snyder's justice league is a fireball. The movie teases lot of future projects.\nSolo Batman movie incl Deathstroke- want Ben Affleck to reprise the role.\nJustice league dark apocalypse\nFlashpoint paradox\nGreen lantern\nMartian the manhunter\nAtom\nBlack Adam\nFans must start campaigning for a Batfleck solo series.", "Darkseid IS....": "This is the BEST comic book movie ever. Snyder has done what took MCU 20 movies to do.. He gave a satisfying arc to each character and mad the audience care about them in just 4 hours.. Which really didn't even feel like 4 hours. Restoring the snyderverse SHOULD be the ONLY way forward.", "The age of a new cinematic universe !!": "This movie gave justice to the previous dump-truck of a movie. It delivered the chemistry between the league perfectly (dialogue , remarks, jokes, personalities). Zack respected the characters in a way Whedon couldn't. he made everyone have their shine in this movie. the Length I will admit dragged just a tiny bit, but it didn't matter because it wrapped up this movie properly , yet teased us at what Zack's vision for this universe could deliver too the fans. I have to say that I hope WB Or maxx picks up his story and gets it brought to a platform.", "This movie is EPIC!!": "This movie is just epic I'm glad I fought for it. It's everything I was hoping for from Zack Snyder's Justice League. Opening scene alone gave me chills I can't find words to describe it. But I can tell If this movie would've made it to the theatres it would've been huge success all around the globe. It's whole different movie than the one we got in 2017. In my opinion every superhero fan must watch this movie and experience it. This movie just leaves you wanting even more and I have no doubt on Zack Snyder's vision. I hope HBO and WB reconsider it and rehire Zack so we can explore more of Synderverse.#RestoreSnyderverse #BestDCEUMovie\n#Snydercut", "It was worth it.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is just that. It's his own Justice League and no one can take it away from him. What we got in 2017 was probably a result of all the sins that we have committed. But Zack Snyder brought everything back to life. His version seems just right. This film, the 2021 movie, feels like a celebration of JL. Snyder has given ample time for character development and he, thank god, took all the cringey jokes out. There is still some humor in the film and I think thats enough. There was no need of Aquaman raving about what he has missed in his life, this is what he did in the 2017 movie. That's just one of the examples. Zack Snyder had to go through a lot in making this movie a reality and I think it was right on the part of the fans to not give up. It was a battle against one of the biggest and most moronic production houses and we, the fans, won. This movie is a celebration of that. This movie, despite being very lengthy, will keep you engaged.", "Great film!": "This was the movie that we deserved back in 2017, I honestly hope we get to have a sequel for this, with all the original cast...", "Epic Masterpiece": "The movie we all deserved!!! The movie is an Epic Masterpiece! Thank you Zack Snyder! We need more of Justice League!!!#RestoretheSnyderverse!!!", "Better than the 2017 version, so much lower than the superhero standard": "Let's face the facts. When you say \"superhero movie\" you have Marvel on top of the mountain and DC somewhere lower than the sea level. By far better than the previous JL version, but trying too hard seems to be the motto here. The reason why Marvel has always won (this ain't biased) is because they built the characters and made you feel for them. How can you feel for Batman if you saw Affleck on screen one time or feel for Gal Gadot's WW when both her movies were... Really really bad? DC tried to dress to impress but it's just a facade with no background. I think it's very wrong to compare JL 2021 to JL 2017 instead of comparing it to the superhero genre. Congrats to Snyder for this, but there's more hype around the movie than actual cinematographic achievement. If you don't care enough for DC comics and characters you have no reason to actually care for this movie (it's just enjoyable) like you can care for Marvel if you watched the movies.", "4 hours passed like 30 minutes": "After watching Zach Snyder's Justice League, the previous version of the movie seems like a cheap parody made by fans. Victor has become one of the main figures, fully revealed, and most importantly, helpful, effective and valuable, unlike the 2017 League. It's one of the most significant detail, considering that this hero is ingenious and interesting.", "Finally we see the heart of the characters": "This was visually stunning and we finally got to the heart of the beloved characters. The back stories we've been waiting for in DC movies. Except for the obvious, brilliant Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Superman is still my favorite superhero and his comeback brought me to tears.", "the only good part about this movie is ezra miller": "(I don't know too much about DC, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong about anything).I feel like this movie was a mix of Infinity War/Endgame from Marvel Avengers. A LOT of the parts I felt were either copied or influenced by them. And, they could have easily shortened this down to at least 2 hours. Some scenes were very unnecessary, boring, or just dragged on and on. But, I love Ezra Miller in this, and was about the only thing I enjoyed. But then again, I've never read the comics or know a lot about DC, so I don't know. It's just my opinion.", "What a Movie !!!": "Well scripted and well filmed. What an outclass movie. It should be released in 2 parts.", "Storytelling at it's finest!": "The Snyder cut takes time to really flesh out it's characters arcs and build the story. Proving sometimes it's just better to tell a story. I thoroughly enjoyed the four hours I put in. Warner Bros has got to stop putting their foot on the creative process and let the magic happen.", "Zack Snyder my hero!": "I really really really enjoyed this movie!!! Zack Snyder's vision is what that keeps us hooked to this masterpiece! All the actors are fabulous! Eager to see if they come up with a sequel! We need #justiceleague 2", "1 OF THE BEST HERO FILMS EVER": "I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it's definitely well worth the wait, but be prepared 4hrs is not a stretch of length, but it's such a great thrill ride, a powerful story, and you won't recognize the time at all! There are no down moments, it's full of laughs, genuine emotion, and a great story. This should've been the original release, but we are happy we finally got it. If you go into this with an open heart and mind, no preconceived notions or comparisons I promise you'll LOVE THIS FILM! They chose the perfect cast and if DC Movies want to continue or succeed they'll need to push forward with this cast & build from there, it gives greater insight, and spotlight onto the characters, especially Ray Fisher & Ezra Miller they deserve their just due the cast is perfect as it! #SnyderCut #JusticeLeagueSnyderCut #GreatFilm #RestoreTheSnyderverse #iLovedIt", "How was this not the originally released film?!?!": "Soooooooo much better. Thank goodness Zack Snyder's version was released.", "Snyder needs to be CEO of WB!!!": "If I could rate it 100 stars will do it for sure... This is EXACTLY the movie we deserve. Of course the Snyder verse needs to be the highest priority of WB/DC. By far the best DC movie of the DCEU!", "This is a masterpiece!!!!!": "This movie is a masterpiece, full of heart and emotion with great action. It is definitely one of the best comic book movies, i encourage you to check it out even if you dislike the previous DCEU movies and if you enjoyed previous zack snyder movies like BVS ultimate edition, MOS and watchmen then you should definitely check it out.", "I hope they will restore the Snyderverse": "Zack Snyder's Justice League was a good movie. I enjoyed it while watching it, and I can say that it is better than the first two Avenger movies. Zack Snyder proved to the audience that he has a unique vision.DC movies' dark tone was something that I have liked, and I am grateful that they regained the dark tones. The film is not trying to be funny with stupid jokes and scenes. Characters were well developed and not weird, unlike Joss Whedon's Justice League. Cyborg was one of the significant elements of this film and expressed very well even the film contains several characters. The film manages to introduce every character and takes time for it. It does not rush. Everyone had much more importance in the movie, which made the audience remind that what they are watching is going to be great. Darkseid was well presented and made the audience understand that he is someone that we should fear. There were classical Snyder scenes in the movie.Even I liked most of the scenes, there were some that I found a bit over dramatized. The movie loses so much time at those scenes and makes you think it could have been shorter than four hours. I liked the new design of Steppenwolf, but his armor seems too unrealistic and gives it away that it is animated. I would like to see that Steppenwolf was stronger. Wonder Woman's song sounds nice and mythical when you first hear it, but it starts to annoy you after a while because of its repetition.To sum up, it was not a perfect movie. However, I had a great time while I was watching it. I am happy that Warner Bros let us see the real Justice League and did not expect us to be okay with the first Justice League. I would like to learn what will happen and see more of Snyder's vision. I hope they will restore the Snyderverse.", "Confusing and nonsencial, but pretty": "The CGI is good. Steppenwolf is cool. I could take Superman seriously, and the Flash provided some reasonable comic relief. I get the feeling this movie just wasn't for me, and it was some fan-service for people who know the DC fluff really well.I actually saw the Justice League in theaters and couldn't remember who the bad guy was until I saw Steppenwolf on-screen again. And he's just 'cliche bad guy' who wants to conquer Earth so that he can get on Darkseid's good side (heh heh). Kind of a shallow villain, IMO.It's on for far too long, there's some glaring plot holes and there's a ridiculous number of slow motion scenes. Lots of cheesy one liners and too much overly dramatic music. Their budget for 'fans that blow the characters' hair dramatically' was probably in the millions. We actually laughed out loud when Aquaman left town and the town's women sang some dirge and then one lady sniffed Aquaman's discarded sweater. Isn't it weird that every time the Atlanteans talk underwater they make an air bubble to do it? Isn't it weird that some mythical black arrow was shot directly to a Greek temple, and was also the key for a room downstairs? Who was the girl in the car that the Flash saved, and then we never saw her again? Why was Lex Luthor even in the movie, besides the cliffhanger? What was that epilogue in some other universe? Why is Alfred a genius mechanic?The most fun we had with it was talking about it as it went on, for way way way too long.", "More of a rehearsal than a finished product": "I've watched both, and wanted to like it but honestly swamp thing was of higher quality. It's all done as if you're supposed to be in constant awe but the dialogue is limp and the music is atrocious, I don't understand why they didn't just strip the music at least and start over. I feel sorry for the wonder woman side of things it's way too corny. Without a flash/lantern friendship JL is just a shadow, that young man is not the right flash-Grant Gustin would have made it a much smoother transition. Darkseid looks odd-the comic world of that era was constantly pulling cross rip offs so you can only fight against the similarities so hard. Without Miracle and Barda's appearance it's not going to create much interest in future films etc.", "Finally got the answer of so many unanswered questions.": "Finally got the answer of so many unanswered questions.", "Well worth waiting for": "Yes Zack! Finally a movie that brings back the smirking, smart mouth wit DC used to be so good at. The characters finally have depth and honour. This cut embodies the dark soul of the comic books while keeping it's personable charm and I truly cared about the characters again. Zack's portrayal of the Amazons is a triumph, some of the newer characters are finally given the screen time and spotlight they deserve and some surprising scenes will stay with you long after the credits roll. It's lengthy, so settle in, but it's riveting until the very last.", "THE BEST OF THE BEST": "There are many words to describe this movie with ,phenomenal, mind blowing , this is definitely the movie we deserve a look at this movie in comparison with the 2017 version the difference is clear, definitely worth my money. This has been the best experience ever and fans will love this masterpiece. Amazing", "What a difference Zack makes!!!": "When I first saw Batman vs. Superman, I really thought they jumped the shark on that. Why kill him the second movie in? We're they trying to jumpstart the franchise? Marvel showed patience in building theirs. Now that I have seen Zack's vision, I understand what he did. This was such an improvement in all aspects of the DC universe. I applaud whoever let him finish what he started. This version, albeit long, made much more sense out of everything than Whedon's ramshackle version. IMHO this was 2 or 3 movies! There was enough material for an arc in each characters storyline, to tie in at a later date with more appeal generated. If you want to build something strong ,it needs a strong foundation. I think DC rushed their foundation too much. That said, the film is a true film and not just a superhero movie...Kudos Zack and my deepest condolences on the loss of your daughter Autumn.", "You will know if it's for you in the first 15 min": "One hundred times better than the original but just as corny. Just more of the same movie if you liked the original, I did not.", "Sequel has to happen!": "That is what I am talking about. Well done! I took it more seriously and had much respect for Snyder's cut. The story and characters have literally put Justice League on a different level for sure.", "Masterpiece. 4 Hours Without Taking A Break.": "This Movie lived up to the hypes of the audience. This is the one we deserved from Snyder. For me, The Theatrical Cut Was never existed after this.", "Does Zack know what widescreen is?": "This is an improvement to the first release for sure, but not making the movie fullscreen or widescreen is a major letdown for me.\nIs Zack secretly a fan of the vertical clips on youtube?\nOr maybe he just wanted to try something really stupid like when Metallica made some songs with Lou Reed recently?\nEither way he made a really silly and deliberate mistake that makes no sense.", "Zack Attack": "Its a pure 100% Zack Snyder dream come true. If your a Snyder fan it will be what you expected and so much more.Once you do the 4hr10mins I would bet you want the next installation.If so #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Big fan of DC": "Wow what A movie by zack snyder\nLoved it\nLoved it\nFlash\nBatman\nJoker\nWonderwan\nCyborg.", "Not Perfect, but a Big Improvement": "Big improvement over the theatrical release. Characters get back story, things make more sense and flow better. The CGI overall is better - still not always as 'real' looking as the Marvel movies, but much better than before. It's amazing to watch this and see how much was chopped that was important to the story and also you can see what Wheadon added (terrible CGI re-dos, the Cavill-stache problem, and the totally unnecessary Russian family sub-plot). Really, the key issue here isn't the movie, it's the studio's rush to squish everything into one movie for the quick buck when patience would have broke the bank much more. To parallel with the Marvel movies, Snyder Cut is like the original Avengers movie, where they beat back the bad guys Loko has let into Earth's realm (Steppenwolf-ish / tough bad guy but not the biggest bad guy)....and we get hints of a bigger villain looming (which of course eventually takes us to Thanos and the awesome Endgame). Here, Justice League is the first Avengers team-up movie, with the hint of Darkseid coming that could lead to a bigger movie to come (but based on how Ray Parker and Affleck feel about the DCU these days, not so sure). Justice League is long and it still in a funny way feels short -- in that each character should have gotten their own movie(s) first, build up their characters, and then get the big team-up Justice League move....and then more build to the giant movie battle with Darkseid later. The studio cut corners to cash in faster and it hurt the process, which is too bad. That aside, the Snyder Cut is good, all the good guys look better, you understand their stories more before they join up, and love the black suit on Cavill. Plus, no terrible 'mustache removal CGI' to distract you. Nice touch with Martian Manhunter popping up to signal the next member of the Justice League as well. Worth the extra run time to see what Snyder's vision was, and erase the choppy, poor CGI-laden theatrical release from your mind.", "Same movie, added content": "The movie has a lot of problems that I want to address.1. The additional scenes provided more context to the story that was missing in the 2017 version. However, they were rather plain and uninteresting.2. Slow motion happened too often. This left a bad taste in my mouth due to the fact that felt slow.3. The fighting choreographies were uninteresting and plain. It was all about dealing damage to the enemy with punches, shooting and tackling.4. The dialogues still remains generic and nothing memorable.5. The villain still looked like bad. Come on, spikes that transforms around like the active mother boxes? Also, whenever he sees the heroes he just becomes angry.6. In the animations, Batman usually makes intelligent choices when facing challenges. However, I can't spot any moment here where he truly shines.7. What is up with The Flash? Under one moment in the movie, he starts crying before running.8. In the flashback, Darkseid was rather weak. I thought he would Omega beam and destroy the whole army.9. The runtime is unbelievable. 4 hours long for uninteresting characters.I'll just stick to the animated DC movies for now.", "A beautiful conclusion": "Being a life long fan for comics and a fan for snyder's DCEU since mos, this is the glorious yet sombering conclusion I need. Thank you Zack. Thank you all the fans coming together.", "SO MUCH better than the original": "Without trying to spoil anything, this version of the justice league directed by Zack Snyder is such a better film. It has more emotional scenes, a lot more character development, more background knowledge on Darkseid and of course a lot more action. It is also dark than the other movies but that is way makes it better. Characters such as Cyborg and the Flash actually get more screen time and character traits. And finally Steppenwolf's redesign is badass and his story makes more sense. I 10/10 recommend.", "OHHHHH MYYYYY GOOOOD !!!!!! THE EQUIVALENT OD AVENGERS INFINITY WAR!!!!!!": "The film is absolute perfect and a master piece, it has every aspect of explaining everything in an endireact way it's amazing , the fighting the CGI the acting everything was perfect.\nEspecially the spin offs there were a lot of theme .\nI hope to see part 2 in the near future.", "The Justice Served To The Fans!!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a perfect amalgamation of adventure, thrill, and fan love. It is filled with visual splendor, valiant heroes, spectacular special effects, and irresistible characters. It's only fair to say that it's truly astonishing. Ray Fisher steals the show with his Cyborg character and is the heart of this movie. Zack Snyder provided the fanatic exactly what they deserved, in other words Justice has been served!", "The Magna Carta of Comic Book Movies": "As a satisfying conclusion for the billions of fans who insisted that this 'cut' existed, Zack Snyder's Justice League does not disappoint.Does a fantastic job of connecting the dots that were so painfully obvious in the theatrical cut.Characters are also better fleshed out here; especially Victor Stone and Silas Stone. This also rings true for the flash.Every member of the Justice League brings something to the table and Steppenwolf certainly looks more menacing.Lots of surprises in there and it's worth 4 hours of your time. You'll find yourself watching again and again...", "Ancient lamentation music playing.": "Every time Wonder Woman moved, cue the \"stranded in a desert\" music. Every time it played we just started laughing.Other than that it was pretty ok.Pretty slow pace with dialogue and plenty of super hero banter.Cool enough, the batsuit could go on a diet and maybe gain some neck flexibility.But I'd watch it again, and I'd grab a screen shot every time the \"ancient lamentation music\" gets played. Hope my phone has enough memory. Lots of photos.", "1000% better than the 2017 joke": "Well Done. This is what is should have been all along. All characters in the movie have redeemed themselves especially Batman and Cyborg as well as them as actors.I have no idea what happened in the background that caused the 2017 mistake that came up. But glad this has restored faith in DC.Hope Snyder gets another chance to direct another superhero movie. If DC doesn't want him, he can move to Marvel", "Unnecessarily long": "While the movie is ABSOLUTELY 100% better than the previous version of this movie, the movie did NOT need to be 3h 53min long (w/o credits).\nThe Cyborg \"origins\" that was about 25min in the middle of the movie could've AND should've been narrowed down and done in 6-7min at most. To have a mini movie for that character in the middle of a MAJOR MOVIE is completely obnoxious. Not only was it done with Cyborg but with The Flash, he too had about a 15min segment that 1. was NOT any sort of origins but 2. on the side had nothing to do with the movie itself. It was just to show some cool stuff about that character.\nAmy Adams' character Lois Lane was probably a total of 20-25min of the movie. Her character was only important for 2 scenes of the movie which realistically would've been no more than 7min screen time.\nNot only did I disagree with the Steppanwolf (Thanos) and Motherboxes (infinity stones) storyline back then, but adding the 2nd BIG BAD was not needed in this first DC super team up as it's way too much too soon\nAfter the movie is OFFICIALLY over, part 5 begins, the \"wasteland scene\" was not needed at all. It didn't contribute to this movie but if anything, probably should've been earlier in the movie. The random collection of characters in this scene and dialogue that occurred was WTF........, again, pointless for the movie\nThis movie could've been easily a 3h 20min MAX movie, and even then possibly shorter. At that point I'd probably give it 8.", "Where's the COMICbook?": "I have watched the four hour version directors cut twice now and just discovered the two hour plus theatrical release and I must say I way prefer the theatrical release. The extended version is ultra dark, you start to lose hope more than halfway through, and there isn't a single joke. Not one!Not even win it's so obvious the joke should be there for example there is a scene where Aquaman wonder woman and Batman are all being held at bay by Superman, this leaves Flash all by himself, and in my minds eye available to produce the biggest laugh in super hero COMICS. Simply put all Flash had to do to get Superman to release the othe 3 super heroes was to pants Superman, yes, you heard me right; Flash should have made Superman'Flash' us his tidy whities and it would have not only been COMICAL but it also would have forced Superman to let go of his 3 captives.Now that would have been funny!Anyway I don't understand the concept of extending your movie by 2 1/2 hours and deleting every joke in it. Especially when it comes from a COMIC book.", "It is so Epic , you really need to watch it to feel it.": "To say this movie is a visual treat, would be an oversimplification. The story the charcters , they way you connect to them, the way they make you feel. The background score. It is probabaly the most epic Superhero movie till date, if you rank it jsut as a movie. it comes so close and in someways surpases Endgame.It is an epic movie. Everything about it feels good.

Warner Brothers clearly do not love or respect the lore and history that DC has, whereas you can clearly see the love and attention Marvel Studios has for its cinematic and comic book universe, the DCU is literally fail after fail in a pathetic attempt to rival the opposition to have what it has, like a tantrum throwing spoilt child who wants the other kid's toy.

A movie from Snyder is dark, mature and complex in its making, and this is what I love about this movie and similar Snyder efforts like Watchmen. The 4 hour length is perfect, and passes by in an instant, and it needs to be that long to describe the full arc of the lesser known, previously poorly fleshed out characters (Flash and Cyborg). And, it is definitley Flash and Cyborg's movie; they are the stand outs and have been promoted to lead characters and not just the humorous sidekicks or bit parts as was the case in the original cut. Every part of the movie makes sense now, I found the previous cut was a muddled mess and the reason for the Villains disdain for Earth was unclear. Now thier agenda is made clear, as well as the imoprtance of Superman, to the main role that Cyborg plays in destroying the cubes, and the need for Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Batman to work together to save Earth. Everthing now comes together logically; a credit to Zack Snyder for standing by his vision and completing the type of movie that Justice League should always have been. A simple dedication to his daugher at the end of the film, with her favourite song being performed by Allison Crowe, makes this movie so personal, so poignant and very emotional. Music score is fittingly superb from Tom Holkenborg as well. A masterpiece. Congratulations Zack Snyder.", "Absurd people giving this 10.": "Extremely average, bloated, dull, relentless.

This film is this 4 hour epic that puts even some mcu films to shame. This film makes cyborg a main charter, have a ark, and shows us how he is actually powerful. Superman is written as a acual person too which is great. Stepinwolf also has motivations and a killer new design. Parademons have a more dinosaur scary look to them as well. The flash isn't annoying and also has a really cool ending bit. Batman also isn't this joke machine who cry's about Superman he's actually decent. And wonder women and aqua man have way more screen time and build up a relationship. I can talk about this film all day just go watch it. One gripe I was is it's 4 hour run time takes away the rewatch Factor. But no worries because there a solution. The film is cut up into Episodic parts. So you can watch it more as a miniseries. Overall just watch it please.", "Finally got what we deserved": "Wow, just wow.\nExactly what we needed, a proper version of this film, Snyder fleshes out and expands his DCU opening many, many story arcs that now beg for completion.\nThe effects are amazing, Steppenwolf is rendered fantastically, much better than originally portrayed, Kal-El has lost his ridiculous looking top lip, everything is much cleaner and clearer.\nThe touches of Zimmers' MOS and WW themes in the soundtrack give me goosebumps.\nOverall an amazing film, 110% better than what Warner Bros wanted us to accept, social media has its bad side, but thank God for the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut let's hope that #RestoreTheSnyderVerse has a similar effect. Please.", "Sequence, please": "If only you guys could release a sequence with Darkseid, would be really awesome!!", "Epic, Grandeur of Mythic proportion": "The Snydercut carries the torch from the previous outings retaining their tone creating consistency. We are now left with a trilogy of films that is a cinematic universe much more along to Lord of the Rings than the Marvel way of doing things.In this cut we get more time with all the characters with more scenes for characters like Cyborg and the Flash and scenes allowed to breath where we get much more depth. What we get now is a film where all the characters get their beats explored and the spotlight. The antagonist is now much more fleshed out becoming a villain in a larger saga and in defeat a larger master is released.Zack Snyder deliverers on world building creating this universe that our characters exist. The visions of the future create a tantalising Nightmare world that help build the threat and the stakes and we ultimately discover that our hero's still have work to do.Snyder is a visionary master and creates beautiful imagery in every shot and most certainly delivered on his best talents. Every scene is beautiful and filled with things to process.The story flows really well and in fact chapter times really help to pace the film really well to the films benefit.What was a mismatch and in places and considerably undermined film in 2017 is now out in its full glory and it's a success of imagination, story telling and fantasy. This is one of the best things I have binged this year and that includes the Mandalorian and The Boys.Brilliant and I couldn't of been grinning more at the end.", "The comic book movie we deserve !": "As a person who loves comic book movies, i've never feel goosebump like this since Man of Steel, BvS and Infinity War ..\nthe story is much much better and makes more sense than the teathrical release ..\nbetter ending ..\nthe fighting scenes are so d*mn epic ! Zack Snyder really knows how to make great fighting scenes on comic book movies since MoS and BvS !\nand as always, the movie scores ... omg it is so Epic !\nflash is not useless anymore !\nit's worth watching, like more than once !i hope they will release it on teather soon !", "An Epic Work of Art": "Zack Snyder's Justice League, boldly titled yet fitting as this second crack at bringing DC's superheroes together on film is all about Snyder's artistic vision.A remarkable improvement over the theatrical version and sure to please his fans, the cinematography and the soundtrack play central role here in presenting a much different version of the plot that we have seen before. However, this time around with the added runtime, the story and characters are much more fleshed out. The tone is consistent with much of the dialogue being different resulting in a superior screenplay.I especially loved the character arc of Ray Fisher's Cyborg and Ezra Miller won me over my doubts of his casting as the Flash. Steppenwolf's character design itself and the villains' motivations are also expanded raising the stakes.Personally I do have some minor complaints with the first half of the film with some of the action scenes feeling clunky and the general pace a bit too slow at times before picking it up as the film goes on.This movie is proof that the Synderverse or the DCEU or however it is called has a future and it would be a shame not to see the conclusion of some very cool scenes here that serve to set up sequels.", "A very pleasant improvement.": "Joss Whedon just destroyed the work of years of imagination and creativity with a very bad movie made by himself. It's kinda obvious why he disappeared and did nothing relevant after his horrible adaptation. Keep asking why don't even Marvel Studios still hiring him for more movies.\ud83e\udd14Awesome work, Zack Snyder. We're all proud of you.", "True justice league": "Absolutely phenomenal and definitely made all the fans proud. A true fan service! Zack Snyder should be given full responsibility of the DCEU and continue his vision with the snyderverse and justice league 1 and 2", "Lets say complete story": "After I saw this very long superheroes movie I realized that it was worth it. The story now more clear than before, characters are more alive, and yes final battle is fair.", "As expected, better than theatrical cut. But not just that, enjoyable and as its best, amazing movie": "We all know the backstory with Justice League. The original, Zack Snyder's vision of the movie has arrived after a long wait. And yes, it is really a step up. The action is more clear, interactions of the characters feels more natural and the last hour of the movie is easily some of the best DCEU I have seen. Plot is explained better and the stake of the enemy, you can actually feel it. I'm very happy that they didn't bring Darkseid into the plot more than they did, it is a great tease and he plays his role as a \"big universal villain\" quite well. And addition of bringing Cyborg more in the center of movie is wonderful.Now, it isn't flawless by any means. There are still lines what feel poorly written and scenes what are way too drawn out. I think it could have used some cutting, making the movie around 3.5 hours, but I rather take more character building and plot than rushed version we got earlier. And what still bothers me sometimes, is how Zack is making everything bit too epic time to time.So, when you go into this movie, don't expect the comicbook movie of the century. If you are a big fan of Zack and give this movie a 10, I'm not here to stop your celebrating, we all have our opinions. Because you all are the reason why this movie is here. But, for non-fans I say this: It is a very good and refreshing superhero movie, what gives me hope for the future of DCEU.\nOr should I say, future of Snyderverse.", "Just Amazing...": "ZSJL is everything all we deserv in a JL movie, just fantastic.", "Serverly Better than what was Released in 2017": "4:3 Format not that big of deal in the grand scheme of things considering this was made for IMAX theaters..\n99% of this movie is ORIGINAL CONTENT not seen in theaters but you can see for yourselves if you'd like..\nIf you dont want to dedicate four hours break it up into chapters no harm no foul..It introduces new characters and tells a much bigger story with the original characters as well,,I loved this film Hope there is Sequels as well as Solo projects for certain characters in this movie!!", "hhh": "Este se\u00f1or salvo al universo de dc comics nos dio una gran entrega la mejor pel\u00edcula de dc comics hasta el momento", "A work of passion": "ZSJL is four hours of Superhero fun. It is the best in the the Trilogy (MoS, BvS Ultimate Ed. and this).I just felt that the film lacked something. Maybe it's the finale. Darkseid being the final boss could have been epic. Also, the epilogue could have been excluded.There's not much else to add. The film is decent. The pacing is good. All the members of the League feel important.I look forward to where this series go next.", "Its way better than the previous one Wb need to let zack complete his story": "NGL 4 hour is long but its worth it for this Movie, and somehow i kinda addicted watching it that way, long but divided each chapter. Its like marathon some series.Steppenwolf now have more background story not only like some lame villain who miss his mother, now we can see Darkseid and his world also Deesad etc, Batman is back being badass not cringe , flash is awesome and DIANA IS A WARRIOR again!

The 2017 just didn't feel right, very disappointing and should have been the end of DC. Its like this is a reward for 2020. Thank you Zack", "Better!": "Better story, better set up for the next movie, better art, have alot of emotions, better action (for amazons and ww only), and better CGI but not for martian and for some detail scene, like lex luther in the water in early sceneAnd still i feel that batman is still useless here in live action, unlike in animated movies/series, never show his agility and his tactical skills but i like the way they put his crazily accurate hypothesis.", "Much better than the released version": "I was very 'meh about the original Justice League movie, it wasn't great or even good it was average popcorn fare and nothing more. I just finished watching the Snyder cut and truly enjoyed all four hours of it, it not only made more sense it made me care more for the characters and actually want to see the universe expanded on with more movies.However, I think the Justice League had to flop for this version to fly - even if Snyder had been able to finish the movie the first time around the four hour version we just watched would never have been released and pieces would have definitely been left on the cutting room floor. I'm sure it would have been more cohesive and better but it wouldn't have been the same.The 4 hour run time might feel daunting but it honestly didn't feel like 4 hours, I've watched 90 min movies before that managed to drag but I felt that this version was paced well, I liked the way it was organized by chapters and most importantly the story was interesting, explained and made sense. The characters I felt were fleshed out (even more so if you have seen the other dc movies) and I REALLY want to see more from this universe now. Honestly if Snyder wanted to do a 4-hr justice league 2 and has the story to feel it I would 100% watch it.All in all I would recommend this to anyone that saw the original or even those that like action/superhero fair that maybe missed the original version.Also can we please keep Joss Whedons questionable hands off any franchises in the future.", "The storyline for this is amazing.": "I enjoyed every minute of it, from start to finish.\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "It's Better": "Well I should preference that I have not been a fan of the Batman or Superman casting at all. I would take literally any other Batman over Ben Affleck. (Yes. Even Clooney). I do like the other members of the Justice League. I have watched Wonder Woman (84 is a bit eh...but the original is great) countless times and also enjoy Aquaman. So going into the original cut I was a bit hesitant with good reason. It was a terrible movie. Now this cut does make it more interesting because you get more plot. I mean, you better for a movie that is twice as long. It makes you appreciate the characters that don't have stand alone stories to give background. Also I feel that the first version tried too hard to insert humor into the script like the MCU. It came off awkward and clunky. This version is darker and removes that forced lightness with darker music and visuals. It definitely improves the awkward cadence some DC movies have (looking at you Suicide Squad). As a nerd I love that they included all these scenes that would tie to future movies. I love a trilogy...or in this case a 5 movie series. I highly recommend you find Synder's interview where he maps out the next two movies he wanted to make. So I don't think it was a waste to watch the Synder cut. I would pick it over the first cut for sure. But I'm not even putting it in my top 10 for DC movies.", "IDK Why do people like this trash!": "First off let's get the good stuff out of the way, this is a bit better than the whedon version, stephenwolf actually has a purpose, the climax is brutal and I like the dream of bruce wayne. But the rest is garbage, I could barely tell it was an R- rated movie, it's almost the same as the whedon version, jared leto's actually good joker that the trailers hyped up for only appears in one scene throughout this 4 hour movie, Ben Affleck's Snyder version of batman is not there for 99% of the film and the worst of all, The movie itself hyped up the fact that the justice league fights Darkseid, But that's not true! Darkseid doesn't fight justice league. 2/10 garbage movie", "Nope": "A good litmus test to see if a DC fan can look at DCEU material honestly is what they think of this film. It really was an uneven mess of poorly edited tripe. This sensibility belongs left in the dark ages of 90s comics as if you would have replaced Snyder's name with Rob Liefeld there would be no difference. Slow mo, inside Slow mo for no reason. Did we need a Slow mo of water falling off of batman razor while he shaved. Plus they get rid of one creepy flash scene in the awful qhedon version to up the creep factor of Barry by having him play with the hair of a woman before he saves.Self indulgent garbage and sends the wrong message to fans that if they whine, act terribly, threaten and harass people maybe they too can get an overwrought piece of garbage of their own.DC give us more like Wonder Woman 1, birds of prey and Shazam and leave the Snyder verse buried in the basements of 90s edgelords where it belongs.", "thank you Snyder": "It's really hard not being emotional about this,it was everything I expected and more, thank you Snyder for giving the fans what they deserve and giving justice to all the characters.\nAlso joker was absolutely amazing, Jared Leto is redeemed", "2 mediocre movies in 1": "It was kind of like watching a mediocre movie with another mediocre movie stuck right in the middle of it.", "Much Improved and a great watch!": "Didn't feel 4 hours long and I actually liked the visuals.

The movie was one of the best superhero movie even without the comparison. Cause in this movie, we see superheroes who are empathetic to the people. They strive to inspire those around them. The goal is not just to save them, but to also help them. Now that's what a SUPERHERO is supposed to be.

Many non-fans might find the run-time a bit too much but it is worth every second. The final act is so fantastic that it would make you question why they decided to change it in the first place. kudos to the Snyder Team. You have done an amazing job. #restorethesnyderverse", "Way better than Josstice League": "For those of you who don't know, Zack Snyder's Justice League is the same movie as Justice League (2017), but with different scenes, more footage, and edited in a new way so it's pretty much an entirely different movie. The Snyder Cut is a huge improvement from Josstice League (2017), which was one of the worst superhero movies I'd ever seen. The Snyder Cut actually had character development and a good villain, unlike Joss Whedon's version. Snyder's version was also way less cringe and had much better color grading, because for some reason in Josstice League the final battle had a weird orange hue. I did have a couple issues with the Snyder Cut, mainly the fact that it is way too long: with a runtime of 4 hours and 2 minutes. There are so many slow motion shots in this movie-which I get is Snyder's thing-but without all that slow-mo I'm sure the movie would be cut down by like half an hour. There were also some unnecessary scenes, like the scene with Iris and the scenes with Lois and Martha. Those could've been cut out and the movie could've been three hours, which is still long but a lot more bearable. I also did not like the epilogue, because it set up so many movies that are probably never gonna happen. Leto's Joker was cool though and way better than his Joker in Suicide Squad. I think the main reason I really liked this movie is because of how much better it is than Josstice League, because I watched this with a few friends and the one friend who hadn't seen Justice League did not like Snyder's version. Which is interesting. But we all agreed that the final battle was amazing, and although I don't know much about DC, I do know that that battle is the right way to do the Justice League. I give Zack Snyder's Justice League an 8/10 overall. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but... #restorethesnyderverse.", "The real Justice League is finally here!": "Finally the online petition to #releasethesnydercut has succeeded and Zack Snyder's Justice League is available to watch on Bookmyshow stream in India.The director has clearly indulged himself in this project to showcase his vision, which makes the movie 4 hours long. Even though each scene is an immersive experience, some scenes are longer than needed and some scenes could be removed without disturbing the storyline or character development, thereby reducing the length of the movie by about 45 minutes.\nIf not, then this should have been a limited series like Queen's Gambit rather than a movie. This would have worked since it is released on streaming platforms and on the big screen even though it would have been an amazing cinematic experience.Except Superman, all other characters get more screentime and more character development and moments to shine, especially Cyborg and Fash, as compared to their roles in previous Justice League movie.I am so happy they removed the presence of that one family in the radioactive city where the heroes fight Steppenwolf. It looked like a cheap gimmick in the previous justice league movie. Also Steppenwolf is looking much better in this one.Few characters have been introduced in this version that can lead to an amazing sequel to this version of the justice league movie.Had Zack Snyder not made the horrible movie Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, we would have seen his Justice League in 2017. With the overwhelming positive response to Snyder's cut of Justice League, I hope the studio executives will understand that humor is not the secret ingredient of success for Avengers, but good storytelling.", "Overlong": "I can see why this was made and then released, so Snyder could finally get his vision out, over the mess made in 2017, but did he really need to double the duration? This film gets boring at times, specially when dialogue gets stuck/slow or slowmo is overused (99% of the time, trust me). Lots of nonsense around, along with unneeded storyline twists.I won't go deeper into the cheesiness of lots of scenes, which is also unneeded. I won't go into a DC/Marvel battle, but I'm pretty sure who took their movies more seriously and who didn't. It's not that superheroes are all serious and all that (remember Spiderman) but this movie didn't deserve such a cheesy treatment.After watching it, I was sure of just one thing: I don't want to watch this again, ever. I now enjoy the 2017 cut more that before.", "GREAT CEASARS GHOST BATMAN !

Until now, that was my favorite Snyder movie. I absolutely hated the theatrical release of JL. Joss Whedon ruined it. It was a horror movie...This cut literally took me home. I loved all 4 hours of it. The same way I love the extended 4 hour cut of The hateful 8. Sure, 4 hours is something that takes a small amount of dedication to finish. But this is a work of art. It a more than just a super hero movie. Every shot is damn near a painting.\nI feel like In today's day and age, limited series and extended cuts are what everyone needs and wants whether they know it or not. Sure, a regular length movie is still great from time to time. But when you have this many moving parts in a story, with so much sourced material to pull from, it's tragic shame to undermine the potential. Snyder has proven that. He aced this one. The studios need to take note and bear witness to new standard zack has just set and start letting the directors do what they were hired to do.", "An amazing movie that you cant get enough of": "Im hoping there will be a sequel for it with green lanterns and more darkseid", "Just because it's better than the cinematic version doesn't mean it's good": "On the positive side: The Flash is an over-excited fanboy now, rather than being a pathetic crybaby. Jared Leto has moved up in my ranking of Jokers. Before seeing this, I wouldn't admit that he had played the Joker. Now, he's the worst Joker. And the biggest plus to this version of Justice League is that the story mostly makes sense.As for the negatives, they are plentiful and powerful. Zack Snyder still seems to think he's a great creative storyteller, rather than being a poor man's Michael Bay. Because of this, he doesn't play to his strengths - action sequences. The action in the movie is a lot of fun, but barely 10% of the time was spent on action. Most of the time seems to be spent on interminably slow exposition, faux-artistic shots, and pointless conversation. But the aforementioned slow exposition has a partner in crime: some of the worst music ever recorded. And the worst part. It's 2021, why isn't this widescreen? Didn't the studio give Snyder an extra $70 million to make this release? And he couldn't make it widescreen?In short, in general, it's mediocre.\nFor an action movie, it has too little action and too many boring bits.\nFor a superhero movie, it's pretty good.

The story is nearly the same but what we get is a back story for all the heroes including the flash and cyborg who got overlooked in the theatrical cut that was only 2 hours long.\nBest to see it in bite sized cunks but only if you want.\nSee it and you will not be disappointed.", "Just one word \" Masterpiece \"": "It is the best story telling of DC zach is the best WB is thinking to make DC as Marvel they are digging there own grave.Best movie of DC", "Can we get all movies to be made this way!": "Well done Mr. Zack Snyder and Thank you!Now can we all agree, this is what we expect, when we go to watch a super hero movie or any Big Budget movie!\nThis should be the blueprint for all movies made going forward!Pure delight!\nA few minor bugs here and there, ie I believe some scenes from the last one were cut out to make way for some new Easter eggs... but... Overall, an exceptional piece of work.\nGive this man a hand!", "How a Superhero Film Should Be Done": "Zack Snyder shows that he's more than just a visual director. This Film has everything you would want from a great Superhero movie. From the visual effects, to the character build ups, to the storyline and even the set up of future movies.The DCEU would have gone on to achieve great things and given fans more of what we got here. Unfortunately, the cries of the haters were too loud and WB didn't have the guts to stick with Snyder's vision for this universe.I hope this isn't the last but if it is, what a great way to sign off.10/10", "The film we should have gotten in the first place": "Don't let the run time scare you the film flys by and is a enjoyable ride from start to finish finally good to see a director's vision out for the world to see now we can all just forget and mind wipe the other one :)", "Better than Whedons JL": "To put it simply, its better than Whedons JL but I think people forget that just because one movie is better than the original doesn't make it good. I'm glad so many people enjoyed this movie but giving it a 10/10, in my eyes, is unbelievable.", "It's Incredible !": "2017's was just 2 hours long and it's boring but this one is 4 hrs long and I felt no bore anywhere.....This movie was so intense... loved it!", "The movie we wanted and needed": "Hopefully they're smart enough to continue down this path. Amazing movie, absolute joy to watch!", "This was definitely more like a Zack Snyder movie we all wanted": "Great movie..\nWorth the wait\nLoved the background score.. lot of unnecessary clips were removed\nMany criticized the runtime but honestly every part put together so well it was worth it\nDefinitely need a sequel..\nAmazing work from Zack Snyder", "Just as bad as the original cut": "It's fair to say that if you are a fan of Zack Snyder or are a DC die hard then you are probably going to love this as it will contain pretty much everything you want and more. As someone who hasn't enjoyed most of Snyders films since Watchmen and has been unimpressed with DC's releases since The Dark Knight trilogy, this failed just as much as the theatrical cut.To start with the good things with this cut, the cringey Josh Whedon elements have obviously been removed such as the embarrassing Superman interview in the intro and the family in peril during the films climax. The soundtrack also largely delivers adding an epic edge to most scenes though there are some duds. Most importantly, both the Flash and Cyborg get some much needed fleshing out to their characters.Unfortunately that's where I found the positives to end. Visually this is a bit of a mess. The aspect ratio doesn't work and the complete lack of colour makes it hard to see in places. Someone needs to tell Snyder that just because a film is tonally dark doesn't mean it also needs to be visually dark as well. Then we come to Snyders love of slo-mo's. Used sparingly they can be effective but here Snyder has gone ridiculously over the top with the usage. By using them when unnecessary, such as Lois Lane buying a coffee, he has removed the impact of them when finally needed, mainly Flash's action sequences. And whilst I said that the soundtrack largely delivers, there is one notable exception, that being the use of Wonder Woman's screechy theme every time she makes an appearance. It worked the first time but quickly became infuriating.Story-wise, this is largely the same film just overlong and with the Whedon sections cut out. It's still the same uninteresting and generic bad guy goes on a fetch quest to get the dangerous artifacts that the first one was and even with the improved development, it still lacks ample development to make you care about the heroes mainly due to Snyders preferring to tell a story through style rather than substance. And with a needlessly long runtime at 4 hours, even the action sequences can't distract from what becomes an increasingly protracted and tedious story.Overall, it's hard to recommend this to anyone outside of the group of people that wanted this in the first place.", "The true and only one Justice League movie !": "As intense as a Man of Steel, as dark as Batman v Superman, this Justice League is just like what the fans have been asking for and, above all, it brings a necessary consistency. I can imagine that one (Warner's CEO) can be insensitive to the achievements of Zack Snyder but the fact remains that this man likes what he does and frankly ... it bursts the screen! In 4 hours of film, there is quite simply no downtime, all the scenes are of a disconcerting accuracy. Really, it's confusing that even after all this viewing time, you want more. This expansion, or rather should we say this authentic version of Justice League, is an opportunity to discover the importance of Barry Allen's role within the team. Cyborg becomes indispensable and is not just a hair on the soup, his story is touching and worked (unlike the Joss Whedon version). Of course, you have to love DC Comics and the director's vision because this film is above all Zack Snyder before being a superhero film. If you liked the apocalyptic side and the desperation that can be felt in Batman v Superman (extended cut, again why Warner is so intrusive vs Marvel Studios ?), trust me, you are going to get chills. Do you want to have all the answers to your questions, even after 4 years of waiting? You will have them. Do you enjoy intense fighting and the absence of silly misplaced jokes? So do it, watch this movie! I end with a note of disappointment. Or rather, frustration. Prepare yourself, the epilogue announces heavy, very heavy. So heavy that once the credits are over, the return to reality brutally reminds us that the sequel announced is only a chimera. But ! Let us dream, let ourselves believe that it could exist in the near or distant future. After all, this film is a symbol of hope. Warner doesn't understand they still can make tons of money, they can even bit MCU by leaving more freedom to genius such as Zach Snyder or David Ayer. That's really a shame ... a DC Comics true fan.", "La mejor pel\u00edcula de DC despu\u00e9s de Dark Night": "Se ha convertido en mi pel\u00edcula favorita en el g\u00e9nero de s\u00faper h\u00e9roes a la par de Dark Night es excelsa, \u00e9pica y solemne una verdadera obra de arte lo mejor que el g\u00e9nero nos ha dado y la duraci\u00f3n no se hace pesado al contrario su ritmo es perfecto.", "Saving DC": "Thank you Zack Snyder.

Its an experience": "One of the greatest cbm of all time.. A 4hr movie not letting you get tired is not that simple... I would say it's the Mount Everest of comic boom movie", "Boringly Average (If not Below Average)": "This movie was terribly boring and I found myself checking the time bar multiple times. The only good part I can think of involved Superman after he was resurrected and the flash. The flash was doing his thing, running fast to try and stop the bad guy, but Superman wasn't effected by his time powers. The face that Ezra Miller made when he realized this was priceless, hence why I had to give this movie three stars instead of one.", "Best comic book movie since Batman V Superman Ultimate Edition": "Zack Snyders Justice League is such a masterpiece. After all this time of fighting for it, we've finally got it. Thank you Zack Snyder for keeping us motivated. Now we fight to restore the SnyderVerse. The history lesson was my favorite part and every other scene where DARKSEID or Steppenwolf appeared. #ForAutumn #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Even with its 4-hour runtime, I was engaged from beginning to end and enjoyed most of this movie": "Having read multiple positive reviews about this movie and being hugely disappointed by the theatrical cut, I was pumped to watch this film. Luckily, I had the pleasure of watching this movie in a home theatre with a massive screen and booming surround sound. The beginning of the movie took its time (first scenes with Aquaman/batman), but I thought the pacing improved as the movie progressed.Steppenwolf looked intimidating and was a deeper, more interesting character in this cut. I really enjoyed the added back story of Cyborg but found myself emotionally uninvested in Aquaman and the Flash particularly. They would have greatly benefited from solo movies before the release of this one.There were a plethora of epic action scenes that looked amazing on the big screen. The cinematography was captivating paired with the score creating a few goose-bump inducing moments. After the movie ended, I couldn't help but think of all the possibilities left in this universe.This movie is a thrill to watch. It is grand in scale, delivers memorable moments, but lacks the character backstory to deliver an emotional punch. I still enjoyed it for what it was and am glad Snyder got to release his Justice League.", "ITS JUST LONGER": "I waited the entire 4 hours waiting for something different to happen. Its just a prolonged version of the previous movie. And I cant appreciate the fact it is in 4:3 resolution. I guess its ok if you haven't seen the previous movie, and you have 4 hours to spare.", "The True Justice League Film": "In my opinion, the Whedon's Justice League Cut wasn't terrible, but compared to Zack Snyder's Justice League Cut, it shows us what we've been missing for more than 3 years. Having the film at 3+ hours helps the develop the characters and their story further than we could have in a 2+ hour film, and with the refurbishment and elapse to the characters' outfits, story and origins, the film gives us more empathy for the characters and makes us a child again whenever we see the heroes' powers being used to a whole another level than they were in the Whedon's Cut. It's a must watch for everyone who loves the Justice League Characters and DC as overall. I'm also still shaken after seeing the film so take my review with as blown a bit out of proportions. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Makes up for Josstice League": "I rarely leave reviews but had to for this. I'm predisposed to love any film with Batman in. I originally enjoyed the first justice league cut at the cinema, but the first time I rewatched it showed me just how unwatchable the film actually is.There's been a lot of talk about the scenes Joss Whedon put in his version and now we get some clarity on what he shot and what he cut. I can say that everything that Snyder shot and whedon used was used better in this version and edited better also.Yes the run time is long but it doesn't drag. Every character gets a decent story arc. The fight scenes are better fleshed out. This is actually funnier than the original cut, despite that being clearly why whedon was going for.The final knightmare scene is pure fanboy stuff. Lego's performance as joker in the few minutes here is better than his whole screen time in suicide squad.", "Let's Restore the Snyderverse!": "From Cyborg being the heart of the movie, Batman having badass scenes, Superman beating up Steppenwolf and Aquaman and Wonder Woman taking the final hit on Steppenwolf and Flash being the mvp and saving everyone from world destruction, it's a masterpiece. SNYDER FANS WANT MORE", "SnyderCut is a major improvement from the Theatrical cut but still it has some problems.": "Here's what I felt after watching Zack Snyder's Justice League with Positives / Pros & Negatives / Cons:Positives / Pros:\n1. Big improvement in character development for Cyborg & the Flash, as both the characters clearly standout with their performance here than the Theatrical cut, the Flash steals the show in one of the best scenes of the film.\n2. Better action scenes especially the Team-up battle scenes.\n3. Steppenwolf felt more motivated, threatning & a better villian before the last act.\n4. Darkseid makes his presence felt in every scenes he was in.\n5. A better & impactful ending with different prespective from different characters shown as compare to theatrical cut.\n6. Short banter between Joker & Batman in Epilogue's Knightmare scene was great.Negatives / Cons:\n1. A repetitive overuse of BGM / Theme for some characters that might distract viewers in some of the action scenes(Wonder Woman in particular).\n2. Steppenwolf arc in the entire finale battle felt more rushed just like theatrical version without any improvements as he appears only for about 5 mins. in the entire 20-30 mins. final battle just to get smacked by Superman & doing repetative action with the axe against the other JL members.\n3. Some of the scenes in the first 2 hours felt a bit dragged & unnecessary.\n4. Some of the lines / dialogues retained from the old theatrical cut still felt cringy & sometimes out of place(like Wonder Woman: \"Kal-El No\" & Mera's british accent in between dialogues).\n5. It's still a \"Superman saves the league\" final battle until that awesome Flash scene comes.Note: Not counting movie's Runtime, Aspect Ratio or CGI / VFX aspects in above list of Positives & Negatives as that would come down to personal preference & I had no problem with them.Verdict: It's neither a masterpiece nor a bad film, it's overall a pretty Good film & yes it's a big improvement to the 2017's theatrical cut & a true sequel to 2016's Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice - Ultimate Edition & it perfectly sets-up Justice League 2 & a Solo Affleck's Batman movie(if they make).\nRating: 7.5/10", "THANK YOU ZACK SNYDER!!!": "We did it guys!!!

Flash is also not acting as a kid and he uses his powers and Synder shows what he can actually do with them. Cyborg origin story and connection with his dad was really heart touching. Darksied and Martian manhunter introduction makes look a good future for DC. And for the last, the Epilogue stole the show for me as I can't wait to see what happens if that gets realised. But since DC are not going forward with Synder anymore, I am gonna backout myself from watching anymore WB superhero movies. Watch the movie if you're a DC comic and cartoon fan and forget about anything interesting in future getting released from DC and WB.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League really good": "It was worth watching 4 hours making everything clear the story line.

Worth the wait": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is not only an amazing DC movie to be appreciated by fans but it is one of the best comic book movies ever created. I've always believed in artistic integrity and director driven films and this movie shows what a director can do without studio mandates and restrictions. This film will question the reliance of studio interference and change roles in Hollywood. As a lover of film I can say that this was one of the best movies I have seen. Everything from the soundtrack, the visuals, and the story. Everything has a purpose and compared to the 2017 version. This version puts the 2017 version back by a landslide. When Zack said that this was a completely different movie he is not joking. Everything that was added back or new footage we haven't seen felt more impactful and actually had proper character development from the villain and the good guys. Waiting and fighting for this movie since 2018 this has been worth the wait and it would be a shame to see HBO MAX or WB not capitalize of this success. A character that stood out in my opinion was Ray Fisher as Cyborg. His portrayal as a disabled teenager wanting to find his purpose on earth is fully fleshed out and he is truly the heart of the movie. I personally wish Ray Fisher could get his own Cyborg film because I was rooting for him from the beginning to end. In conclusion this movie blew all of my expectations and had me wanting more. Personally. It's one of the best movies ever made and certainly the best DC movie ever made.", "#ReleaseTheSnyderverse": "OMG OMG OMG WTF!I honestly don't know why the suits at WB shelved this.

Totally not the same movie at all. Not even close.I thought all the hype from advance reviews was just that; hype.Nah, Son.THIS MOVIE IS FIIIIIRRRREEEELegit the best superhero movie ever made. Dethrones both Infinity War and Black Panther as my favorite superhero vehicles. Far and away.Snyder's darker take on these heroes (Wonder Woman is a SAVAGE!), his push to present them as mythical legends, the absolutely PERFECT cinematography (YOOOOOOOOOOOO! This movie looks INCREDIBLE! The color grade is #CinematographyGoals), the expanded storyline, the universe building, and that goddamn cliffhanger ending all add up to what is, IMHO, the only perfect superhero movie in existence.I've honestly never watched a 4 hour long ANYTHING that went by so quickly.

DC continues to disappoint. And a pity too... I always preferred DC because it was dark, and dreary and had a very really close in approach to their stories. This spectacle of detritus, was a Hail Mary to match Marvel and to no surprise, it fell short. It's apples and oranges. Tell your story the way it should, and don't try and put your brothers jacket on and pretend you're him... it's pathetic.I lend a modicum of understanding as it may have been a budget issue, a time constraint issue or even desperation for DC to keep up with Marvel.... However; if these were the issues, then everyone should have walked away.I enjoy the director's work in other films. A few of the actors I adore. (The others, of whom I won't disparage by name, should have never become actors to begin with) I hope the contract was worth it..Terrible writing.Terrible editing.Terrible continuity with the smallest details.Terrible effects....4hrs? Someone should have been fired for that alone.If I attempted a film with this budget, it would probably come out the same...and the reason is I don't know how to write for a film, direct or act. So what does that say about the \"professionals\" at the helm of this excuse?We'll liken this film to a person having a bad day.It happens.

After watch the Zack Snyder's Justice League i have to say \"that is amazing\" this is other movie compare with the movie from 2017, in this movie we see the real justice league, exist a motivation, a search of faith, a friendship, a love for the characters. I recomend this movie, also the 4 hours pass very fast, also i love the Ezra miller's character , i love flash , in this movie flash is not a clown.In simple word i need see more of Snyder\u00b4s Universe. i do not why Warner Bros decied re-shot and deleted scenes from this movie and make the justice league a clown\u00b4s party. i repeat , i love this justice league and I would like see more of this.", "Total package": "This is absolutely wonderful.

Actually, I think the chapter division wasn't neccesary for me.The team construction was unique too. The movie shows overlap experiencies and also their differences and everyone had highlights. The best paet of this is even though you can figure out whois the strongest. No one looks weak but different.My only complain is the black suit for superman. It could be explained.

That being said, the Snyder Cut delivers on Everything that the theatrical release was missing. All of the characters have been rounded & embellished, and given their moments to shine. The plot makes more sense, with greater ominous foreboding and connection to events that transpired in Batman V Superman. Albeit this film has an extensively long run time, you will find yourself oblivious overall of it and engaged in the story line. I'm pretty confidant that not much of the Snyder Cut would have ended up on the cutting room floor had it been released theatrically as I had read that early on, it would have been released in two parts. It is unfortunate that Zack Snyder had to pull out of the project to deal with a personal family tragedy and even more unfortunate that the WB execs felt the need to not postpone the film in light of this & instead force through a film which was just a shell and stark deviation from Zack Snyder's original vision.

We dont want any snyderverse more!", "Not true to its origins": "Its an improvement over the first cut.

It has a poignant centre to it that because we are aware of why the director wanted to make his version and who he wanted to honour. The film now stands as an incredible tribute. The emotional content of the film that was missing from the original has now been put back. A superb feat!

Truly visionary. All characters have a great storyline. Stephen wolf is an actual threat and no longer a cheap CGI game character. The color scheme is on point and matches the justice league tone. Being rated R definitely gave us action scenes the way they should have been shot(some gore is perfect). Feels complete and 4 hours go by quick. I WANT MORE! Doesn't feel like a little kids movie. Feels mature and more grounded. Action scenes are some of the best I've seen. Not gonna lie I think it's better than Avengers.\nThank you Zack Snyder come back and DO MORE FOR THE DC UNIVERSE!!!!!Btw the aspect ratio is TRUE IMAX.

The beginning was so good I stopped the movie just to go watch Batman vs Superman and then continue it. This movie tied all the movies in so perfectly. It explained the character arcs in such a way that it really set it up for more movies.

This is a good super hero movie, eventually.The first release of this film was just disappointing. Joss Whedon added humour that did not deliver, was not appropriate, and killed any momentum. The editing was poor and left so many important aspects. I'm so glad Snyder did not give up on this. He was determined not to let his hard work go to waste.Recut and re-edited, with a vastly improved atmosphere and feel throughout and with 50% of content restored that nobody knows why it was left out in the first place. The missing content is so important to the rhythm of the plot as well as backstory.Set yourself 4 hours of free time to watch this.

It's up there with the dark knight. 4 hours without ever taking a break but it felt like 2 hours!", "it's gold": "It is the best thing I have seen in my whole life.", "Big Fun and Big Issues": "Initially, I really enjoyed ZSJL. With time, my feelings about it have cooled. It was a lot of fun and it was far better than the previous version that came out only a few years prior. However, if we were allowed to re-write a freshman English paper in our senior year and re-submit to the same prof for a better grade, I'm pretty sure it would be far better than the original too. It undoubtedly benefitted from years of fan feedback on 2017's \"rough draft,\" millions of extra dollars for re-shoots and epilogues, and a near-unlimited runtime, but the final product still has issues large and small: plot holes, continuity questions, some pacing that could've been tightened up, and slightly wonky CGI. That said, I still recommend watching it. It's the best live action Justice League movie available, so it should be a lot of fun for any CBM fan. (Justice League War is a better story imo.)***long rant with light SPOILERS below***I'll begin with the big issue and move to smaller ones. The entire story is built on Darkseid forgetting where the great battle and epic defeat took place. Does he strike you as the type of dude to just let something like that slide? Forget the prophecies, equations, and mother boxes for a second... Darkseid's gonna lose and just walk away without burning the entire planet to ash? Not likely. Add the rest back in and there's a 0% chance this movie lasts more than 10 mins.It's also difficult, but necessary, to look at the good parts of this movie and recognize the problems they create in the larger universe. Assuming ZSJL is canon, it pretty much breaks the continuity for Aquaman and Wonder Woman's two films so far. They both had a lot more room to grow in ZSJL than they did in JL, which is a good thing! I like these characters. I want to see more of them... but then who are the other people in their solo films and what do we do with them? When and how did Arthur get the trident and become Aquaman? How and why did Wonder Woman forget how to fly (since she apparently learned how to do it in 1984)?Similarly, when did Bruce/Batman become an optimistic beacon of hope? And why do they keep referring to each other by their various identities in mixed company? Arthur calling Bruce Batman on the island, everyone calling Supes Clark in front of the cops during the fight.. it's like HISHE when Batman goes around saying, \"Do you wanna know my secret identity?\" What is the point in a secret identify if everyone's just going to out themselves and each other constantly?I loved that Cyborg had time to shine in ZSJL after he was nearly absent in JL. Flash had actual character development and motivations instead of just being a few quirky one-liners. Most of the jokes were flat imo, but they existed in an attempt to flesh out the character, which is a good thing. Both were integral to the plan working. Awesome... but now their (or, at least Cyborg's) origin story has already been told. The fact that everyone loves that they were rescued from the cutting room floor proves this could and should have been done in solo films.DC's cinematic universe was rushed, needing at least a soft reboot. Zack Snyder's Justice League can serve as an excellent jumping off point for that reboot. It's not perfect, by any means and, given 4 hours, it had plenty of time to include things other films and filmmakers simply aren't allowed. Obviously, there are no hard and fast rules to how long a film can be, but if the studio had required ZSJL to be 2 hours (as reportedly was the case with JL), or even 3 hours, what hour would you cut and how might that effect our overall enjoyment? Whatever you cut, it can't be badass Superman in a badass black suit. Very impressive (even if he wasn't impressed). Need more of that.Lastly, the one time I got excited was in one of the final scenes. I thought they were going to pay homage to Lex's escape from prison in Superman II, but they didn't. Missed opportunity imo. The epilogue was also trash. Bringing back Leto's Joker felt forced, simply to set up other (Elseworlds?) films down the road. Both were imo the stereotypical unearned sequel tease.A lot of good in this JL remake, but quite a bit of bad, too. Fan reaction reminds me a lot of when Star Wars Ep1 The Phantom Menace first came out. It took a few weeks, but once the initial rush of 10s subsided, people finally started to acknowledge that, while there are fun bits, maybe even a few legendary scenes, it probably doesn't live up to the hype. With everything it had going for it, it couldn't just be \"pretty good.\" It didn't need to be perfect, but it should've been better by at least nailing the antagonist's motivations and cleaning up the CGI. Still, it's a must-see for CBM fans like us, so I give it a 6/10.", "Best Superhero movie I've ever seen": "I watched nearly every Superhero movie from both MCU and DCEU and I can say this is the best Superhero movie of all time, I loved how the characters were presented and the appearance of Darkseid couldn't have been better, the movie really succeeded in presenting new characters to the DC cinematic universe like flash and cyborg without the need of making solo movies for both of them, the ending was awesome and I really can't wait for the sequel of this movie and I hope it will be about the apokolips war and brings new characters like green lantern and John Constantine,\nHonestly a big thank you for zack snyder for making this absolute masterpiece and hope WB will make the sequel happen", "Its experience is mindblowing!!!!!!": "Zack snyder justice league is the best superhero movie because its direction is\nAWESOME!!!!!!!\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "Sequels Please": "The character development is amazingly done, I became invested them.

With over four hours of content you get a better version of justice league (2017) but overall it's just longer and darker a lot of the movie the lightning is horrible and does not match with the scene. Also if you where looking for everything Snyder promised it was all there for thirty second dark side only barely there deathstroke end credit scene joker end credit scene which is the only reason I watched it which kinda sucks. But the character development in this is way better than the original cyborg has a way more interesting and epic back story and ark and ray fisher shines in the role but everyone else was kinda pushed to the side. Also when Superman came in he just completely destroyed stepping wolf so that was pretty uncool because it felt like there was no conflict. Overall it was okay I feel like it seems better than it is because it's the only big super hero release since endgame which is almost two years old now so yeah that's my thoughts on it.", "Bad but also has Wonder Woman": "This movie was so bad I came back to life.

I find it criminal how much greatness of Ray Fisher's role that was cut out back in 2017 because he is truly the heart of the movie. In Zack Snyder's Justice League you'll find that this was a completely different movie in where every character such as Jared Leto's Joker gets their well deserved redemption.\nAnyone who thinks this movie is a \"cul de sac\" is completely out of touch at this point. There is a whole lot of material to build off from and that's why they need to #restorethesnyderverse", "I don't understand the 10/10 ratings?": "First off it's a good movie, better than the OG cut.

Now I don't know which kind of people are rating this a 10 *ahem* snyderbots *ahem*, but they're FARRR too emotional rn.\nI gave the OG cut a 6 and this a 7. Did the antagonist have a valid or logically reason for doing what he was doing? No. Was the CGI the best it could be? No. Did they have to do the ancient lamentation every time Wonder Woman came in screen? Absolutely NO.\nThe slo-mo, the 4:3 and the 4 hours(!) are just very pretentious and unnecessary.. and before you say \"it's his art\", there's a reason this wouldn't have been the theatrical cut, It's too frickin long for what you get.\nPeople are saying this is the best superhero movie ever.

Better than Logan or Dark Knight?", "For me it is a NO.": "A bad movie, wasted characters, disappointing plot, I didn't like it, they could do a lot better, instead Justice league Snyder cut is very disappointing, DCU rejected.", "Im big fan of DC": "Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize. Honestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film.", "Best Of All Sups Movie": "At first I thought making 4 hrs movie was a wasted. But after seeing the master work .. I changed my mind and thoughts.. releasing 4hrs Movie on a ott platform is a good option for a director to give his master work to us! Huge respect and love to Zack Snyder from India.", "Some Small Improvements, But New Issues Too": "I watched the original Justice League in 2017, when it came out. While not a great movie, it was still somewhat entertaining. Initial reviews of the Zack Snyder cut stated that it improved virtually everything about the movie - so my expectations were raised.While it's true that there is some improvement here, the changes also highlight existing issues, and raise new ones. Firstly, the 4 hour runtime is excessive. There are tons of scenes that could be cut or shortened without losing anything. Removing a lot of the slow motion would also cut the runtime significantly.The large amount of slow motion also highlights another issue (which was present in the original Justice League as well) - the CGI is atrocious. Given that a large portion of the movie is CGI, this really detracts from the viewing experience. The 4:3 aspect ratio is also a bizarre choice, given that most people will be watching this on a 16:9 TV. I cropped the movie to 16:9, and while I lost some of the picture, nothing important happened out of frame.This cut also highlights the flaws in DC's strategy of trying to push out an ensemble movie without laying the groundwork. We have backstory in the film for The Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman and Wonder Woman - which really bloats the film's runtime, and causes it to lose focus. There's not a whole lot that can be done here with editing, but I felt that I was familiar enough with the characters in the 2017 Justice League to not miss the backstory.The central story, however, is still an issue. You can nearly directly compare this film to Marvel - big bad alien wants to gather X amount of magical items to destroy the world. Our heroes need to assemble a team to stop them. The problem is, the power diversity on the team means that only Superman is of any use (despite Wonder Woman having previously defeated a god). Even Flash, the \"fastest man alive\", is virtually useless. Superman can keep up with him, and Flash gets his powers nullified in the stupidest of ways (being shot by a laser, literally tripping, etc.).The extended scenes with characters like Martian Manhunter, Deathstroke, the Joker, etc. also feel completely pointless. Zack clearly wanted to set up an extended universe, but did so without any of the finesse or restrain shown by Kevin Feige.Altogether, I don't think this cut improves anything significant over the original, and the long runtime makes the experience more tedious. While I gave the original a 6/10 (which might have been a bit high), this cut only gets a 4/10.", "A freaking masterpiece": "This film is a CBM masterpiece. Outstanding character development. Delivers the unique DC flavor that fans want. Zack Snyder sure does prioritize the fans.\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Finally! Love Snyder's work. Very Happy we got this version": "The stars aligned for both the Snyder's, fans of his work and fans of these characters. The executives should have had more trust in Zack, what the fans wanted, and to stop worrying about what was happening with Marvel. This has easily become my favorite comic book/superhero movie next to Watchmen (Snyder's as well).If WB/DC executives read these or get a summary restore the Synderverse.", "The emperor's new clothes": "This is what happens when fans demand a directors cut. After years of being whinged at Snyder finally snaps and rams 4 hours of footage down the fans throats. None of those that campaigned for this can now say anything negative about it. I can though. It's awful. 4 hours to tell the exact same story that whedon told in half the time. There's nothing new here, just an extra 2 hours of hero posing. As an added 'treat' for the fans it's filmed in a little square box.

I was hopeful after Wonder Woman but then we got all the other DC movies that were just awful. Justice league was a complete disaster. Then when I had hope for WW84 that was shattered by yet another awful movie. (Don't get me started on the Arrowverse trash)My last breath of and only hope was for this movie is that it would be \"better\" than the first piece of junk that we got.Is this movie perfect? No. But is it close in my opinion? Yes!This was so enjoyable....I don't wants to spew out too many words but let me just say the character building in this ALONE makes the entire movie that much better. People have meaning, reason, roles to play. It was incredible. I actually cried in parts that were intended to be emotional instead of just feeling empty.

Works better with intermissions but you will not be disappointed.", "A Director Makes a Huge Difference!": "I shouldn't even need to say this is the far superior film, Zack knocks it out of the park with this one with his top notch CGI and large scale action sequences that give DC fans a real treat to see the beloved DC comics heroes in action. Definitely a must watch, especially if you've seen the 2017 one and are trying to learn about filmmaking, it's truly amazing what a difference one director makes to turn a scene from meaningless and goofy to something intense and impactful.", "I wish I hadn't watched the first one.": "Honestly the first one ruined this for me I came with unrealistic expectations which I think might be unfair to Zack cause he tried to rescue it but fell a bit shot for me. Don't get me wrong he did a hell of a job no doubt about that. Unfortunately I can't erase the first one and let's be honest it's practically the same story line with better scenes and acting and pace in some instances but Stephen Wolf is still a joke of a villian & character development of Berry & Cyborg is still feels rushed and medium rare. I still blame the board members who insisted that the first one be released without zack there was no need to rush.We would have benefited with character development of especially Flash & Cyborg own movies unless you are a comic DC fan those character feel foreign and zack should be director of all.As much as I was looking forward to it unfortunately this did not save it for me", "Faster Zack, faster!": "This is a decent movie. I've enjoyed all most all the four hours. But, Zack, please stop abusing slow motion. This movie has waaaaaaaaay too many slow motions, waaaaaaaaay too many!", "A Visionary Masterpiece \ud83d\udd25": "Without a doubt, this movie is absolutely an extraordinary cinematic landmark for filmmaking.To say it's a significant improvement on the 2017 Theatrical version directed by Joss Whedon... would be the understatement of the decade. 4 hours long yet the time flies by, from start to finish this cinematic spectacle keeps you engaged through the coherent story from the mind of Zack Snyder.Each hero gets their own backstory and fleshed out storyline, something majorly missing from the theatrical release, as well as a more thoroughly expanded plot which creates a better understanding for the overall story. As usual with a Snyder movie, the visuals are exemplary and coupled with the incredible score by Junkie XL make for a very visually and aesthetically pleasing experience.Throughout the movie Snyder lays easter eggs to past comics and films and teasers to the potential future sequels he absolutely should make. The overall thought you are left with is major one and constantly makes you think: Why did the studio never release this version? And with certain major story scenes implemented into the plot, no where to be seen in the theatrical. Why did they remove them? At least in this full cut and the true version everything Snyder wanted to show was in it and should teach future studios to not interfere with a directors vision. I cannot wait to watch this again. Truly not just one of the greatest superhero movies out there but one of the best movies I've ever seen.", "DON'T SLEEP ON THIS MASTERPIECE": "It's an epic adventure. A masterpiece. It has a completely different feel to it from the original. You could sense Zack's passion throughout. Grand action setpieces balanced by heartfelt character moments. Cyborg and Flash were my favourite. WonderWoman in this film makes the WW84 version look like a farce. Batman is *spoiler alert* badass as well. I would go as far as to say that this movie easily trumps on the avengers' first outing, even rivals Endgame. The way Zack setup the epilogue by including elements of multiple dimensions has got me really excited about the SynderVerse now more than ever. Please WB, take my money if you have to, restore the SynderVerse", "It was a really good movies": "And finally, a movie in the dignity of dc fans, hopefully waiting for episode 2 of marvel fans, please do not rate it 1.", "This is what Justice League should have been!": "This entire film was EPIC!! The character development, the world building, the battles! We need MORE of the Snyderverse!", "The dream come true for every comic book fan": "The last 3 years were a roller coaster ride for everyone involved with the #releasethesnydercut movement across the globe.From Zack being fired and us watching #justiceleague in 2017 which shook us apart because of how incomplete it was of the original vision made by Zack Snyder.Fan petitions grew from that very week until May 2021 when we got the official announcement of this so called pipe dream (referred by nnaysayers) being released to see the light of the day.#zacksnydersjusticeleague is everything a DC or a comic book fan ever wished for.\nNot a minute went by when I looked elsewhere.The best trilogy of a comic book movie is what I can say to appreciate what Zack Snyder has made.\nMan of steel\nBatman v Superman ultimate edition and\nZack Snyder's justice leagueAfter watching these movies and having known what went through with the director all we can say or tweet is #restorethesnyderverseEven if you like his movies or not, Zack is a visual master and his movies actions are the best one could ever see in any Comic book movies.To be frank people were very harsh on Zack and DCEU earlier. All his movies Man of steel, BvS ultimate Edition are too good and under rated as hell. People then were too impatient and were comparing DCEU to be built like marvel, which isn't right.\nBoth the universes can function in their own way, Marvel built many movies for the big team up but that doesn't mean it's the only way.\nDC with Zack Snyder built the universe in a better way and handled it amazingly well.\n#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is much lighter in tone than BvS but it hints at a figure many times that will be one of the darkest things put to CBMs. The light tone comes from the fact that the characters are so diverse in terms of their personality. BvS was more about Batman.zacksnydersjusticeleague is a slow burn that builds and I love it! Marvel movies are fun but can be forgettable. If Marvel makes comic book movies, the tone of Snyder's DCEU films are more akin to graphic novels. HBOmax would be wise to continue the Snyderverse. Savor it.", "we want more": "This movie was amazing i saw it many times and i want more thanks zack snider for that movie. i just need more movie fram zack.#releasesnidervers", "Not much better": "I didn't make it 30 minutes into the original cut. It was terrible.I've two hours into the Snyder cut and it's really not much better. Sub-par CG and a disjointed plot rally make this drag. I doubt I'll be able to finish it to be honest - which is a shame because I really wanted it to be good.", "it's amazing": "It's is literally one of the best superhero movies if not the best\ngreat visuals ,acting,script\nmore characters development\nmore time to the flash and cyborg and aquaman\nmost of the scenes are hard to forget especially the flash and cyborg scenes\nepic music\nthe ending was amazing and makes you want more.", "Just Awesome": "One of the best DCEU movie. Hope we will see Snyderverse.", "This is DC what we want": "Too many DC movies have been rebooted. Starting from Superman or Batman. But Justice League Snyder's Cut is one of the best DC films. I am a bit disappointed with the 2017 version where there are too many plot holes, bad jokes and characters whose character deepening is wasted. Justice League Snyder's Cut is a film for all super heroes. Movie for Superman, Movie for Batman, Movie for Aquaman, Movie for Cyborg, Movie for The Flash, Movie for Wonder Woman and of course Movie for DC itself. DC has always been liked, because of its dark story. The characteristics of DC films are like that and fans prefer it that way. Don't equate DC films with Marvel films, both of them have very different thoughts. Also the fan community is different. What does WB expect by rebooting the super hero films? Advantages? Don't like Zack's version? Or how? Please note, DC grew big because of the fans. Marvel too. However, if someday WB really doesn't restore the Zack Snyder verse, and the films after that don't sell, will WB blame Zack? Blaming fans? No, blame yourself WB. Forget about the stand alone universe of super heroes. Now is the era of the super hero multiverse. We're tired of superhero reboots. In fact, as long as I live I watched Batman reboot 2 times. And, in a moment will probably witness for a third reboot. WB, give us the opportunity to witness the most phenomenal masterpieces of the century. Return the Snyder verse. If you are concerned about fans being toxic, well ... everyone can be toxic, even in the Star Wars fan group, many are disappointed with Star Wars films. The film JL Synder's Cut is one of the films that all DC fans dream of since long ago. Where we can see Zack's vision and an illustration of how superheroes struggle to defeat enemies they cannot fight on their own. My conclusion is that the Justice League should be continued by Zack Snyder. And I really want to see Omega Beam chase after The Flash.", "Joss sabotaged the DC universe Zach rescued it": "Great movie I don't understand how they released that first version smh", "Poor dialog and weak character development redeemed by a strong epilogue": "Spoilers follow\nI didn't watch the panned original nor read the comics so I'm reviewing this movie based on its merits. By the way, I'm a genuine DC fan and love Christopher Nolan's Batman and Christopher Reeve's superman.Let me talk about the first 3.5 hours of the movie.The positives:\nThe special effects and visuals were fantastic from start till end. I give it an A+. You can tell this was a very expensive movie and it pays of on the screen. Steppenwolf, Dark Seid and parademons were menacing and artistically beautiful. The voice acting for Dark Seid and Steppenwolf were superb they steal every scene they were in. Impressive as well was the graphics for Cyborg.The negatives.Dull DialogUnfortunately, as good as the visuals were, the dialog in the first three hours of this movie was bad to non existent. I rate the dialog an F. While special effect are important, perhaps they could have also increased the budget on the writing department. Every character had nothing remotely interesting about to each other or to anyone. With the greatest superheroes teaming up to save the world, you would think that would give them a topic of conversation rather than half-baked one liners. But nooo... Bruce Wayne seemed anti-social, bored, and didn't display much charisma or leadership during the entire 3.5 hours of this movie. Maybe he should have just resigned land let Wonder Woman do the job. Aquaman barely spoke anything memorable. Mera (Amber Heard) and Vulko (Daniel Dafoe) had more personality. Superman, charismatic under Christopher Reeve, seemed to be depressed the entire movie even though he was miraculously resurrected from the dead. DC Cartoons has way more personality than this!Lack of Tension\nIn the first 3.5 hours there was no real tension in this movie. The parademons and Stepenwolf were obviously overmatched specially since it was established Amazonians could handle them pretty easily. In fact all, they showed was Stepenwolf a born-loser losing every fight from the beginning of time. I almost wished Superman wouldn't show up so it would be a mildly fair fight. That's the problem when you make Wonder Woman, Aquaman etc... overpowered and invulnerable. The fight scenes becomes predictable and a yawn-fest for our heroes.Last 30 minutesThis is where the movie actually reached its climax. The scene where Dark Seid's army was about to march towards the earth was genuinely scary. Too bad that was only in the last 10 minutes of the movie.Epilogue\nThe 20 minute epilogue which showed an alternate timeline with Dark Seid conquering the earth and our heroes making a last stand was also filled with tension, drama and excitement. I thought THIS should have been the movie they had made all along. Now with Justice League flopping and losing the studio a lot of money (due to a LOT of waste like overpaying on unnecessary special effects, cameos etc...) It probably never will be made and that's the biggest shame of all.", "We did it. It was worth the wait. It was worth the effort.": "Now there is only one thing left: #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Absolutely brilliant - THIS is the team": "Absolutely brilliant. The whole movie, from the action, to the acting, to the classic cinematography of Zack Snyder and his captivating visual style, simply fantastic. 4 hours may seem like a daunting duration for a movie, but it really only feels like 2.5 hours. The character archs were all fully fleshed out. Moving story with emotional scenes and brilliant moments of comedic relief (side note, if you found the theatrical cut funny. Nearly 80% of the funniest moments were planned by Zack. None of that 20% distasteful Whedon humour)This is a beautiful testament to Snyder using every bit of that time to masterfully build the story. I write this review after having watched the movie twice.Right now, I carry the message of hope that this movie sends to its viewers. The DCEU will never be the same without Snyder.", "Beautiful film": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is grand, is ambitious, is visually stunning for its action sequences, yet character driven in the core. It's not without flaws, but what movie doesn't have flaws.I'll be watching this many times in days to come.#RestoretheSnyderVerse", "That was an ordeal": "Just waaaaaaaaaaaay too long and not very good. This is the first DCEU movie I've watched since being brain molested by suicide squad. It will likely be the last DCEU movie I will watch for some time to come.", "Glorious!": "4 hours of emotion and pure gold!\nDon't just watch, TASTE!Enjoy!", "Great remake that we all needed": "This is a much better aspiration of the absolute worst team up movie of the first one. The CGI was just great the plot seamed better, even tho it was the same.", "It's good movie !": "It's a good movie, maybe Zack Snyder may have eliminated some scenes that didn't help the plot.", "We need the Synderverse": "The long 4-year wait is finally over. Man of steel, Batman v Superman and the long-waited Justice League Snyder cut. The first part of the saga is now complete. The 4-hour runtime is totally worth it to show depth of every character, every moment.\nThis movie deserves a sequel.", "Snyderverse is upon us": "We've waited for this movie for long. And now I can't believe we get to see it. Thank u zack. This movie is amazing. As a fan, as a critique, as a comic book nerd, as a regular person Interested in comics, in every aspect. It's a must watch film. The story, the depth, the plot was overwhelming and over the top amazing. It makes u want to clench your fists and join the heroes themselves. Leaves you intrigued every story as the plot deepens. An emotional ride I must say. No one directs wonder woman better than Zack. I'm really excited to see the future it opens for Zack Snyder.", "What an incredible piece of Art": "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\nOh Man! I have just watched an entirely different Justice League movie. Zack Snyder really gave Justice to all the Justice Members. The portrayals of each character even the villains leave a deep impact in our mind. Wonderful! Incredible! Fantastic.", "We live in a society where Josstice League Is canon and this is not.": "Is the 2017 and 2021 version the same.\nShort answer is yes.\nLong answer is no.In a nutshell after Zack left the post production.\nWB hired Lord Whedon to finish JL, he then did some reshoots and used scenes from Zack's version to create this one.\nSo why they are not the same version. Well both of them had the same plot. But different story. See a plot is different , a story is different.What happened to Justice League is a good example for what would happen when you give a same story to different directors and see both of their versions.Even I was eager to watch this movie as much as the others did. Something in me told what if the movie is boring. I mean it is a Four Hour movie. How can we expect them to keep us hooked on to the screen for that long time.No problem the movies has so many characters. So there are so many things happeneing at once. It wasn't boring at all.Things I liked so much is JL 2021.\n1. Action scenes\n2. Cinematography\n3. Screenplay\n4. VFX\n5. Overall Pacing of the story.\n6. Ezra Millers' flash\n7. Steppenwolf was awesome I kinda became sad when he died.Only thing I didn't I like is Sound track. The music wasn't that good. I mean after seeing Zack's movie with music of a genius like Hans Zimmer . How do you expect me to watch the movie. Without it. I am not saying it wasn't good. It is good but it can be better.", "Incredible superhero movie": "This was an incredible movie I would have to rank this movie as my 2nd favorite superhero movie just under the dark knight, Snyder did a much better job with the storyline, the graphics, and the filmmaking. It wasn't just a superhero movie but it was a story of these superhero's that made this movie just great! It also gave me the chills throughout the whole movie!", "10x better than Wonder Woman 84": "Wonder Woman stood out the most for me personally in Zack Snyders Justice League, WW and the amazonians feature quite a lot in this movie, which is great, comparing to WW84, one of my favourite scenes in that was the beginning scene in Themyscira, in this version of the Justice League, there's a whole lot more of that and returns the feeling and tone that was set in the first Wonder Woman movie and Batman v Superman UE.Comparing to Justice League that was released in 2017 that was edited and reshot by Joss Whedon and Geoff Johns.. Zack Snyders original version of the movie that he created seems to flesh out so many more plot points and characters and ofcourse, beautiful visual imagery which Snyder is known for.Ray Fisher also stands out in this movie with his origin essentially being a part of the story being told, linking into the villains that are set up in this movie from BvS UE, these versions of the villains are 10x more menacing and interesting, with more villains being part of the story which seems very much essential, was all cut out of the 2017 version of Justice League.Receiving 4 hours for this movie is gift to fans and movie lovers, especially people who like to binge watch a tv series or a series of movies in one night, this film will have your evening booked and enjoying what I think is a great movie that will be conversed for years to come.", "Spectecular": "Zack snyder just showed us where his imagination can take and believe me you will get lost in it. No comic book movie has ever been developed like this masterpiece.", "This is The JUSTICE LEAGUE!": "That is, finaly, a live-action movie of the Justice League that I saw in animations and Comic Books when I was young! I'm so happy to see this awesome movie, that has epic moments, grea...", "Don't listen to the film critics": "I want to tell you this is very different from the Josstice League. The characters have more depth and Stephen Wolfe has much more character to him then being a Teenage Girl who wants to rule the world, no cranky Joss Jokes and the perfect saturation and tone for a DCU movie. And yeah don't listen to film critics, if you are even an average DC lover you'd love the 4 hour long movie. The critics rated the 2017s Josstice league 6.5 stars is it even worth that?", "Brilliant !!!": "Bets thing i can say about was the 4 hrs flew by! I had goosebumps throughout and especially when a DC character I loved had a 2 bits in it! WOW!!! Well done Zack and Debbie!!!", "Well made.": "Now I understand the hype. This was way better than the first one. It's a completely different movie and it really did the characters justice. It really fills all the gaps and has so much more to it than the other. Loved it. Was it perfect? No, but it's damn well made.", "Worthy of the hype!": "Lately, there have been many superhero movies and TV shows releasing with varied tone, style and stories from Joker to Shazam to Infinity Wars to WandaVision. Each one offers something unique, a different style, a different tone or maybe a completely different take but when we talk about setting up a grandiose universe with mythical backstory, epic fights, cool-looking visuals and larger-than-life characters, then Zack Snyder's Justice League take the cake. Don't get me wrong, Infinity War was epic with a vast amount of comic book characters but watching Justice League took me straight away to my childhood days when I watched Justice League Unlimited and read comic books. The way Zack perceives and visualizes DC characters is too epic and looks too cool, like they have been ripped straight from the comic books. You may or may not like the movie but in no way can you say his movie direction is bland or boring.\nComing to the movie itself, there was a lot I loved about this movie. Each of the characters are fleshed out, have a motive and towards the end you can see have changed in some way or the other during the course of the movie. Flash and Cyborg have a much more meatier role in this movie which expands on their backstories and make them much more interesting. Steppenwolf also is not a one-tone villain in this movie and has been given a motive and backstory. The rest of the leagues have extended roles as well, which was interesting to watch. The movie has done a much better job at explaining the plot points than the version released in 2017. Gone are the stupid and immature jokes and replaced by much more organic back and forth between characters, I loved the interaction between Diana and Alfred. The action scenes are much superior and have more weight to them, and they are not vastly different from the 2017 one but with a few added scenes and the way they were edited made all the difference. I also loved the inclusion of characters like Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Deathstroke, Darkseid, Joker (still not sold on Leto's portrayal) and Mera, who had a significantly smaller role or a cameo but helped in making it feel like we exist in a massive universe with a lot of diversity and history just like comic books.\nThere were a few things that I didn't like as well. For starters, the background score is something that DC has been consistently good at, but here it was either generic or bad. I wasn't a fan of Wonder Woman score in this one, Flash and Superman were the only ones I liked, but Superman's score was taken from Man of Steel. Joker is still a big no from me, he is way over the top, and at least for me he is not able to sell it either. Now coming to the run time, I don't mind a four-hour cut but it makes you wonder will big studios be ever open to such 4-hour movies and if not, why to make it that way from the inception and not a 2-3 hour two-part movie.\nAll things considered, I cannot be happier that not only Zack got to complete his movie, but we were treated with a good version of Justice League. I am so much more excited to see where this universe takes us next and cannot wait for Justice League 2 and Man of Steel 2 if they ever happen.", "Finally a true superhero movie.": "The original vision of director Zack snyder\nIs epic, serious, got some of the best action moments , good cgi not perfect , good acting, get you a compleye vision of flash and cyborg, and also Wonderwoman is such a badass.", "So much better and the true vision off Zack Snyder.": "Why they did not wait for him to Finnish baffles me very much. This version is so good compared to the other one. This version don't have much fun and is much more dark but this becomes the movie and characters very much. This is Worth the wait and even though it's four hours it's absolutely gorgeous very good Cinematography and gives very much more depth to the story and characters and explanationGo see it and live it. I do", "Zack Snyder The Visionary": "Finally, we get the JL movie we deserve. This movie was far far better than the original one and any other super hero movie out there.

The movie has a very good pace , a well written script.

They need to continue the story until completion.", "Must-see Movie!": "Zack Snyders Justice League is an instant classic, I had no doubt in my mind that the delayed gratification would pay off. A lot of people are/were concerned about the screen sizing but it's honestly nothing to worry about. The movie is filled s an amazing soundtrack to go along with it. The movie was great from the get-go and left a lot of open doors for different storylines to be explored with each character together or individually. With that being said restore the snyderVerse!", "So much better than the cinematic original": "The back stories and motivations make all the difference in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). The relationships are developed more too, which I love. This movie would have got a 10 from me, but there were some lines I liked from the cinematic original that aren't in this version 'save one person' - Barry Allen.", "Super Impressed!": "What an improvement from the 2017 version. Zach Snyder has brought the DC Universe back together and even better. Very excited for future films, and to see if they keep him as a part of the team. Would be a big mistake to let him go after this.", "What an absolute masterpiece": "Seriously, this movie is amazing. At first, one would think a 4 hour movie would be too long, but I never actually felt bored. The movie also did Flash, Cyborg and Stephenwolf justice. The former too were given an actual back story and development and the latter became an actual character, instead of an evil guy who just wants to destroy everything. And the visuals were absolutely amazing as well. Overall, it was a masterpiece and it leaves people wonder why the hell did WB release that abomination of a theatrical cut in the beginning.", "Yes!!!!": "Awesome, even my sister watched & she hates superhero movies!", "Much more better character revealing....and better cgi.......I love this movie so much......": "Flash,Cyborg specially batman was clearly revealed in this story of zack's..This is the movie which we deserved.....So much better than 2017 parody and helping to lose memory which was originally happened in 2017...Please the studio should really pay attention for continue the story line ahead...", "Enjoyed": "Way better than 2017. Totally worth watching. Fours hours passed very fast.", "Better BUT STILL BAD": "The movie is okay. But it is kinda of boring and you have to forward it while watching. Some scenes are good: barry Allen's comedy is on point, wonder woman doesn't disappoint as always and some actions scenes are exciting. Apart from that, the movie just fails, don't get into the hype.I think we judge superhero movies on a weird parameter, even okay movies are good and good movies great. Infinity was a good movie, this is a okay movie, which is watcable because it is based on superheroes we have come to love since our childhood.\nWatch it with your hand on the right arrow key. 5/10", "A beautiful masterpiece Thank u for sharing": "Zack Snyder, it would have absolutely devastating if this cut of the movie wasn't ever released. Your vision, directing and filming superb and def worth the wait. The aspect ratio, the flow of the movie was worth airing for the whole 4 hrs to watch PERFECT!! The touching dedication to autum and playing her favourite song at the end - beautiful. And the cast - u rocked!!\nI admit my daughter who is a DC fan reminded me when we went to see the 'other' movie in the cinema - I fell asleep and now I know why lol. All the joking and laughing moments where taken out of this movie abs to be honest, they weren't needed and make the movie more serious - I liked that! The focus on cyborgs story, I can see why u wanted to focus more on his back story.\nWhat I'd like to see next (hopefully) is another movie to follow up with the whole cast back. No one changed - I believe Ben is a fantastic batman and love to see more of him in the bay suit in the future and of courses everyone else.\nZack this movie was worth the hype abs wait!! It was a joy to watch and hoping one day I watch it in black and white too. To u and ur family, Stay strong and thank u", "I'm so pleased that this was so good": "I'm so glad Zack was able to come back to the and fix the wrongs.

Wonder Woman was perfect, King Aquaman has his own swag\nBUT\nBarry Allen and Victor Stone have nailed it. Ezra's one of the best of the best performances. Ray Fisher's Cyborg was the best thing in the Snyder Cut. His character feels very close to my heart that emotional angle between he and his father had me. Showstealers of the film.\nAnd THE WORLD NEEDS SUPERMANThat glimpse of Knightmare (pre-resurrection) and the main Knightmare scene (at the end) was so thrilling I'm still shivering.Thank You Zack for the Snyder Cut.Too much to say but keeping it short here by saying Both the villains were superb and the Bigger one was so horrifying... Warner Bros, You can't stop Darkseid now. so,Restore The Snyderverse.watched on HBOMax", "Ignore critics, listen to the fans.": "The Snyder cut completley restores any negative feelings I had towards the 2017 version.

Never ever ask Joss whedon to direct another movie, he literally ruined justice league, added more to production cost and ended up with a huge loss\n2. Work on an apology note for Zack Snyder\n3. Learn that patience is a virtue, if you waited a little longer non of this would have happenedI started watching the Snyder cut while skeptical of whether it's another money grab or not. I was blown away by how different it was. Realized how much joss whedon altered for the original and how he single handedly ruined the movie.Everything was amazing. Backstory, vfx, soundtracks, super cool electricity noise while flash was running, even joker !!!I never bother writing reviews but I really hope someone in WB reads this along with many other reviews to realize DC UNIVERSE has so much to offer when put in hands of an artist like Zack and not someone like Whedon", "Not much better than the theatrical movie, just more of it.": "In my opinion it's just as dull as the theatrical version, just more of the same plodding dialogue and the slow-mo scenes seem completely unnecessary and turns sections of the movie into a music video montage. If anything, the theatrical version is slightly better in the length the film should be, without it being bogged down with dull exposition and meaningless scenes that add absolutely nothing to the plot. It's great Zack Snyder was able to finish his vision but other than that, it's ultimately a forgettable movie of the DCEU.", "Not bad..but not that good. Come on.": "To the point, imho:\n1. Why so many slow-mo? What are those for?As one wrote before here, too much fillers2. The fights are not for Aquaman. He has been being 'underrated' here.3.

Thank you zack and thank you fans. Best movie in dceu. Loved the superman music and every bit of it", "Really disappointed": "It's four hours-and feels like it. It's really really really slow. It feels like a fully rendered rough cut. Just because you can make a movie of any length doesn't mean you should. Sooo much could've been cut. It could've been paced better; but no. It's really slow, long, and boring. Super disappointing.", "Doesn't do Justice": "Not as bad as the 2017 cut or WW84 but if you see it in parts it's watchable. But why every fight scene must be in slow motion? Okay maybe it tries to be epic but it's getting very tedious.", "What a DC movie": "This is my 1st imdb review and it's totally worth.

Great.", "Phenomenal.": "Four hours, and yet the first thing I wanted to do when it was over was watch it again. Everybody is fleshed out, everybody has their part to play. Thank god Cyborg is given a proper origin story that cements him in the team and crucially makes you care about him. Even the baddies look better and have genuine motivation this time. There's so much going on but it never feels rushed or that they've piled too much in. It's cohesive, it has a proper story and it doesn't leave you behind. This would have made a superb two partner at the cinema. Please give us more. Restore the Snyder-verse and let's get them into cinemas again.

It was too slow and way too much of it was just fluff to make it look bigger.I liked the Steppenwolf in the Theatrical release better, a little more depth in him. There were a few back story details that were kind of nice, but most of the extra was over done. Cut an hour out of the tedium and it could have been a great movie.", "4 hours too long...": "Where should I start? I don't know where, and neither does that movie. It's like a chocolate cake, the cake is the story, the effects are the frosting. There is one inch of cake and 10 inches of frosting.\nSorry by the effects are supposed to support the story not the opposite. Takes 3 hours to Superman to appear. All those scene showing the heroes, their drama, are so long.... then you go for action, and more explosions and more...\nThe dialog parts must hold on 2 pages.\nA kid would probably enjoy it for 30 minutes and then get bored.\nIt's not a movie, it's someone filming a videogame he's playing, and you call that art?\nSorry, I was raised on superheroes, but in my book they have a quest, a meaning, a purpose, not here.", "EPIC MASTERPIECE": "No other movie ever made who gave importance to each n every CHARACTER like this movie di, it gave justice to each of those characters as well as paid off the hardwork of those Actors, the story boarding was fantastic, it's epic masterpiece, an amazing movie with dark tone that touches your heart & leaves you asking for more.. RAY FISHER & EZRA MILLER 's true potential was showcased in it which was cut off in 2017's Justice league, both did a well job & their character build up was fantastic & can't be better than this, Ben Affleck is the perfect choice for Batman & he should continue his mantle, everyone was great gal omg she's a diva & here i would appreciate Amber for her role as mera wow u nailed it even though i hold grudge on her about Johnny depp still her performance was appreciable.

Please stop trying to make him a thing!", "Huge improvement, the Justice league we deserved": "It's alright I am not that big of a fan of DC movies but I liked it overall.\nMy biggest complaint is about the CGI. At times it feels like a badly edited kids movie it is truly laughable in some scenes, awful really.\nOn the plus side, the story is much more detailed ,the characters really have some depth to them and Steppenwolf is way cooler than in the original one.\nBesides what I mentioned and also the 4 hrs mark(which may be a problem for some people), you should give a try.", "It corrects the flaw's of the previous JL": "I will definitely watch it a second time, the 4 hours went by quickly. Great job Zack! btw let's encourage WB to allow Zack Snyder to write the next wonder woman movie.", "Overindulgent, painfully slow.. what a bore!": "All the CGI in the world couldn't save this.The fundamental issue lies with a flawed script, underdeveloped villain and a lack of connect. By over-stretching every scene, adding 2 more hours of excess drama, this version is even worse than the original.Spoilers: Once again, the only way the Justice League contributes is by waking up zombie Superman.. everything else happens any way \ud83d\ude44", "This will revive DCEU": "DCEU definitely deserved this movie this was a dying universe this movie sets the future path and an awesome storyline for dceu! Awesome experience to watch the movie if u are a DC fan then definitely u won't even know when the 4 hrs got over.", "Editor Wanted": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a fascinating film. An unfiltered creative vision that perhaps needed some filtering after all.The big question is: Is it better than the theatrical cut. Yes. How much better? Marginally. A lot of the non-Joss Whedon problems still remain. The tone is inconsistent, the pacing is all over the place and there are still so many unneeded moments.But the biggest sin is that this film is 4 hours long! It doesn't need to be that long. The first hour or so could have been cut down to 30 minutes if they just didn't use slow motion. The scenes drag on forever. Everyone just slowly broods around. Every scene is extended well beyond it's breaking point. Almost as if Snyder was like \"hey I can do whatever I want.\" Making the first hour a slog to get through.There is a sweet spot between the Whedon and Snyder version that needed to be found.So the good: Gone is the cheesy opening and painfully obvious Whedon reshoots and terrible jokes. The long running time gives more time for character development to help you understand the motivations of the Justice League members and the backstory and importance of the film's mcguffins, The Mother Boxes.Cyborg gets a full arc put back into the film and is one the highlights of the new version. I don't know why his arc was removed in the first place. Also the bland and terrible CGI villain Steppenwolf is like a whole new character. He's menacing and actually has some backstory and motivation.The ending fight sequence is much much better. The beats play out nicely, the pacing is there and it feels much more, for lack of a better term, epic.And of course the things that worked in the original, mostly Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot, are still there.Now the bad: The story beats are nearly the same. There aren't many surprises here, so when it's stripped down you are left with the same team-up story formula. Albeit a richer one but the same one you saw four years ago.As I mentioned before Snyder doubles down on his worst tendencies, brooding heroes, dark tones, sad songs and his gratuitous use of slow motion. Which adds so much time to the running time.The film is an hour too long. There is an unneeded and laughably bad epilogue. That is full of obvious green screens, actors not in the same room together and confusing non-sensical dialogue.This and some of the side plots that didn't seem to go anywhere needed to be cut. Plus the film just doesn't seem to end. Just when you think its over... Bam, there's another scene.But overall let's celebrate the film for what it is. A director given the unbelievable chance to return to the work he left. Its weird, overly long, dark and violent. Just the way Zack Snyder likes it.", "Loved the 4hrs": "Watched 3 times ..worth the wait.I hope they restore the Snyder verse!", "Must watch if you're a superfan, but not worthwhile for anyone else": "Keep in mind, I haven't seen a lot of DCEU movies leading up to this one; the only one I saw was Wonder Woman, and that was a long time ago, so my memory is vague. I haven't seen Man of Steel, Batman Vs. Superman, or the original Justice League, so I might be missing out on a significant amount of buildup, but I also think that's good because I can provide a casual moviegoers perspective on this film and see if it's worthwhile in that context.\nI watched this movie because I had seen the constant social media campaigning and all of the petitions going around to Release the Snyder Cut, and I wanted to see whether it was worth the hype or not. Because of my low investment level in the campaign and in this movie, I didn't have super high expectations. I was going in just expecting a decent enough superhero movie, and the movie managed to both exceed my expectations and disappoint me at the same time.\nThe first thing anyone will notice when watching is that this movie is in a 4:3 aspect ratio. This really annoyed me at first, but I eventually got used to it, and in the end, I'm happy they didn't try to cut off part of the screen to make it widescreen.\nHowever, my actual problems with the movie start with the beginning. It's a slog. It takes the movie about half way into its run time to really start to get going, and that wouldn't be a huge problem if it was the normal 2 hours. But no, this movie is 4 HOURS long. That means that you essentially have to watch one boring movie before you can watch one decent movie. Thankfully, the movie is conveniently split up into 7 different parts with an opening and an epilogue. I took advantage of this and watched the movie over the course of 6 days. I do think that watching this movie like a 6 part miniseries is the best way to do it, but I still don't think that time investment is going to be very worthwhile for casual viewers.\nBut, hey, it's a superhero movie! At least there's going to be good action scenes, right? Well, that's what I was hoping, but that was not the case. The action scenes are typically filled to the brim with CGI and slow-mo, and if that's what you're into, then this movie will be like paradise for you. However, I prefer action scenes to be more choreography based and easy to follow, and that is not what this movie offers. That's not to say that there aren't action scenes in the movie that I enjoyed (after all, it is 4 hours long), but the bad far outweighs the good in my opinion.\nAlso, this movie has A LOT of fan service, which is great for the people who have been here from the beginning, but for casual movie watchers, it can be a bit confusing. Now, I don't want to spoil anything for people who do want to watch the movie, but there are a few characters that barely do anything and are obviously just there to get claps and cheers from die hard fans in the theater (even though this movie isn't even in theaters, so mission failed). You could take these characters out of the movie and absolutely nothing would change. Now, one could argue that these characters were setups for a sequel, but what's the point of that when WB has stated that no sequels to this film are going to be made? I know that it was Zack Snyder's vision to have sequels, but they're not happening, so it puts this movie in an awkward position.\nHowever, there are still parts of the movie that I liked. There are some cool superpower moments, particularly from Superman and the Flash, and most of the characters in the movie are likable and bounce off of each other well. But overall, the movie is a mostly forgettable, generic superhero romp that will certainly satisfy Zack Snyder and DC fans, but disappoint anyone else.", "Superman and Flash and the goats": "Really great film. Junkie XL and Hans Zimmer and great at always. Cavill is the goat.", "Greatest movie ever": "10/10 greatest dc movie ever including The dark Knight trilogy,", "a well made superhero movie. comparisons are hateful, but nothing to envy to Marvel": "A really good movie. It has everything you need to entertain youeself. Darkness, humor, violence, etc\nUses the similar structure as marvel movies. humor of antman and starlord is made by flash and aquaman, defeat, resilience and thriump of the heroes. anyways...you know the end but you enjoy the ride...because everything is told in a way it carches your atention and empathise with the characters\nand yes...once you see it...you want more...in the end...thats the sensation we all want after watching a movie or reading a book!", "4 hours of Epicness": "Best DCEU movie till date. Each and every character has their strong backstory. This should be canon for upcoming DCEU movies. Restore zack snyder's vision.", "Continuation!!!! Please!": "Snyder, you did it, you did the impossible! It turned into a junk movie and a very good one!", "WANT PART 2": "This movie is just awesome. I read so many reviews and watched so many review videos I can not agree with them that this movie is not for a mass audience. Rather I think and feel that everyone can enjoy the movie. Everyone was comparing with Marvel Universe but now I think there is no comparison. DC just made it different. And it's happened only because of ZACK SNYDER. Now I WANT PART 2 of it.

Though it was long, but it was worth it..... No single boring moment in it", "Definitely better than the original theater release": "I'm gonna get straight to the pros and cons as I saw them...yes this is full of spoilers....Pros\ncgi for steppenwolf was much easier to see and understand the logic in his armor playing.-storyline is much more complex and has the reason for us to buying to the characters. It also filled in gaps left from the first film so it answers the why's and reasons behind some whedon version decisions.\nrun time was long but with the added content it helped the characters become more relatable and have more heart.-additions of martian manhunter, injustice storyline tie in, iris, lab tech, and darkseid really made it fun for fans of DC comics.\noverall feel and tone was darker and more gritty. This is much needed bc it sets DC apart from Marvel in tone. Don't be a generic knockoff of another brand, set up your films to be a different feel. I loved that it set itself apart in this regard.fight scenes were given their due strength by extending them and showcasing steppenwolf and his strength. The weakest fight was against arthur and mera in atlantis. But the amazons fight was brutal and gave credence to their strength and wisdom in battles.Cons\nthere was several scenes completely done by computer graphics, BUT this is probably due to the time and budget restraints of this project. So just having it in there isn't a knock, just that it was noticeable.the music throughout the film was probably off bc of the budget too, the song sang where arthur goes in the water was weird, I understand the theory behind them singing, but could have been a more symbolic sea shanty type of song...maybe not that type but something mystical and symbolic of the feelings of the people who worship him.the scene with iris was very nice and sweet, but the random hotdog by her face moment felt like a bad dick joke about to happen. I actually laughed out loud there bc I did not where he was going with that. Maybe have the hotdog he picks out of the air not be so close to her face.barrys running style is really awkward at times and others look typical superhero style. Pick one and go with it all the time.amber heard has rich red hair in Aquaman, yet it's blondish in this...obviously her character doesn't dye her hair bc of the dyes in water would be harmful to the fish I would assume.teasing injustice just isn't fair UNLESS you're gonna have snyder come back to fulfil this promise of one the craziest and most unique storylines of all time for DC.Overall I give this movie a 9 bc the flaws were minimal, and given more of a budget and time it would have probably fixed the CGI issues and music problems. Zack Snyder is a genius and it is obvious how much he studied DC in order to pull this off. HBO Max is worth the price just to see this film. I hope DC can see the work and repair the relationship with Zack. We need more Zack Snyder DC movies. Also Jared Leto as Joker in Suicide Squad was terrible. In this he seemed to be more of what joker would be and less trying to reinvent the character.", "The story needs to be continued...": "Well the wait is worth it, amazing art of Fantasized, an absolutely best screenplay & Character development.

It actually delivers.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is very good! 2017's \"Josstice League\" is an odd and underwhelming movie that made odd choices, from a watered down story to overly quippy dialog, to awkward moments that only served to lighten the tone, but did nothing to strengthen the quality. It felt like DC and Warner WB were upset by the dark and gloomy feel, apparently they did not see The Watchmen... Opting to shorten its run time and trimming everything out of substance or charm. It felt like Marvel, minus the connective tissue and solid storytelling that Marvel is known for.We have here a 4 hour movie broken into 6 parts and an epilogue, and I really enjoyed how it takes its time, it breathes, but it's never boring. Harkening back to the way movies used to be made before committee-think shortened run times for greater turnaround and appealing to broader audiences with less attention spans or intelligence.We have a movie here that's atmospheric, emotional, and smart. Drama building, and never rushed. Even when nothing was going on it still felt captivating. Changing Steppenwolf's appearance was a good choice, making him feel more ominous and otherworldly. His character motivation was better executed, instead of being just some baddie taking over earth, we have a realistic character motivation, as he's trying to get back into the good graces of his ruler Darkseid. It felt tonally right.Cyborg was given proper backstory here, as were all the main characters, giving it a well thought out and balanced feel. All the lame and awkward humor is now gone, yet it still had funny moments that felt earned and within the tone of the movie.The only negative is that the ending felt slightly tacked on, but still not bad. I really enjoyed Superman's storyarch. I really liked Cyborg's storyline. I enjoyed its substance and proper character motivations. I liked the rich dark color saturation and beautiful look and feel. All in all, I have to say that I feel like this redeemed The Justice League and I'm proud to say I'm a fan again! A beautiful movie that salvaged the franchise.", "Zak Snider made best DC Universe": "No one Marvels movie can compare with this one.

Except just don;t like Esra as barry who plasy him!\nCybrog fleshed out more, but still quite boring a charcter.\nSuperman, is superman. Nothing new or extra here really!You can see the bind Joss was put in, turning 4 hours into 2.Whch is why it's such a mess.But again, you get same old problems with Zac, often visuals more importaant than anythign else, and often found I was bored early on.

Now when I was small my oldest Brother started my love for Comic Books and becoming a Gamer. I'm also a Women. And my dear Brother gave me his first ten editions of Batman Comics in the 1960s to love and enjoy. I still have them long after he died and cherish them.

Everything is so balanced.I have been a comic book fan for as long as I can remember. My life was with these inspirational characters. I grew up with them. Played with them. Then I've got to read them. Among most of the comic book publishing companies, DC is very special to me because most of my favorites characters and events were from DC comics. So if you're a true DC fan you can imagine the disappointments we had over the past couple of years. This movie came as a blessing to all those disappointments. This is amazing in every way. I can't even explain. Everything was so perfect. This is what DC is about. This is what DC is supposed to be. The characters were really good as they're supposed to be. Every Character has their own important story. These characters are not unfamiliar. We know them like our own.

Yes it was long but to have that full experience I can cope with that and I wouldn't want to loose any parts out of the film. I'm really happy Snyder got the chance to do this and make it right.

And I was optimistic it would be far better than the Josstice League version, however I was never expecting to not only become Zack Snyder's best work to date; but the best superhero film since The Dark Knight. The fight scenes are more exciting and brutal, the score from the excellent Tom Holkenborg injects excellent variances and nuances to each character and hits the beats of action setpieces beautifully (especially Wonder Woman's action sequences). The world building and characterisation are excellently structured, that expertly hit the emotional beats and flesh out character's arcs more fully; especially that of Cyborg and Steppenwolf, who get much needed love, attention and depth they were craving first time around. Zack Snyder expertly ensures that each of our heroes has an active role to play, which contribute to the story in a vital way, the payoff with some of the characters is extremely satisfying, without spoiling anything. In the brief moments Darkseid is in, he already makes a very menacing and imposing threat compared to the 24 or so films it took the MCU with Thanos. Darkseid already leaves his mark, tantalising the potential destruction and chaos he will bring upon the Justice League. Steppenwolf also has a new look, which is so much better and makes him look like an actual real threat and menacing for. Hopefully Zack Snyder has the opportunity to finish off his Justice League trilogy and deliver us the exciting story arcs being tantalised (especially the Knightmare sequence) and here's hoping we get to witness this one day! I am all in for #RestoreTheSnyderverse.", "Best COMIC BOOK movie ever made": "I smiled, I laughed, I screamed, I jumped...I cried...a lot. This movie has everything for a TRUE DC fan.

NEEDS!", "I will just say": "Do not EVER undersestimate the directror!This was entertaining and Zacks vesion I like mor e than any Avengers movie.Dark, as it should be.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League - Non-Spoiler Review.": "THE WALKTHROUGHIt is not a movie. It is nothing as compared to a movie, but, it is something else. I would say, hope, honor, but, it would be wrong to call it something else than the reality, the art, the masterpiece which we fans have waited for more than three and a half years.\nZack Snyder has given us the ray of what he could do but, it is upon us that we must stand for him and with him to accomplish the wonders he had in his mind while he first took the throne of the boss of DCEU under the shadow of WB.\nZack Snyder's Justice League portrays everything. It gives us the pinch of hatred, busy life of a father and not having enough time for his son, the restoration of faith of someone who turned his back on the world, the journey of the heroes forging as one in the past but, in present, it gives us the enchantment of light with darkness as there can never be a shadow casted where there's no light.\nThis version of Justice League proves that it is, it was, back in 2017, meant something and, today, it is as same as 2017 that today, it means as same as it could've in 2017. Zack Snyder proved that even if some group of people, sect of people, or even a race of people have issues in between them, whenever there's a greater bad comes through and tries to overturn the clock of the world, these people, no matter what their issues are, will fight back and do whatever it means to make the world feel the protection it deems and requires.\nAnd as far as the character-arcs have concerns, every character is beacon, a canon, and a complete set of variables that if you remove one, the constant becomes invalid.CHARACTER ARC - BATMAN\nWe have seen Ben Affleck portray Batman before but, this Batman is something else. It is nothing as compared to the one that we have seen in the Joss's version of Justice League as we have seen him scared and the one who runs for his life and even who says, at important moments, that I don't ... Not ... Like You. I mean, what?\nBatman, or I should say, Batfleck, is the one that is not putting together a team of heroes but is the one who is leading them through a catastrophe, and by catastrophe, I mean the fight they are trying to win within themselves.\nHe is the one that puts on the suit like a man who will do anything to take a chance as an absolute certainty to undo things that have happened, and he does.\nBatman, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is a pure treat of awesomeness, pureness, and epic enlightening of a character that was dark, unapologetic, and the one who ignored the world for 20 years fighting the criminals in Gotham but, this Batman, is the one who honors distant memory.\nBatman is full of technology and faith, this time, Ben Affleck portrays a different version of Batman. The one who's not afraid of anything and the one who's going to fight with the bad guys, as the boss of the Justice League.\nCHARACTER ARC - WONDER WOMAN\nFirst seen as an asset in easing the fight with Doomsday in the events of Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was badass that time, and she is badass in Zack Snyder's Justice League.\nShe is the one who forges history with present and, helps the others to fight for glory and righteousness.\nZack's vision had made Wonder Woman a beacon and a ray of hope for people amongst the DCEU, and not only for the Amazons but for the people that have harvested the lands of men and will do for the rest of their lives.\nWonder Woman is the one who protected the world while Superman was resting, she was the one who kept on the legacy of Superman to protect the world.\nWonder Woman, portrayed by Gal Gadot, has satisfied the visions of Zack Snyder and have proved that a woman can also bring fight where it's due.\nAs by the words of the Queen, herself. \"Daughters of Themyscira, show him your fear! - We have no Fear!\" - Wonder Woman has No Fear.CHARACTER ARC - THE FLASH\nEzra Miller's The Flash has everything. I have made this a non-spoiler review and will try to make it as long as possible but right now, I must say that The Flash is one of the canon characters of Justice League.\nHe has proven to be sarcastic, childish, genius, and moreover, a person who's lonely but have stepped up as a big guy to save the world, no matter what the consequences.\nZack Snyder's Justice League's version of The Flash is something else. It is full of bending the time, saving the people, making room for humor, and above all, a story which we have missed while watching the other version which is never valid to be called as Justice League, ever.\nAnd yes, he never pushes people away but, Parademons. He pushes Parademons away.CHARACTER ARC - AQUAMAN\nThe one thing that we, hardcore fans of the DCEU, missed was nothing but stories of every character that are as important as any other one that are trying to save the world.\nAquaman's story proves that he is as strong as anyone else but, with the team, he is even stronger to prove that he fights for what's right, and not like his brother, King Orm, who is trying to become a rebel against the world.\nAquaman proves to be as an ignorant madman at first, but, after fighting against Steppenwolf and seeing that he needs the league as same as the league needs him, he joins his forces with the League and becomes one of the most important part to fight and bask through the glory against potential threats that have posed against not only Atlanteans but against the people of the land, too.\nJason Momoa's Aquaman has proven its worth, with the story-arc that Zack Snyder had in his visions, Aquaman derives an equation which capacitates the league into such existing factor where all deems towards one goal and that is equal to save the world.CHARACTER ARC - SUPERMAN\nWe have seen the resurrection of Superman, back in 2017, but, that version is still baseless, useless, and even provokes the need to have been forgotten ever since it came to existence and into the world of DCEU.\nZack Snyder's Justice League provides a pivotal point where they aggravates to a situation which is as important as the resurrection of Superman and as anything else to help save the entire universe.\nThe story proves to be a beacon of deadly creatures coming forth and as by the words of Lex Luthor, \"Ding Dong - The God is Dead\" has made us already capable of thinking that there is another threat lurking towards the Earth to step forward and destroy it but, we never saw it in Joss's catastrophic attempt of making the Justice League.\nIn Zack's visions and in his motives, Superman is more of a human than an alien who deems to protect the earth but, with his death, which was certain, the danger lurked through the earth and why it did, is because of his death.\nHenry Cavill has done a superb job in making the Superman as real as the comic book does, as our imaginations do, and as our dreams do of looking towards an inspiration, a hope, and a glorious human being who is nothing but a simple person that is trying to perform a simple task, which is to protect the world.CHARACTER ARC - CYBORG\nRay Fisher is the one who has portrayed Cyborg in both the versions of Justice League (Joss's one is not Justice League, it is something else).\nCyborg has a story, the one we missed and the one we dreamed of seeing ever since Zack announced himself that Ray Fisher's Cyborg is canon to the storyline and to the visions he had while penning down the movie and making it a reality.\nVictor Stone may have become a Cyborg but, Zack Snyder has portrayed him more of a human than many of the other league members we might have seen in the 2017 version of Joss's direction.\nZack's direction had not only made Ray Fisher's Victor Stone a canon character but, it has also made him the heart of the movie because he is the one who has the ability or, the power or, the vision that can help save the world and salvage the remains of what he had.\nZack Snyder's Justice League prove that even if Victor Stone had turned into a Cyborg, a mechatronic robot, he will do anything to save the world, even if it is to give up his gifts that he have gained through the forging of the Mother Box's power with his mind and heart.Rating of the Movie, as compared to other CBM's\nWith Zack's vision ending on a nail-biting cliffhanger, the movie proves itself to be the charismatic, epic, and canon to the Knightmare timeline.\nZack Snyder's Justice League is not darker but, it is dark and has some moments where you might fall while screaming, where you might want to pull your hair and not help yourself to just say at the screen, \"Do it! Come on, Do it!\", and it is a movie where you might want to cry, weep, and even become joyous as some of the sequences will make you joyous.\nThis movie, as compared to other, many of the comic-book movies I have seen, envisioned, and have stored in my list of Top-10 comic-book movies, Zack Snyder's Justice League, comes at second, with my score of 9.8/10, only behind Batman: The Dark Knight, with score of an absolute 10.\nZack Snyder's Justice League is everything that a hardcore DCEU fan has dreamt and if you see it as a hardcore fan, you will start a movement with a cause to give us the answer to the biggest cliffhanger moment of the comic-book movie history.\nThis is it, This is everything. Zack Snyder's Justice League, is Everything.", "Snydercut is not to be watched it's to be an experience.": "What should I say? It's marvelous, and yaahh Zack did it and this is something else. It's different movie with more details. Soundtracks is Lit, BGM feel great in each scene. Battle Scenes and overall CGI were good. Cyborg draws most of the film, Ray Fisher does the character well. As before, Flash is an Intelligent & Powerful Teen Superhero. Literally he can save everybody. Now we can hope for a Falshpoint film. There's a little Serious & Badass Aquaman. As always Wonder Women did her things. Batman is working as usual. Alfred is great too. Batman is using some new Toys. There is a Badass Villain . His Armor is my favorite.

The first two parts maybe slow but I didn't feel the four hour length of the film because it's really entertaining, has great action, and has some good humor that does not feel forced.

He went through a terrible time and yet still came back to finish vision for the fans.( He didn't even get paid for it!)\nWhile long the movie more than earns it as every scene adds to the story and the changes he made from the Whedon version vastly improves the story. This includes better explained mythology, more in character dialogue and humorous scenes that's actually funny.\nHis changes made Stepphenwolf a far superior and actually intimidating villain with the looks to match.\nSnyder also fixes the Flash by making him a more complete character with jaw dropping Speed Force scenes.\nWhat Snyder fixed most of all was Fishers Cyborg. Snyder's vision was that Cyborg was the emotional core of the film but Whedon took it out. This time Cyborg has an origin with a compete heroes journey with better powers and dialogue that will give you goosebumps.\nThis is the Justice League we deserved and Snyder gave it to us.", "Unbearable slow motion and mourning songs all the time": "Title says enough.

Let me start by saying this, I hated BVS, I hated Whedons JL and I wasnt expecting this remake to be much better either. But let me tell you, this is everything Whedons JL was missing. It is 4 hours of pure adrenaline and just when you think it cant get any better, wait till the last 30 minutes of the movie! WOWI have watched 100's of DC's animated movies over and over, and every single old school DC movies. This is definitely in the top 3. It leaves you with wanting more.

Reviews saying this movie is too slow are from crack addicts who are unimpressed with caffiene. Seriously, the current generation of movie goers need a quick adrenaline fix with constant non-stop action to get a better endorphine high from this visual drug. The rest of us are enjoying a well crafted story that is also a visual feast as well as better action scenes with better acting to boot. Seriously, anyone who is saying this is just a little better than the other one is like a tone deaf reviewer of music.

I just finished watching this 4 hour marathon movie and all I kept thinking was, \"wow, it's already over?\". Four hours flew by because it's very, very good. And includes all the excellent scenes and story points that you cut out 4 years ago. If you guys truly want to compete with the MCU, then please follow Snyder's lead on this one.

A proper sequel to Superman's journey that started with Man of Steel and continued in Batman v Superman. The openning gave goosebumps as it started from where BvS ended and from another angle just like the opening scene in BvS. It gave each and every character proper time to shine. The bad thing is, this movie is 4 hours long. That's really bad. Because the experience is so intense that you can't take a little break until you finish the whole movie. Managing this time is probably the only bad thing about this movie. It was meant for the streaming service and could easily made as an ongoing series for easier viewing and fulfill fan's demand. For people who didn't understand, I have to say.... The story isn't finished yet. Zack Snyder needs the support to properly finish his vision/story/arc after which you'll get to understand the whole story and finally love the way zack snyder made these movies. It's visually stunning, full of easter eggs, insane scenes, lovely moments and of course so many subtle comedies unlike some other universes. A must watch movie and storytelling masterpiece.

This isn't (at least until the end... the end... the end... the end... is that the end? Ok. Oh, there's another one), but double the celluloid only changes this from a five star film to a six, based almost entirely on Cyborg being humanised. Could easily lose an hour by not having two minutes of establishing shots before any dialogue/action/another ending, which wouldn't have gained it another star, but would've made me more likely to watch it again at some point.\nIt's better than the theatrical cut, but not to the extent of all the 10 star reviews people are splooging all over the show.", "The Version We Should Have Received First": "When comparing to the 2017 Justice League, \"re-cut\" by Joss Whedon, it is very apparent this is the version we should have received. A more cohesive story with fleshed out characters, better visuals, action scenes, almost everything is improved upon.This version could have been trimmed down to about 3 and a half hours for a theatrical version, and the full 4 hours for a directors cut, but I don't know how much of the story you would compromise in doing so.

Joss, you should be executed for destroying something like this.", "Please, don't make the sequel.": "If you thought the Whedon movie was bad with its terrible directing, acting, storyline, accents and the worst CGI ever, you should see how Zack Snyder's Justice League #SnyderCut sucks for 4 hours straight with even worse of everything: music, CGI and over-dramatization and all of that shot in 4:3 ratio. Slow death.", "Emotional and Epic!": "Can't describe how good it was, loved every second of it. This is what I expected after Superman, this is the real deal!It completely succeeds in portraying the struggle, the emotions behind the action. Everyone was more invested, playing all the cards they had. I simply loved it.Completely recommend it! The photography is spectacular and the epic gothic winks here and there like the Paris statues or Gotham's gargoyles were superb. Also showing the characters in their life as they moved on was amazing. Diana in the museum, Barry applying for a job and so on. Truly a masterpiece!", "One of the best of the best.": "Warner Bros.

I adored everything Batman and Superman....until this new generation of garbage came out. How could a franchise completely ruin Batman and Superman movies over and over again? By the time the original version of this movie came out I had practically lost hope. They were destroying everything I loved about these characters with these crappy movies! And the justice league movie cemented that assumption into stone.But THEN...I saw the trailer for this version and I almost peed myself like a little puppy, I was so excited. It was dark and dramatic and everything I could have hoped for. FINALLY they made a DC film that rivals Marvel. DC has always had better characters and content than marvel... until it failed this recent generation. I can only hope that if there is every anymore DC films they keep Zack Snyder onboard. This is a masterpiece. Granted, it is extremely long but I don't care. It's perfect. Here's to a DC/Justice League revival.", "Fabulous movie": "This is even better than our expectations for the orig6 justice league. This movie brings back my faith in DC.

It gave us a full cinematic story that give each hero their time to shine. The writing and direction was so much better. I personally loved every second!", "EPPPIIIICCCCCC": "This is how you do a superhero movie. It felt different than others superhero movies. I guess because, finally, a director was able to create without hollywood executives telling him what he can and can't do. This shows that hollywood is completely disconnected from it's audience. This was an Epic adventure that told the full story of each character very well. That pacing was great for a 4 hour movie! I only had a few minutes of meh time, but it wasn't bad at all, more artistic. I was blown away with this film. EPIC is all I can say.", "It is good. Due to the circumstances of it being released it is overhyped. A good movie. But no master peice. Would like to see how it plays out and of it can be cleaned up.": "The movie is pretty good, personally I'm not a fan of the slowmo and some of the directing methods but this version has improved upon the previous version to the point of salvation.As a standalone movie it has a good few flaws, is a bit disconjointed and ironically for a 4 hour movie feels like it was rushed or done too soon (in universe). The character are not their comic book counterparts, batman is not batman, wonder woman is not wonder woman etc but that can be over looked as they are written as their own character not exactly the ones we think we know.The characters are more fleshed out and the villain is much better this time around. With more reasonable direction behind actions taken.With a bit more fleshing out and character driven movies this could create a strong movie universe if revisited. If this movie is the end it would be a shame.", "the film is many times better than what it was before": "If Justice League originally came out the way Zach wanted, I think we would have gotten the second part by now.

Plus it's divided into different parts so you don't have to watch the whole thing at once and pace yourself. Not a 10/10 tho but still valid and deserves praise.", "Roller Coaster Ride": "A great JL reboot plot helmed by the visionary himself. It was a true treat to watch.Graphics (Darkseid et al) could have been better, but with a limited budget what snyder has done is fantastic.", "I love a great story": "As i saw it, a man told you the story and said lets tell it right. He did the right things right and the wrong things so wrong they went right. Wished we saw more hint of future lantern in that dessert end scene but i thank you zack snyder for telling me a wonderous story(I enjoyed every single super hero film (except joker for my own reasons) even the 2017. But i see the different product of their times", "Restore the Snyderverse!!": "Honestly best superhero movie I've ever seen. So much depth in it. Zach Snyder is a literal genius when it comes to film making. Cyborg had possibly one of the best storylines I've ever seen. The fact that they cut out so much out of this movie that could've made it great the first time is a tragedy. I'm a DC fan and a marvel fan but this beats every marvel movie I've seen including infinity war and endgame which I loved. It might be because of the connection I have with this movie after waiting for it for 4 years but I'll say it all day this is my favorite superhero movie.", "This is Justice, let the Wizard Work!!!!!": "It's hard for me not to think of this movie as excellent! There are many points on this film that allow you to see into Zack Snyder's original vision and all you can say is \"We wish we got the Wizard's Film first\". Ray Fisher, to me, steals the show, and there's so many small elements with Henry Cavill's Superman that make you embarrass the fact that he was born to play this character! Ben Affleck's Batman is not telling stupid jokes, but rather stands true to the warrior detective he was meant to be! Gal Gadot hold true to the essence of Wonder Woman while Jason Momoa hits the mark as the pre-King of the Oceans! Ezra Miller to me was able to showcase his version of the flash (which I did not originally like in the Theatrical Version of Justice League) and now I am thrilled to see what he can do in the next Flash film! His comedic timing, and chemistry really brought Allen to life. What a treat this is for DC Comic Book fans and casual viewers alike! Warner Bros. Please let the Wizard Work, and leave him be!", "Great Story and Everything Else": "So many missing parts from 2017 version that makes all sense after watching these, so much Cyborg and Flash and will make you realize they were in the films, great action scenes and.

Forget the Josstice league!!", "Keep the Snyder versions of movies coming Zack !!": "Every movie so far that Zack has directed has been hands down amazing and this version of The Justice League was the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and definitely rating this a 10/10. Hoping to see more DC Snyder movies !!! #snyderverse", "Ok movie...a bit too long": "I really did dislike the 2017 version and this adds a lot to it its amazing it doubles the length given, while I see whats clearly added it doesn't feel like 2 hours extra", "Fast forward to hour three": "A four hour version that did NOT get interesting until after hour three.After almost falling asleep several times during hour one...and then two...and then three, it finally became a worthy film, however throwing it all away on a truly confusing 15 minute close out.I am a die hard DC fan, from Batman to Superman to Wonder Woman, and there are movies one will watch over and over -- this is not one. One time is enough.The \"villian\" looks like a Marvel character, who was fired from his last gig.Best line was when Barry Allen / Flash asks Bruce Wayne / Batman: \"Oh...and what is your super power, again?\"", "Absolutely Awesome": "This movie is absolutely epic.

Really hoping for a sequel. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Epic, one of The Best in the genre": "A beautiful conclusion to Zack Snyder's Superman arc, It will leave you wanting more", "Worth The Wait": "I never thought I would get to see this movie, but it actually happened. After being disappointed in that other mess that was released in theaters, this was so rewarding to see. This movie really gave Cyborg's character a great arc and he truly was the heart of the story. But what had me the most excited was The Flash. The Flash was the MVP for me. I can't wait to see The Flash movie. I hope Zack Snyder get to do a solo Wonder Woman film. Although this wasn't as epic and great as Batman vs Superman, this was still a good solid movie and worth the wait.", "Okay movie": "If you are not a diehard fan this movie isn't for you. It's very very long movie. Wasn't a huge fan because it drug on forever. Amazing acting story line was extremely slow. I wish it was written better but not much else to say.", "Im so happy, I want to cry. And I did. It was that good!": "Watching this made me feel so many things. I had goosebumps so many times. Meanwhile, I was so sad inside, thinking to myself... \"why wouldn't they show this to us in the first place?\" Its SOOOO GOOD!! <\\3 just the first 3 chapters was enough to win over the theatrical release by a thousand times!!!All I can say is, this movie could not get any better.This is what we wanted as fans. This is Zack Snyder.I hope he gets the support he needs to make more.We want more!I want more.", "A Superhero Epic": "A strong and coherent vision from Zack Snyder, tied in with some phenomenal action really makes you question why WB ever decided to go with Joss's version.You can really tell nothing was left on the cutting room floor. Whilst the majority of the film breezes by, there are a few scenes which slow the pace down, and a few which don't make much sense to the overall plot. That being said, these scenes do a great job teasing out more of this universe, I hope this isn't the last we see of Zack Snyder's vision.", "We deserve more": "#restorethesnyderverseWe deserve more!!

Great DC movie, now we can say Justice has been done with the Justice League", "Snyder cut is legit": "Makes a great case for why movies should be 4 hours long.", "Much better then expected! (Redemption)": "To anyone thinking this is the same movie as the 2017 cinema release, think again!\nI did not think it would feel so much different , yet it is and it is for the better.This cut was better in everything:\n-Story telling\n-Pacing\n-Fights\n-Setting the tone and modeWell done on fixing a mess is all I can say\nRedemption and Justice was served.", "Epic. All of it. #RestoreTheSnyderverse": "This is what it was meant to be. Its so clear that this was the sole artistic vision of one man.It took a bit into the first part for me to really get into it, but then I was sucked in for good. There were very few scenes that felt unecessary, otherwise everything contributed to character development and emotional story beats that made me care for each member of the Justice League by the end.The pacing felt very natural for the most part, there were some things that were dwelled on for a bit too long but the story and visuals are actually coherent this time and everything Zack was going for made sense. I only saw the 2017 cut once in the theater and just didn't really give a crap for what I had seen, but this was something else. Even some of Zack's scenes that were used in the theatrical cut felt brand new. That revamped score by Junkie XL was fantastic and so euphoric I loved it. There are so many splash page shots throughout the film, the new color-grading of the cinematography was gorgeous. Zack's signature desaturated look was back and used effectively in conjunction with color to balance out the visuals. The 1:33 ratio worked very well for me showing more of the vertical screen, but there were many moments when I wanted it to fill my screen where I just switched to the zoom in option on the TV so the sides expanded out to the edges for the 16:9 ratio and it worked out great.The heart of this story is about family, loss, and reconciliation for these characters. Especially Victor Stone and Barry Allen, who finally have complete story arcs in this cut that really make us feel for the Cyborg and the Flash during the end battle sequence. Their stakes in the fight were the biggest, and getting their due in this definitive cut of the film was much needed. Bruce Wayne's arc that comes full circle from BvS is fulfilling with his faith restored in humanity, making him the Batman we all know and love again. Clark Kent comes back being more certain about his purpose on Earth and where he fits in as Superman. Diana learns the history her people were involved in and how to honor them as the Wonder Woman, and Arthur comes to terms with who he represents for Atlantis and how best he could take up that mantle while being the Aquaman. Each one of these characters goes through an arc that makes us feel for them when they finally develop a sense of camaraderie and come together to defeat Steppenwolf. Now Steppenwolf in this cut is a real dimensional villain with a sensible motivation. He is in debt to Darkseid, and is on a quest to pay it off while proving his worth to Darkseid, DeSaad and the rest of Apokolips. There are a few moments when I even felt bad for Steppenwolf, knowing that he had an insurmountable task at hand. Ultimately, the additional dialogue scenes this 4-hr runtime allowed really helped the characterization to breathe and develop, all of which was absent from the theatrical cut.This is Zack Snyder's epic, magnum opus. You can see the sheer heart and effort throughout the whole movie. I'm on board if there's any chance of Zack coming back to complete the sequels, but with the budgetary and time commitment implications for him and the whole cast, it does seem unlikely at this point. I'll be rewatching Zack Snyder's Justice League many times, it was so satisfying to see this film come to fruition in it's true form from what Snyder had intended while filming it in 2016.", "A Glorious Movie!!": "This movie is amazing!!! Zack Snyder had delivered a masterpiece again! This is truly the greatest comic book movie ever made. The action was fantastic, the CGI was beautiful, the actors were awesome especially Ray Fisher and Ezra Miller. This is everything I've wanted in a JL movie, and I really love that each character gets their own fleshed out stories. Steppenwolf was finally a great and menacing villain, and the Knightmare scene was magnificent!! Cyborg is definitely the heart of the movie, and his story made me cry a few times. This movie is a solid 10/10! WB would be stupid not to restore the snyderverse, this movie needs sequels, and Zack needs to continue his DC movies, WE NEED TO SEE JL 2 and 3!!! So happy to finally see this beauty after the horrible Joss Whedon 2017 cut.", "The masterpiece we deserve!!!": "Absolutely outstanding, period. Storyline good articulated without black holes on it... Just perfect. I'm waiting all the movies that this one presented in the landscape. This is a great time for DC and its multiverse.", "An epic story with epic shots": "Beautiful, emotional, epic, serious, deep, smart, big film.", "Boring....": "Feeels like a rerun. A few extended scenes but still wacky.... Original version was much better.", "Finally marvel has competition!": "This is the best movie Zack Snyder has ever made! Speaking from a lifelong comics fan who once had aspirations of writing comics and worked a comic stores growing up before ultimately moving onto my true passion (Music)... I've long watched DC comics toil in obscurity compared to marvel....BEFORE THIS MOVIE. This is the first time they've told the right story in the correct way with the correct amount of realism and attention to detail that has been much needed #Thank you. If they stay on this course D.C. Comics can become a true competitor... DC comics has a wealth of properties and characters that can be made into a Cinematic universe if you have the right eye and know which characters to spotlight. Well done Mr. Snyder! Not since the Dark Knight Films have I been interested in DC comics more than today.I had a recording session the next morning... But I still binge watched the entire thing overnight well done indeed!Andre Xcellence!", "Long live Snyderverse!!": "Amazing!!! Same story but the execution is so good. It felt like watching animated DCEU Movie. So much heart and love. The ending just left me craving for more.", "Decent movie, horrid version": "Zack Snyder took a decent movie and reduced it to ashes. Narrow screen, black & white??? Seriously? Zack, please have a look at a calendar. This is not 1947!", "Simply the best!!!": "Short and sweet this movie wasn't made for the critics but for the fans and boy does it live up to the hype we'll done everyone for making this project a reality.", "This what snyder has here works very well.": "I found this film's length to far more justified than you would assume upon hearing about a 4 hour superhero movie. With four hours split in to about 6 chapters you have many points to turn it off and save the rest for later without really interrupt ling the flow of the film. Though, I find that wanted to keep going and finish the whole film at once. The length of movie allows far more breathing room for each character to develope, allowing you to grow more emotionally attached and engaged in the story. The main set pieces of the film come together with beautiful reimagining of the later versions ending. As a long time fan of the comics I'm glad to finally see these characters represented the way they are in this film, and I believe more people would enjoy this film than whoever is reading this would likely imagine. We need a sequel as soon the cast and crew can be ready.", "If you like movies filled with action this is for you.": "The fighting scenes we're cool, dialogue was mostly horrible and cringey and most of the scenes we're fully cgi.

The characters are much more fleshed out, dynamic, and behave like themselves without the out of place sometimes sexual jokes Whedon added in his version. Steppenwolf, a villain I laughed at and despised, is terrifying and has a great motivation.I also enjoyed how connected this film was to Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Wonder Woman. It felt a part of that universe and was consistent with continuing those storylines. Something the theatrical cut miserably failed at.I compare this to The Avengers in the sense that after much worldbuilding from solo films we get an epic team up movie that brings them all together in a grandiose way. It is 4 hours, but it doesn't feel like 4 hours. I think what helped with that was the separate Parts that give you a chance to breathe and take a break if you need to.I am disappointed that the story will not continue but what a way to end with a bang.", "Zack Snyder's Justice League: Us United": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is chaptered into a prologue, six parts, and an epilogue. Think of it as like a comic book limited series compiled into a cinematic trade paperback. The plot never feels meandering and all the characterization along the way pays off in the drama of the epic final battle. By the end, nothing in the film feels extraneous, except maybe the long epilogue which largely sets-up originally planned sequels. Zack Snyder does not make your typical superhero movies. While those can be very enjoyable and fun, Snyder takes superheroes to a whole other level of art. I am absolutely certain Zack Snyder's Justice League will be remembered as a cinematic masterpiece.To maximize your Justice League experience, I suggest at least (re)watching Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) before it, but for the full effect also (re)watch Man of Steel first. If SZ's JL is too much for you to binge in one sitting, then break it down into parts. (Between Parts 3 and 4 is a good break point for watching the film in two sittings.) HBO Max has these films (and a whole lot more), and it is available to subscribe on a monthly basis.Parental Guidance: Some of the action scenes are bit more violent than most superhero films, with some blood and a bit of (mostly alien) gore. There are a few occurrences of profanity. But I think most 13 year-olds would probably be ok with watching this movie.", "This is a love letter to longtime DC fans": "This is the live action Justice League movie we have been waiting for all these years. This was a love letter to those long time DC fans who have invested years into these characters and stories. From the setup of Superman's death screams to the reveal of Martian Manhunter were epic. Cyborg's story finally told within the proper context to give the emotional depth and much needed audience perspective. Flash's actions, especially at the end, cements his status within this pantheon of new gods. Wonder Woman just being the bad ass muscle needed to balance Batman's weaknesses. The only character that was kind of short-shifted was Aquaman but he got his own solo cool movie so I'm good with that choice. I would love to see this version of Justice League turn into a miniseries on HBO MAX with the Knightmare/Flashpoint storylines. The animated movies do a great job there but seeing this within this context would be incredible and probably just a bit too much to ask. Let me just say, thank you Zach Snyder for allowing me to watch a Justice League movie that reflects these characters and not what one studio just thinks the most people will understand and digest. Thank you!!!", "Could be Perfect": "Could be Perfect! I miss some (not all) of the funny dialogues like the ones between Batman and Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg. I also miss the music Everybody Knows.", "Trumps the original.": "The original has nothing on this. Everyone who have seen the original Justice League by Joss Whedon, must see this beautiful Synder cut.", "What wrong with you warner brothers!!!!!!": "After this beautiful movie !! .. i just want to say To zack THANK YOU SO MUCH !!! ... and for warner brother go to the fu**ing hell and let zack do whatever he want from now and on", "We need justice league 2 NOW!!": "After this movie .. i just want to say THANK YOU ZACK!!! ... and for WARNER BROTHERS go to the fu**ing hell and let zack do whatever he want from now and on", "Waiting for second chapter!)": "Awesome!P.s. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther looks like weedy Joker.", "Over-hyped and drawn out scenes": "First of all, I like other Zack Snyder movies however, about half of this movie is essentially what is seen on Joss Whedon's version which makes for a lot of skippable moments if you've seen it. The rest of the movie introduces more character development and the build up to a villain that was not shown in the original movie and this might not get another film. The IMAX film ratio isn't really suitable for home movie streaming. The beginning of the movie has an annoying sound score where Superman is screaming that keeps repeating and too many scenes that are slowed down. A lot of these scenes for Aquaman seem poorly edited and has a very cringe scene where someone is randomly singing to him that adds no value to the story. The parts that are praisable, is that, we finally get to see Ray Fisher's character development and what Cyborg is really capable of, this now makes me notice how very little he is shown in Whedon's version. Barry Allen finally gets a more sensible development instead of being forced to seem funny and that awkward scene with laying on Wonder Woman isn't included because it wasn't needed at all. I had problems with the soundtracks again everytime a character was shown doing anything on-screen, the repetitive soundtracks kept playing over them. It's a one-time watch for me, I likely won't sit through this movie again.", "Sublime": "Beautiful, emotional, gripping, exciting, worth it.That is all.", "The Greatest superhero movie ever made IMO": "This movie is a different movie to to 2017 version and just amazing from top to bottom. It hits home in more of a grounded way using ancient mythology that we can relate to in real life. Thats what makes this special.Viewers will need to also realise that this movie was the beginning to a three parter and for a movie of this caliber to be so good, give the back stories it did and deliver on a such a level, That's amazing. Yes it had 4 hours to deliver backstory and emotion to why they must come together but this is what WB needed to bring these characters to life and using pop culture references to sell merch did not work.I wish I could have seen more of an impact of the anti life equation and what would have had been but it leaves us wanting more for restoring this universe.I don't compare this to other franchises because these DC characters only deserve to be compared to themselves and this is the best iterations of these characters we have seen on the big screen.", "Everything I wanted and more": "Now that I have my thoughts together. I'll share what I thought of the film. The main story still remains the same(more or less). But what the #SnyderCut does is add context and meaning to the scenes which were devoid of in the Josstice League.\nA lot of scenes have been added which give reasons as to why each character acts the the way they do. Cyborgs storyline is done 'justice'. Throughout the film there are moments which make so much better sense than whatever joss did with.\nThe heroes are portrayed as the heroes they are. None of the scenes make this version feel dragged or laggy. The score and VFX is so good.\nThe fact that they managed to accomplish this in 7 months and on a minimal budget deserves to be applauded.\nThe film is definitely much more light hearted and hopeful than the earlier films which isn't a bad thing but something people criticised Snyder for the lack of in his earlier films.\nAll in all I'd give it a 10/10\nLove you and Thank you for this Zack Snyder. You truly are my fav director", "These are the kind of movie that all superhero fans need and deserve to see.": "This new version is absolutely great. 4 hours, yes ... but I never felt bored.

Gracias Zack por hacer que el Universo DC brille de nuevo. Realmente disfrut\u00e9 esta pel\u00edcula. La primera vez, fue decepcionante...trama muy simple e infantil y sin que tuviera mucho valor.

(As i have been following the Snyder cut movement all along!)Still there were many new surprises along the wayI couldn't than enough Zack Snyder for bringing his to us after so much he has gone through.I will be watching this masterpiece again and again like i have been watching MoS, BvS & WW.\nLong live the Trinity.And yes... we want this journey to continue.

OKEY!!!!, i drove over 4 hours to watch the movie ... it was \"above average\" & this is coming from a HUGE Batman & Superman fan ( been reading the comics since the mid 70ies, then i heard the news about the Ultimate Edition, that was the Movie Batman & Superman Deserve.\nwhen Justice League news came .. i was practically jumping with joy, then again .... the news of Zack leaving the movie after his Tragedy, & Whedon taking over was a little scary, again ... a 4 hours drive .....the movie was ( fun ) since it included all my favorite super heroes, but it felt Wrong.... just Wrongi backed the \"Snyder's Cut\" since it's infancy, now bear with me a little, i'm not like the Ultimate Fan of Zack Snyder's work, for example i find \"Sucker Punch\" to be disturbing, 300 was \"okey\", his choice of Wonder Woman isn't the best ( until now btw ).BUT!!, when it comes to DC, the man knows what he's Doing!! i watch ZSJL three times already .... the movie is a masterpiece from whatever angle you look at it from. MOS was Great, BVS was missing something ( 'til the Ultimate Edition came ), Justice League was a different Movie 'til he got to release his Vision.maybe the WB suits should back the EF down & give him the creative freedom he needs to give the fans what they deserveThe Flash gets the respect he deserves, not the silly kid from the 2017 Theatrical Release,Cyborg, i mean WOW!!!! the story of the single mom alone deserves a \"Hat's off\"Aquaman gets in the truck & heads to the beginning of his Solo MovieLast but not Least: Ben Affleck, i've been a fan of the Batman since the mid 70ies, seen everything that has Batman on it...... hands Down, your Batman/Bruce Wayne is the best one by far ....& now ..... that we Saw what his Vision was ... it'll be a crime not to \"BEG\" him to finish his whole vision to the DCEU, he really did a GREAT JOB with this Story#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Wow just wow": "Finally we are being treated like adults & given the version of the film that we all deserve.\nFantastic is not even good enough.\nWhen will movie studios finally release that it does not matter how long the film is as ( 4hours-10hours ) as long as the films good.\nI would much rather a film like this 4hours long that entertain's & explains rather that cut version's that leave you just like what is going on.\nWell done absolutely fantastic.", "Best version.": "Zack snyder is a genius I would off prefer to sit and enjoy this masterpiece on imax , but due to actual days is a further dream, very cool movie make me feel the goosebumps when I was a kid .", "The best DC movie so far": "I think that it was the best possible work for such a big project.I have to admit that the script was kind of poor and I am not that big fan of the Snyder's direction(which this time it was decent) and I noticed that no one had a story this deep as Ciborg (except Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman)but from now on I have only plusses. Very cool action and interesting the story of Stepenwoulf and I liked very much the Wonder Woman action and stunts.I was really impressed of the photography.At last, I was having a great time watching the movie and and I was really impressed by the work of the director and the CGI.", "Zzzzz": "If you like no story and bad acting, this is for you. The fact that people gives this 10/10 is just incomprehensible. The lack of storyline and relatable characters is astonishing. If you are sixteen, I get it. Then it's undoubtedly a 10/10. If you'd expect things to actually have content, then its not for you.", "The bells been rung for JL part 2 & 3": "After watching this movie, I have to say that it surpasses all my expectations. The movie seems like a love letter written for all the comic book fans. 4 hours runtime & I still want to see more of the same from DCEU.

Zack finally gets to finish his vision for the film and we all now get to experience it. The 2017 justice league feels like a soul-less showreel devoid of any real character development or meaningful story threads and it was so noticeably different that hordes of fans campaigned for a version that was, at that point, only rumoured to exist. Make no mistake, this is an entirely different film...better in every way. The characters now have room to breathe. They develop with meaningful arcs worth investing in and it's all woven together by beautiful cinematography, an exhilarating score and easily some of the finest action set-pieces ever to grace screens. I didn't think I would ever get to see this. I had come to terms with that universe being cut short before it had the chance to truly shine. I'm still shocked it has happened and I'm so thankful to everyone involved. Having seen this, there really is no better way forward than to #RestoreTheSnyderVerse. This has set a new bar for comic book adaptations and nothing wb has planned out would come anywhere near this.\nThis film is an absolute triumph.", "ZS version is so much better.": "Yes is a bit long. But 4 hours of the movie passed like a normal movie. The scenes with cgi are changed in better. The story of the superman now makes sense. The screen ratio is a bit strange but after 15 minutes you will get use to it.", "Dragging to death": "Not sure what people see this with high rates (even for DC fans), it's super slow and dragging to death, we totally could see what's coming but it'll only come after a lot of slow motions, and there are some commercial ad's which are too obvious to ignore.Not much of synergy in this league, there's no story or interaction between almost anyone, other than they fight the bad guy... It's ambitious to have everything in one movie - gather each member and defend the earth (heroism rather than anything to do with justice btw).I even had some impression this is more of a power point presentation type of movie that, makes each chapter clean and over comprehensive. They seem really worry if people don't get any word or action so there are many explanation in between.The ending is so weird and even dragging longer, when you think it's over now (the time when Luthor showed up), it then lasted for another scene, then another. It's better to download it at home to drag the movie while watching it, you could finish in 30min maximum!", "This is how you compete with marvel": "First of all, this movie was an A, the last version was a mess, at the time I thought it was ok but after seeing the Snyder cut, this was a totally different movie and it was awesome. What I as a fan want is more of these actors playing these characters in an interconnected universe. Wonder Woman 1984 was Meh, it was a sideways film that cheapened an awesome casting and character. What is wrong with this studio? I won't pay to see a recast Superman either. I still have Marvel after all. It's a shame because Superman is so much more, and Henry cavil is the perfect casting for that character. If Dc wanted to succeed, the next release should be mon of steel 2", "NOW THIS IS JUSTICE LEAGUE AND THE DCEU!": "Zack Snyder is a mastermind. This movie is a masterpiece, it's so beautifully shot, and the amount of depth and emotion in the writing makes you truly understand what the characters are going through. I didn't think I could sit through 4 hours in one sitting, but I actually did because I couldn't stop watching and in fact, I WANTED MORE.\nZack is so knowledgeable in the cinematic art, you can tell when he talks in interviews about his favorite movies the way he describes the aesthetics; and he's knowledgeable in the comic book content. So together with his vision, as extravagant as it is, he makes it happen. This movie shows that these companies (WB), need to let their directors have most of the creative control. After watching this, you'll ask yourself how the hell did WB release that original one? This movie shows that Joss Whedon cut out like 90% of the cast, and wrote such a boring watered down story in the old original version.This movie brought all the characters equal screen time, proper dialog and interactions, gritty action-packed fights, and raw emotional scenes that made this a true comic book movie.10/10. You must watch it!", "Embarrassing": "Truly embarrassing and annoying. One star for the visual artists involved, maybe another half star for the tiny bit of amusement proffered by the Flash kid. Beyond that, it was a carnival of clich\u00e9s, poorly presented. The nauseatingly lame scenes of attempted emotional manipulation abetted by hackneyed symphonic swelling, the painful illogic in the battles, the many absurd moments of Vogue-worthy posing and gazing whose only merit was their giving an occasional break from the dully delivered dialogue seemingly written by ten year olds to appeal to five year olds - it all added up to a grotesquerie of excess and artlessness. Plus, if I ever see one more super-thing land in a dramatic crouch and pause a moment before completing their urgent task so that the camera can absorb all of the contrived \"coolness\" on display, it will be WAY the freak too soon.", "No review!": "Just please give us more!

Every detail in this film is in its place, all plot twists and turns take place. Of course, making a film after reading critics for a couple of years is not difficult, but not the point. The film turned out to be wonderful, in my opinion a solid dozen from a movie-comic book lover and my recommendation.", "Jared Leto": "The movie for sure is better than the 2017s but the problem was Jared Leto he was just in one scene and I also didn't convince him as joker.", "Not aasam...": "Film story was simple as in classical previous films on epic subjects electronically fights were as usual, so to say couldn't inspire\nMt.", "Better but...": "In reality this movie is better than Justice league but in my opinion its still a low quality movie...\nStory is not that good, and sometimes its really visually a mess!\nThe most positive improvement was the rehabilitation of Steppenwolf...", "Fantastic in every way!": "The story arcs, character building, and cinematography all made this such an engaging and entertaining film. It had more rawness to it vs. the very \"comic booky\" feel of the original version. The action and CGI wowed me and the character development created a few emotional moments for me. So well done and I agree with others who say to absolutely have Zack helm all of DC's films moving forward. Bravo!!", "DC have come back": "Everything was awesome and perfect except acting skill and dialouge delivery of Wonder Women. Hats off to Cyborg. He really nailed it. Background Score, VFX, direction were on another level. This movie deserves more than it got. DC has to focus on actress of Wonder Women. Her English is worse than a small non-native kid. By the way, I didn't find any other lackings.", "DC's Justice League Finally Gets Justice": "Zack Snyder's version is definitely on par with the DC's slightly more irreverent tone than other friendly superhero movies. The rich colours of Joss Whedon's version are toned down, and more time is taken to give each of the characters more contextual richness which overall elevates the quality of the film. Don't forget there are a couple of cameo surprises which are more than certain to set the stage for (a) sequel(s). It's the longest film I've watched, but you get a sense of satisfaction that THIS IS IT.", "Everything you want it to be and more": "Zack Snyder has clearly put his heart and soul into creating this film epic. The action, the emotion, the characters, the story, the visuals, the music. Everything has been given so much care and attention.\nThe film is inspirational and leaves you wanting so much more. The runtime is completely warranted and you never feel like it drags or loses focus.\nThe fact that this was so heavily demanded and hyped up by the fan base could potentially have created an unachievable level of expectation, but it's quite the opposite as Snyder has delivered so much more than expected.This is a triumphant achievement of cinema and a true vindication for the fans, and for Deborah & Zack Snyder who were truly wronged by the studio that butchered their film during a time of great loss and grief for the family.\nIt desperately needs to have the sequels made and I don't see the fans letting this go anytime soon.\nRestore the Snyderverse!", "It's an explanation, want, art and what we deserve": "Like it's just so beautiful, the cinematography ofcourse, the direction. shots are like art, you can take any frame of it and make it your desktop background, the music is damn and the 2017 justice league is nothing compared to it, loved it man.", "An Epic Phenomenal Master Piece": "This is everything you wanted and more. Id say its even better than \"Logan\" and gets close to the Nolan movies. A must watch!", "Superhero Movies cannot get better!": "The film has the same overall story. But it is still a 100x better.

Superb actors who fit their characters perfectly. Such a joy to watch these magnificent superheroes on screen. The villains are menacing, and the threat feels real here.

A few years ago I watched the older Josstice League which was largely incoherant and frustrating to watch, but this one was cohesive and easily understandable. Pacing was good, good action scenes spaced out between character development. I was more interested in the characters , Cyborg Flash and Wonder Woman all have bigger roles and you empathize with them more. There's a lot of slow mo but they made the action better, not detract from it.This isn't some oscar winner avant garde movie but it's a fun watch and perfectly fine way to spend your day.", "Much better than theatrical version": "It did its job setting up future stories and slowed down a bit to make story better.

All of the corny jokes was taken out and the characters were way more grounded. Zack's visual vision oozes on this film and some shots were breathtaking. All I got to say was I felt angry at WarnerBros for initially hiring Whedon to butcher Zack's vision just because they wanted to rush the film out back in 2017. They should have just let the man finish his work since he was still grieving for the lost of his daughter. If they did I believe this 2021 Synder cut would have made bank for WarnerBros.

The Final battle is much more majestic: Batman actually doing something this time around , Superman being badass (man he surely slain Steppenwolf), and we also get a glimpse of the Flash trademark Speedforce. Well, eventough the story is a big triumph, but it's not without it's flaws. There's a noticeable CGI Mess especially when Henry Cavill hold Lois Lane dead body during Cyborg's vision and I think there's a couple of scenes that should have been better, ex: It's more effective if the scene stop when Martha Kent had her eyes glow red for the sake of epilogue tease rather than being fully revealed as Martian Manhunter from the beginning it's kinda odd that if he exist then what is the satisfying explanation to give about Martian Manhunter absence during the fight againts Steppenwolf?This movie felt ambitious from the start and it display a lot of Snyder's slow wo trademark, some people may not like the style and the length, but it's enough to satisfy a comic book enthusiast like me. And Yes, we want more.Cheers", "Finally something that could compete with the Marvel Universe": "THIS was the Justice League my childhood deserved. I won't watch another one unless it's from Zack Snyder.", "A Masterpiece and Perfect Comic Book Film.": "Every scene starting till end was amazing. The remarkable score from Tom Holkenborg and great cinematography added more flavors in this movie.\nDialogues with deep meaning and superb acting by talented cast added cheery on the top.\nThe division of movie in parts gave Taratino style vibes and in 4 hours it shown us a clear image of interesting plot which connects with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\nThe Snyder Cut is basically a love letter for Comic Books and DC fans from Zack Snyder. This film has a potential to get a sequel so that viewers can explore the world of Snyder's vision and his DCverse.", "Goosebumps guaranteed, a whole new cbm experience.": "It's a 4 hour epic grandeur. All the characters make sense. Erza and Ray are the heart and that black superman is freaking awesome. Batfleck's batman is the best batman and the wonder woman is full of charm. 5 years of waiting was worth it and Zack Snyder is a visionary and a daring director . Those movie deservers that bloody R-rating. I hope the higher ups utilise someone like Zack for future shared universe and don't end up being called as the clueless higher up idiots.", "Comic to Movie": "As a DC fan, nothing could be more amazing then seeing the comic line story comes to screen as a movie and did an amazing job. Sat 4 hour continuously, and did not feel bore at all. The only is missing that there are no further movies to continue the story of ZS JL.", "Better than the 2017 version, but far from being perfect": "Going into this movie, I really just had one hope for this; to be better than the 2017 version. It was. I will start by discussing the positive things I noticed.For one, this movie actually gives a strong character arc. In the 2017 version, there was no real introduction to the heroes and no explanation for Steppenwolf's plans. I thoroughly enjoyed the story telling in this as well. One of the biggest problems I had with the original Justice League was the terrible plot writing. This version was actually written much better and had a story that flowed and made sense. It still wasn't perfect, but it was far better than the previous Justice League. Another thing I really liked was the changes from the old one. There are a significant amount of things that are either changed from the 2017 film or completely added, and I found these scenes to be the best moments in the movie because they were fresh and new and actually interesting. There were also a few surprises in this that made me happy, to say the least. No spoilers so I will not explain on that any further...To continue on the positive things, I really enjoyed the storyline with Darkseid. He was a really powerful and interesting character that was not the main villain in the movie but certainly made a big impact, and I am looking forward to his potential return in a potential sequel to this. Darkseid was completely removed from the 2017 version so it was very nice to see him in this and for Snyder to actually do a great job strategically placing him in the movie and explaining everything we need to know about him, Steppenwolf, and their plans. The last thing I really liked about this Snyder Cut was the action. Overall, the action was far better than the 2017 version in many ways. Steppenwolf was a much better villain and I felt like each character had their heroic moment in this, where I didn't feel they had much of any moments in the previous one. A lot of the action scenes were improved from the old film and I was impressed with the little details in the action and the extended scenes that actually made it compelling.Unfortunately, there are just as many negative things I found with this version of Justice League. The most blaring issue I had with this from start to finish was the CGI. I understand that this is literally the director's cut, but the CGI looked pretty bad at times, as if I was back 10-15 years playing an old video game rather than watching a live action film in 2021. Darkseid especially looked very Playstation 2 like in a scene, making him look like the villain you may fight in a boss battle in some old video game. It just didn't match the image quality you see in other movies of this time and many older ones. The poor CGI and effects definitely distracted me at times but the CGI was not so bad that it ruined my experience at all. Another problem I had with this is the fact that it was 4 hours long for really no reason. I have seen other long movies, such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy or Avengers Endgame or even Avatar, and this cut was definitely the longest I have ever seen. But my issue was that the extended run time was not necessary. Much of the extended time was used on character introductions, origins, and story telling that could have been avoided by simply making other DCEU filsm prior to this. For example, one of the reasons that the MCU is doing so well is because of the balance between the solo movies and the team up movies. This movie really had no connection to the Aquaman movie and there is no previous introduction to Cyborg or Flash and it just felt like this Snyder Cut was multiple movies put together. It ended up being a lot. Avengers Endgame, for example, was long but it had a story that flowed naturally and did its thing. Here, the story flowed but it was a lot of small moments with characters that I feel wasn't necessary. Arguably the biggest issue for me was the fact that this movie has a lot of similarities and same scenes as the 2017 version. I read a lot of reviews saying that this was a completely different movie. I will tell you straight up, that is a lie. This movie is pretty much 2 hours from the 2017 movie, with some tweaks in the story and action, and 2 hours of introduction, character development, and Darkseid's origins. It is just a lot. And I personally expected there to be many more twists and unexpected events. Sadly, if you saw the 2017 Justice League, you pretty much know what is going to happen throughout the movie. It is the same exact storyline except this version includes Darkseid. I really hoped for a much better final battle and many more original scenes than what we got. In the end, we got a final battle almost shot for shot identical with literally one or two changes that really weren't all that amazing and a movie filled with scenes I had already seen. One other thing, this movie still lacked emotion. Once again, I really did not find myself emotionally invested in any character in this movie. Despite the better story telling, Snyder was unsuccessful in making me emotionally attached to any of these heroes and unsuccessful at making me like Ben Affleck's Batman.Overall, this movie is better than the 2017 version but this is far from being a perfect movie. The plot, story, characters, and CGI all had flaws and I still don't think this is even worthy of being in the same conversation as any Avengers movie. All four Avengers movies, in my opinion, were far better than this. However, I would argue that this is one of the best DCEU movies. In my personal opinion, my top three DCEU movies remain the same; Aquaman, Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman. But this definitely takes that 4th spot. There are a lot of good things to enjoy about this movie. Although not many, the surprises are pretty awesome. Sadly, I really wanted to love this movie and I cannot. It is good, but not considered one of the greats. Zack Snyder did his thing and I am thoroughly impressed with his work on this, and I believe you will be too. But to say this is a completely new movie would not be true. Also, saying this is the greatest movie in the world would be so far off. I have seen many people over hyping this movie. Like I said, it was good. But not epic. I wish it was. I give this an 8.2/10.", "This movie is a Master Piece": "Jl is a masterpiece of cinema, wonderful, it was the movie that every fan deserves", "The Justice League we deserved.": "This movie was great. Yes it was long, but absolutely worth it. So many things were explained. Joss Whedon's version never existed in my opinion. Even the effects are better in this version. I took off 1 star because there were too many Lois Lane scenes, excessive slo mo, and that weird singing scene in the beginning that didn't add the the value or understanding of the movie. Honestly, cutting that stuff out may have made it a normal run time. The end scenes made up for it.", "Definitely a lot better and coherent": "TBH I enjoyed the original as well and I was willing to put the issues aside. But this one didn't require me to do that and it was just overall coherent and and extremely enjoyable experience.

The Batman got redemption over the humiliation in the theatrical version of Josh Wedon, he's now overpowered with this energy gauntlet and ridiculous scenes for the Batman in the theatrical version has been erased.

Easily 9.2/10 from me.", "Too long": "This film was extremely full of itself & film editors exists for a reason. There are a lot of scenes that really added nothing to the story line, also was the Flash really faster than lightning I wouldn't know he was basically slowed down in all his action scenes!

But I've always felt more moved by the DC characters and they felt kinda more mythological than their counterparts in Marvel. What Snyder has done is to somehow brought this feeling and made this movie at a much higher level. I'm not claiming that this is a perfect comic book movie, but it certainly tries to be and damn near does it. It feels more connected and logical than the theatrical version. Snyder has redeems the DCU and it leaves us wanting more. The 10 rating both for the movie and what it has achieved by getting a release on demand and faithful to the directors vision. It dares to be different and GOD is it different!!! Loved it", "JL 2 and 3 is a must now!": "We have been waiting for such movie for years now. Thanks to Zack Snyder, and us, the fans, we've got what we finally deserve. This is truly an amazing movie. I really hope JL 2 and 3 will be 4hrs long too. Snyderverse is full of detailed storyline.

All of the scenes actually made sense in comparison, the character arcs didn't feel like they were full of holes, and even set up for things that could, or really should happen in the future. If they don't do something with the plot lines given in the movie, it'd be a real shame. Let's just say all of the problems with the original movie, are fixed in this one. All of the characters are fixed, with the exception of Barry Allen in my opinion but that can be overlooked on a count of the rest of the movie being done so well. If someone were to find a problem with watching the whole movie in one sitting, it's set up so it can easily be watched in parts.

It might be a bit too long, so you probably need to split it into 2 sittings. Some changes have been done and extra scenes added. Is it better than the theatrical cut? Yes, it certainly is a different beast. The bad color filters are gone and effects have been very much improved, like the digital erasing of the moustache of Superman and Steppenwolf is totally redone. Cyborg and The Flash have more to do and more of an arch benefits them since neither have their own standalone movies yet, like the others. The ending might feel a bit tacked on, but the Joker stuff was pretty cool. Could the movie be a bit too indulging? Perhaps, but it is the version I will go back to.", "Much better than the first one.": "As i said, its wayy better than the theatrical cut. The plot takes its time to unfold, there is character development, Steppenwolf's character isn't flat as he has a different and better motivation ,Flash's and Cyborg's characters get a proper origin story and Batman isn't soft. It proves that Snyders vision would be amazing. Lets hope that the studios learned their lesson and let him make the sequels that this movie set up, by ending in a cliffhanger. #restorethesnyderverse", "Mediocre at best": "Ok that was rough...The film improves on the original cut in some respects and shoots itself in the foot in others. The character development is much appreciated for Cyborg, but so-so for the others. I still have no idea what version of Batman Snyder is going for but boring is apparently a thing and a man without a plan. Definitely not a film for people who aren't comic fans because Snyder doesn't seem to care about world building at all. The visual effects were frustrating. They were very good at times and at others laughable. Snyder's over usage of slow motion sequences is also a major hurdle that hurts not only the pacing but the effectiveness of its usage...In short it is an ever so slight improvement over the original cut, but that is such a low bar it is barely watchable...", "Good plot, aspect ratio ruins it": "Why, why have black lines on the sides? It makes it completley uncinematic and makes it impossible for the viewer to be immersed. What a joke, no one cares about this bs vision of how film was in the 1920's, literally no one.

It is worth watching, though I had to split it into two nights as I started falling asleep during both airings, but to say it's the best comic book movie ever is ridiculous.\nI grew up working in the movie theater business so I pretty much enjoy movies from every genre from dramas to westerns to romcoms to horror movies and of course comedies and action movies so when I take my time to write a review for maybe that's not up to par, that means something, maybe not to others but since I don't usually do this I felt compelled.\nJust a few thoughts:\n1- The aspect ratio was a little offputting considering we all have flat panels these days but it wasn't terrible.\n2- The long drawn out slow motion scenes with The Flash were offputting, and not sure if it's true comic book self but he was too annoying and not likable. He is supposed to be faster than the speed of light but almost every scene with him was slow motion whereas they should've been fast to be more realistic, especially with so many of the other fight scenes in slow motion, it was too much.\n3- The fight scenes, especially the beginning with the terrorists and Wonder Woman were terrible, same thing for the fight scenes and WW84, not sure why DC technology is not up to par but looked like a bad B movie from the 80s or a bad video game and it took away from how bad ass she really is!\n4- Way too many over the top scenes trying to establish some of the background stories, especially the Aquaman introduction and the town folk singing when he went back into the water, it was like a Hallmark movie bad.\n5- With all Bruce's money and technology do you think he would've had a better device then some thing that has to crawl up a wall like a crab, nothing that can fly or hover or was that part of the later introduction of the ship that Cyborg needed to repair?\n6- And this one may be just me but why did Batman continue to use his fake deep voice so people wouldn't know he's Bruce Wayne when all of the JL team members already knew, just very odd!\n7- Another one that might just be me but if they are going to try to have an expanded DC universe and try to tie all these movies together with some continuity why do they have 10 versions of the Joker over the past couple years? Of course I'm exaggerating with 10 but still Jared Leto playing the Joker in separate movies looking completely different may be explained away but where does Joaquin Phoenix's version fit in or do we just forget about it and look at them all as separate movies with another different Batman coming soon too?Again not a terrible movie, it was watchable but not overly enjoyable and these reviews with nine or tens are way over the top and appear to be from diehard DC comic book fans rather than actual movie fans IMO!", "The best DC movie to date.": "Extremely happy that the Snyder cut was everything and more than anybody had ever hoped to see.

Cyborg was the most interesting character in the film for me. The introductions & development of the new heroes are essential, and they somehow just cut it all in the 2017 version.

They fill out the roles they should have had and not be sidekick characters as they were in the 2017 version.what is sad is now we see what the movie could have been really like , was it the best DC movie , maybe not , but was it a good Justice league movie ? YES it was.The movie had balance , great character development ... it was 4 hours but hell give me more 4 hour movies like this any day ... seriously .", "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. NOT AS UNITED!!!!": "I am not from the people who like to complain. I see all over the internet people saying that the colors were too dark, there was a lot slow motion in the movie or I got bored after the first 2 hours. OMG PEOPLE, JUST STOP COMPLAINING and make comparisons with other companies. Just ENJOY THIS MASTERPIECE and go watch Cinderella.Literally, the movie is a MASTERPIECE. We finally understood the plot. For me, it was not long, it was full of scenes with actions, Wonder Woman took what she truly deserves after the fiasco of WW84. Batman too. OMG I will for sure miss a solo movie of Ben Affleck with Jared Leto as Joker.Last but not least, even all the characters had a way better arc story than JL 2017, in my opinion the highlight of the movie is the FLASH scene and not Cyborg. O-M-G. I was literally crying. I saw this scene at least 5 times. The visuals, the feeling, the script for Flash's father and of course the music. It will always be imprinted into my brain, it was emotionally such a strong scene.Thank you Mr. Zack Snyder for this masterpiece. Unfortunately, WB does not like this version of JL but it has never fought us, NOT AS UNITED!", "Best of the best!": "This movie was how it should of been.

I was wondering how the movie was going to turn out, but Snyder has proven that my apprehension was misplaced. The movie is nothing short of an epic. It was a dream come true moment for a diehard Dc fan like me. I only felt Snyder could have made Steppenwolf a more menacing and sinister villain. Definitely the look of steppenwolf give creeps unlike the clownish steppenwolf of Whedon. Also the music at times was felt jarring. Those quibbles aside, looking at the larger picture Snyder's version is an exhilarating and coherent vision.Blending it with the lore.

Snyder cut definitely makes the cut.", "Phenomenal\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5": "Excellent work done by zack Snyder sir The best movie from snyder's direction the best superhero I have ever watched and the back ground score was extraordinary totally a master piece movie from DC .", "This is what the 2017 Justice League should have been": "The theatrical version of the film should be crushed and incased in cement and thrown in a landfill along side E.T. the video game (maybe that's a little extreme but you get the point) and this should be the only Justice League movie. This movie did so much for Cyborg , it made him one of the main characters instead of some side character, by telling his backstory and giving him a more important role in the movie and giving him more of a bond with Superman was awesome. Cyborg needs his own movie on. It also gave a little more backstory to the flash which I liked.I give this movie and 8.5 is because I want them to really play off this movie and give it some sequels I know there is more to the story and I hope Warner Bros dose too. I want to see a second part and maybe a third part to this movie where they fight Darkseid and is army. And they have Martin Manhunter join the fight and maybe Green lantern as well. There is so much left undone, we need the Snyderverse to be complete now and if that ever happens and those JL movies are as good as this one is, they might all get 10s or at least 9s because it would finish up the story and it would be amazing.Also this movie is a DC comics fanboys dream and I love it!", "DC needs to keep Snyder on!": "Nothing to say except Brilliant!

He also added several characters and scenes that are crucial for story telling and setting up the Snyder DC universe ahead. The 3 hours 50 minute runtime never felt too long. This project is a victory for the fans who fought for it! Thank you Snyder.p.s: try to watch it with another DC fan if you can.

Due to the hype I rented 'the snyder cut'. I wanted to give it a go. It was entertaining enough but lack of depth. The storyline also wasn't that great. Lots of moments that I thought 'why' or 'how'. Is Darkseid for example that stupid that he forgot the anti-life equation was on earth? And many other examples.Also the silly jokes and the exaggerated music just doesn't fit in in my opinion.Batman fot example isn't the batman from the 'batman vs superman movie'. He shifted character in this one. Anyway I'am a DC-fan but I don't think Warner Brothers will ever get the feeling right with justice league. Maybe I compare too much with the feeling I had with 'the nolan movies' or Joker. That is class cinema. For me this is just brainless entertainment with lack of story depth. I hope the stand alone batman movie with robert pattinson will regenerate that feeling again. I gave Justice League a try.

I had my doubts that this version would be any good, as in my opinion DC movies are almost always a let down. But this was different, pretty much an entirely different movie, and a much better one. Sadly, there probably won't be a continuation of this story arc.", "BRILLIANT. SNYDER'S VERSION IS SO MUCH BETTER": "I saw this film over 2 days with my family. We made the mistake of starting viewing after 9pm. Nearly pulled an all- nighter.\nBRILLIANT.\nThe four hours flew by. Every character in the JL was better served in this film, compared to Whedon's version.\nThe Amazons here are warriors. Their fight at the beginning is longer, bloodier, ferocious. They were the female equivalent of the Spartans in '300'.The contrast between Whedon's Amazons and Snyder's Amazons is ...startling. Many of the women playing Amazons are real life athletes (discus, javelin, shot put, boxing, weights crossfit champions) from the less glamorous sports. Snyder's version convinced viewers of their martial prowess. Whedon was more interested in them looking sexy. Reducing their battle was to the detriment of the film. Why did Whedon do it?\nWonder Woman was a total badass. The bank robbery scene is brutal. The display of her powers in this film is greater than in any other live action movie featuring her character. Her powerset is reduced in Whedon's film, her action sequences shorter, lower quality. Why?\nThe Flash is much more three dimensional, much more important in this film. The villain, Stephanwolf is way better, both visually and as regards character and dialogue. Ciaran Hinds was a caricature, with terrible CGI in the Whedon version. Affleck's Batman is a powerful, strategist and grim killer- not a feeble afterthought- in this film. His character was hobbled in Whedon's version. Why?The Justice League in this film has echoes of the brilliant animated series.The biggest revelation is Cyborg's character. He and Ray Fisher were done dirty in the 2017 film. Cyborg has a full character arc, his powers are immense in a digital age. The truncation of his story by Whedon made no cinematic sense.\nI had thought Fisher was exaggerating in his complaints. But every actor of colour in the Whedon version had their scenes shortened, or reduced, or were removed altogether. The quality of their dialogue diminished. I wasn't looking for that and it surprised me. Momoa, Fisher, Joe Morton, Ryan Zheng, Kiersey Clemmons and more all diminished. A waste of the great Joe Morton.\nWhy?\nNow, I believe Fisher. Warner Bros should give him a damn Cyborg film. He has the most developed character arc, he' s that good.\nI now understand why Momoa and other actors were calling for Snyder's version to be seen.\nIn fact the difference in the two versions of JL makes one thing clear: Zack Snyder is a filmmaker. Joss Whedon is not. He's a TV programme maker. His edits, cuts, new dialogue, etc were a lower quality than the original.\nWhedon destroyed this film. Me and my family were stunned at the massive difference in quality of the two versions. I was a big Joss Whedon fan.\nNow? Not so much.", "Hey WB have you learned your lesson yet?": "Stop interfering with the man's films and let him make the movies he wants to make. You were wrong about Dawn of Justice and you were wrong about Justice League. Its a beautiful thing to see his vision realized. What an amazing film. Satisfying in every way. Let's just hope the morons give him the bag so we can see the third part of the trilogy realized in a complete unmessed with sequel to this masterpiece. Give him the bag, step away and butt out. You are idiots. He knows what he is doing. Let him finish things off his way.", "Don't believe the hype.": "We waited how many years for a remake of this already \"let down\" of a movie.

This movie told a great and complete story, raised questions for the next story, added comicbook moments for all the geeks, and tied in all the other DCEU movies.

At first, I was skepticaI, I thought it was going to be the same movie but with some new shots, but I am so glad that zack's cut was released, it has nothing to do with the theatrical 2017 version, this is wayyy better, by far. In Whedon\u00b4s version they are so many plot holes, it\u00b4s hard to watch and hard to understand, but in Snyder\u00b4s version, everything makes sense, This is the movie that as a Justice League fan I've been waiting for so long, since I was a child, it\u00b4s a dream come true. This is definitely a must see, I highly recommend it. Go watch it and let's all support this movie so we can have the second part! Hats off to Zack Snyder because finally someone did justice to this iconic superheroes.\nThis movie its well done in so many ways and I didn\u00b4t even mind about the 4 hours.", "Upsetting that this will be the pinnacle of DCEU": "The DCEU for me as a film and comic book fan has been a rocky road. I actually really liked man of steel, suicide squad was forgettable, and i felt batman v superman was rushed. It was missing a standalone batman film that ended with the man of steel climax. As a batman fan i needed to see the events that made him this murdering maniac. Not just a glimpae of robins suit. But all in all BvS wasnt the worse film especially the extended cut. And then came justice league.\nI understand studio interference is what lead to justice league parts 1 and 2 being crammed into just one film, and i never held out much hope after hearing this back when filming had begun, it seemed warners were not going to take their time to deveolp this world and its characters like it really needed and instead were gonna go all in, max warp. I dont think i need to go into it all but we all know what ended up in cinemas was awful. I never thought we would see the film Zack had managed to film as best he could under the circumstances. Im so glad we did, its easily my favourite DCEU film. and i want to thank everyone that campaigned to get it out. It is easily the pinnacle of the DCEU, and unless they move forward with sequels to this, it always, sadley will be.", "Much better!": "Really wish this version would have been released. Granted it's 4hrs long (so probably 2 movies), but it's a much better movie, gives background information about almost every plot hole left in the theater cut, and it just flows better. Plus the DC universe probably wouldn't be the mess it currently is in. Which is a shame, I would have liked to see more Batfleck. I guess we'll just have to see if this helps them right the ship or not. Now it's just waiting for Ezra's Flash movie.", "The Movie DC Universe Deserved (No Spoilers)": "I honestly don't know what Warner Bros were thinking when they released the original Justice League or what happened for them to approve the new version. The fact that Zack Snyder himself didn't even watch the theatrical release of the movie; everything is just bizarre.Luckily for us, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a thing now and it's great. It improves on the story in every way possible, adds new scenes, new lore, new characters, it's honestly a different movie. If people were disappointed about the original, I hope they can give the new release a second chance and maybe with the great reception it had, there's a chance for sequels now.

BUT EFF me that nightmare sequence and ending leaves you wanting so much moooooooreeeee!", "Zac Snyder actually managed to make me like Ben Affleck as Batman": "Not only has Zac Snyder done the impossible, which is to make me believe that Ben Affleck is Batman... but he has also given each character their due time, backstory that is well explained and no crazy jumps and holes... I waited in hope for 4 years for this and it was worth every second. It's like watching a comic book come to life and morph into this epic, beautiful and well paced movie with cool camera pans, slow-mo moves and classic fight scenes. My kids noticed that this one had a bit more bloodshed but it wasn't overpowering. Soooo impressed, we haven't had a good super hero movie that's not going overboard with slapstick humour and bad writing in a really long time!!

He wants to create a continuity...this is the only thing that DCEU doesn't have. So we need batfleck movie and more movies from him...the snyder cut is Amazing we need him to make more movies on DC superheroes.", "\"I'm Not Broken, and I'm Not Alone\"": "9.4/10The film nobody ever expected to be released has finally arrived, and it stands tall in its hall of justice amongst some of the greatest superhero films of all time. Zack Snyder's Justice League (not to be confused with that trashy mess that was 2017s Justice League, in which 5% of it was directed by Zack Snyder and the rest by Joss Whedon in a desperate attempt by Warner Bros to make a \"Marvel\" film) is everything we could have ever hoped for in the 4hr, glorious R rated epic. Following the immediate tragic events of Batman v Superman, Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince team up to unite a group of defenders against an ancient evil that threatens the existence of the entire universe.\"I'm not broken. And I'm not alone.\" - CyborgThere's not much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. Zack Snyder continues his epic saga of slow motion and visual storytelling, two crafts he's perfected at this point, to tell what may possibly be the final act in his \"Snyderverse\". Off the gate, it's a masterfully directed and shot film, with Emmy nominated Fabian Wagner (Game of Thrones, Sherlock, Overlord) behind the camera. There isn't a single shot in this film that doesn't go to waste, or that can't be screen grabbed, printed, and hung on your wall in a frame. Looking at Zack Snyder's previous work, you expect nothing less than gorgeous when it comes to cinematography, yet Snyder continues to impress by constantly raising his own bar, and it truly shows here. From the shot composition, to the best CGI a $70mil budget can buy, to the overall sound design, to the incredible action set pieces, this film from a technical standpoint is a damn near masterpiece.Let's talk changes! One of the biggest things I was most hyped for was, as always, the score. After Snyder left the project back in 2017, one of the crimes Whedon committed in his takeover was firing the films composer, Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL, and replaced him with veteran composer Danny Elfman. I'm not saying the 2017 score wasn't good, it was definitely enjoyable, but it was far more lighthearted, and relied on nostalgia as a cheap seduction method by reusing bits and pieces of his score from the 1989 Batman with Michael Keaton. The score lacked an emotional range, which ultimately took away from the weight of some of the films more major scenes. All of that has been remedied in this version, as it is SOOOOO MUCH better. Completely recomposed with brand new material, but maintaining continuity in themes from Man of Steel and BvS, it gives this film a new emotional pedestal to stand high on, something severely lacking 4 years ago.\"How do you know your team's strong enough? If you can't bring down the charging bull, then don't wave the red cape at it.\" - Alfred PennyworthThe acting, as expected, is beyond superb. We all knew this going in. Affleck is the perfect Bruce Wayne, and the perfect Batman, Gal Gadot has made her presence in the modern superhero genre extremely clear, from her introduction in BvS, to having two standalone films. Jason Momoa was great, he was given FAR more character than in his previous excerpt, where Whedon essentially made him a badass meathead. This character has intellect, strategy, morals that were never truly realized. Ezra Miller was such a huge improvement. I never liked his character of Flash, I always kind of found him useless and unnecessary, and solely there as the comic relief. While he is still quite funny in this version, he is also given more depth, FAR more to do, especially in the climactic third act, and he's able to really flex his acting chops as the character is given so much more backstory and motivation. Jeremy Irons as Alfred is, obviously, perfect. He doesn't try to be past Alfreds, or replace them, he simply stands on his own, and works wonders with the rest of the cast. For the most part, the chemistry between the actors is effortless, especially working under a director they respect. Henry Cavill has some of my all time favourite Superman moments to ever bless the screen in this film. He is Superman. He is Clark Kent. Warner Bros may replace him in the end, but this is our generations Superman, and nothing for us will top this, not for a long, long time.Let's talk Cyborg, since that's what most people are going to bring up as the biggest change in this cut. Back in 2017, his contribution to the film was \"Booyah\". He was barely a character, and ranked amongst some of the weakest side characters in regards to superhero films within the last 10 years. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY RAY FISHER WAS PISSED. They cut his entire story arc, as he was the heart and soul of this film. His struggling relationship with his father, Silas Stone (Joe Morton), his tragic life, his God complex, his character motivation, every single thing that makes him a fan favourite in the comics has been realized here, where he is an intriguing character, and has risen from one of the worst side characters, to one of the greatest \"heroes born through tragedy\".\"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph.\" - Roger EbertThe villains in this film. Are. AWESOME. OH MY GOD. Steppenwolf is AMAZING. Darkseid is AMAZING. THE VILLAINS ARE AMAZING!! Snyder gave them depth, he gave them a purpose. He gave Steppenwolf a justifiable purpose for his existence, a reason for him to commit these brutal acts of violence, they gave him a drive. They turned from a cardboard cutout, an excuse for an action scene, into a real, deeper character that we don't necessarily sympathize with, but grow to understand.\"You Can Be Anything You Want to Be\" - Wonder WomanOne thing this film is going to face a lot of criticism with is its overwhelming 4 hour runtime. While that may be a turn off for a lot of people, I wasn't at all bothered by it. I religiously watch the Extended Cuts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy at least once a year, so I'm already somewhat desensitized to longer runtimes, but this films pacing was absolutely masterful. The 4 hours blew by insanely fast, and it felt closer to a 3 hour film than anything. One of the best things about this being on a streaming platform such as HBO Max (or in our case Crave) is the fact that Snyder broke the film up into 6 individual chapters and an epilogue. This makes room for snack breaks, washroom breaks, and, if needed, a brief pause and time to revisit (I'd recommend pausing around Chapter 5, as it marks the halfway point). Many people are able to get lost in series binging, and go through an average of 3-5 hours in a sitting, so in reality this is 100% doable, as long as you are able to pace yourself. Even limiting to two chapters and doing it in three sessions works out, and gives you time to absorb it.While this is an absolutely phenomenal film, and one of the greatest director's cuts we've ever been gifted, it isn't without its flaws. This is NOT a perfect film. There's still a few corny lines, and some scenes that could be cut, although I understand why they didn't do the latter. It's got a bit of a Return of the King ending in which it has a few wrap up points, and tends to just keep ending and ending, even setting up Affleck's standalone Batman film and potential for a sequel or two. Again, I understand why they did it, this may be Snyder's last DC film and he wanted to put everything he's got into it, but it was a little overblown (though still enjoyable). All that being said, I think my biggest flaw with the film is the development of Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Unfortunately, she's the only character that doesn't have much to do throughout this 4 hour epic. While she does have her own arc (and a powerful one in regards to themes of tragedy, grief, and depression, an arc that I'm sure was done intentionally, mirroring what Zack and his wife Deborah Snyder had to go through while making this film), and they take it and develop it, it's unfortunately the only thing she really does in this film. They allude to her having a much more major part to play in what would've been future films, done through premonitions and dream sequences, but we are never shown. Instead of cutting some unnecessary content out and putting more time towards her character, unfortunately she is fairly sidelined.\n\"For Autumn\" - Zack SnyderZack Snyder's Justice League should never have happened the way it did. We should have gotten this 4 years ago, but we didn't. This film could've been shelved, and maybe we could've had a Superman II: Donner Cut situation where it came out in 20 years, but thanks to the dedication of the fans, and HBO Max being great, we didn't. This film had everything riding against it, and we got the best possible version we could have. Comic book fans will probably enjoy this film, Snyder fans will most likely love this film. If you're not a Snyder fan, I doubt this is going to be the film to push you over the edge, as it has his style down to the core. This film, as it's been with every DC film since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy won't be for everyone, and I'm sure will be decisive, especially in today's day and age, but goddamn if this isn't some of the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time. As Junkie XL's epic piece \"The Crew at Warpoint\", and we get a truly touching, emotional tribute to Autumn Snyder, who tragically passed away during production, and you sit steamy eyed through the credits, blown away by what you dedicated your evening to, we know who this film was truly for. She would be proud. We all are. That being said, who am I to say how you'll feel, I'm just a fan with a laptop. Sit down, watch it, and decide for yourself where you stand.\"Faith, Alfred. Faith.\" - Bruce Wayne", "This is not a drill! A classic incoming!!": "Zack Snyder triumphs with this characters. The action and the story beats are insane! The editing and the music are top notch. This film flows like a river. Whoever says Snyder doesn't understand this characters needs to reconsider their position. Zack Snyder's Justice League delivers and more. The aspect ratio makes the heroes seem epic and larger than life. Can't wait to watch it again and hopefully get an IMAX screening because this movie needs to be seen in the biggest screen possible. Jackson, Nolan Cameron and Scorsese should be very proud.", "AWFUL writing but decent action and character backstories.": "So to start off with; I haven't watched the other version because... It's just rated as an awful movie? Anyway - Snyder cut probably made it a lot better, hence the 6.\nThis is more of a 6.5/10 than a 6, but for me it doesn't break the 7 barrier according to my own rating system. A 7 in my book needs at least somewhat decent writing and an actual logical/believable construction that doesn't bring in more questions than it answers.So, let's start out: The writing is horrendous. Straight up hideous and truly matches comic-book quality.\nA bad guy who conquers universes for a living drives his armada of spaceships (2-3 ships) to Earth in search of ???Anti-life formula??? (Gotta get back to you on that one) - With him, he has 3 horadric cubes (MacGuffin) and some wizard dudes to control them. The cubes when combined somehow blow the planet up and make all the survivors bend to bad guy's will, turning them into evil metal insect puppets. (????)\nHe, the \"conqueror\" of universes and \"destroyer\" (Those 2 don't rly match, do they?) of 100000 worlds steps onto planets by himself, roars and has roughly 500 insect puppets and a few wizardrers with him as his grand army. All he has to do is simply step onto a world, combine the 3 cubes and boom, magic conquest! He ends up failing to conquer Earth and gets heavily wounded in the process due to ancient heroes stopping him, thus retreating back to his infernoworld.\nSomehow he lost the GPS coordinates to Earth, and spent 5000 years randomly conquering new worlds to make up for it - IN A DIFFERENT WAY! Now he sends his \"Unexplained backstory slave villain\" to do precisely the same thing as he did. This bad guy somehow conquered 50000 worlds with the help of the 3 cubes (WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THE 3 CUBES??? Gotta get back to you on that one.) Eventually this bad guy comes to Earth and thus the movie goes like - Villain arrives, evil plan, evil master, collect the MacGuffin, heroes meet villain, fight, come up with a counterplan, raid villain fortress, etc.\nThe mega bad guy also hears of Earth being the long-lost GPS coordinate planet that holds the only thing that matters in the multiverse for him (strangely) and thus decides to act like a proper scripted villain and declare \"I will come there when you win! Even though I've been searching for 5000 years, I'm going to wait here until you win! My advisor told me you will lose, but I won't help you regardless!\"Yeah, that's about it for the absolute failure of a story this is. There's more competent novels written by first-timing hobby authors with English as a 2nd language that are barely 100 pages long.Other failures? Why would a super high-tech research facility about alien stuff have a janitor with a disgusting looking mop? Seriously?\nThe bug dudes look ridiculous. If you're using CGI this heavily, at least try to make actual insects rather than \"dudes with insect wings\".\nAbilities do WAY different damage depending on the situation. They fell buildings like they're houses of cards but Batman's aluminum bracers are literally godlike tools that resist 5 full seconds of laser eyes and all manner of weapons.\nDid those huge plasma cannons randomly grow out of the ground towards the end? Also why are modern human weapons capable of razing entire buildings and the \"fortress walls\" when huge super-high tech alien plasma cannons barely take down single enemies?That's enough of the negativity, or this wouldn't be a 6.5 in my book.\nWhat's good? The heroes have backstories and are respected somewhat. They have no reason to work together so the story makes a scenario where they all will regardless as an introduction to eachother. Half of the CGI is quite decent, and there's a LOT of CGI, which makes it pretty impressive considering it's a 4 hour movie made up of 60-70% CGI.\nThey tried in some scenes to portray how powerful impacts were, although most of the times physics turn into pure magic, some times they actually tried to show them - successfully.\nThe action scenes are both snappy as well as slow and zooming, alternating between the 2 regularly shows both brutal impacts as well as zooming around the battlefield with close-ups of important attacks. This works to some effect, but can also feel a bit draggy at times.Effects of the Snyder cut - It's LONG, something I love to see. In this case, it has a ton of benefits, probably huge story improvements over the OG and also brings some side-effects.\nThe benefits are obvious even if I haven't watched the OG. A LOT of screentime is slowed down dialogue and character justifications, building quite solid backstories to our \"lesser known\" heroes, as well as setting up a satisfying \"I did it!\" situation when they finally win.\nThe drawbacks are also there - You can REALLY tell when some scenes weren't in the OG movie as both the timing of the scene and the pace between 2 scenes abruptly change. This makes it feel like a stitchwork at times, although it only happens twice or thrice throughout the movie.", "Tedious": "Four hours of Very tedious film. I not recomend t\u00f4 anyone.", "filled w/ idle moments": "How to expand a 2.5-hr movie to 4 hrs? Just fill with background moments that everyone already know about, emotional moments that feel no emotion, and prolonged dialogs that make no impact.\nThe original 2017 movie has superb flow of storyline and great humor. This one tells the same story, but with tons of yawn-inducing moments. It's like Thor in a fat suit.", "2 problems but willing to ignore it": "The only problems for me with this movie were the ratio, and the WW arabic music, I would've preferred the original bad ass WW music because it's better, but I'm willing to ignore both of them and still give it a 10 because WB did Superman, Batman, WW, Flash, Cyborg, Steppenwolf and Darkseid dirty and thanks to Snyder, he gave them all justice.", "Absolutely sublime": "An absolute treat from start to finish. It couldn't be more different in tone and style than the sub-par offering from whedon. Each character is treated with dignity and there is enough time to flesh out their characters. Barry is still funny in this movie but it is shown as just one facet of his personality rather than him being in the movie purely for comic relief. Victor is restored as the emotional clout and his family dynamic and character arc is hugely satisfying. Almost all of the plot holes in the previous rendition are answered and scenes which once seemed out of place now serve to enrich a more coherent plot. The only gripe I have is that Superman was still a little under utilised and it would have been nice to explicitly explain the use of the black suit to recharge his solar energy rather than it seeming that he just fancied going emo. The one thing that I'm sure everyone will agree on having watched this new version is that the casting of all lead parts is inspired and there can be no question that the Snyder verse will continue with one if not multiple sequels. Leto's conversation with Affleck's Batman already trumps all previous live-action interactions between the two famous foes and who wouldn't want to watch Manganiello's Slade Wilson hunting the Batman?", "What it should have been 3+ years ago.": "As my headline states. A real shame as so much more could have come of it.", "Snyder": "This movie is the best I have ever seen in my life. Great story. Great character development. Great villian. And everything you need for a superhero movie.", "Doesn't erase all the wrongdoings - Yet unique, epic and powerful": "The expectations were high, yet Snyder doesn't disappoint with a strong and visually stunning movie that definitely feels much more like a complete piece of art than was the butchered Whedon cut. Cyborg gets his right due, Flash gets fleshed out better, and the aesthetics, while it won't satisfy those who aren't sympathetic towards Snyder's style, makes it feel like a complete and satisfying movie, with the long 4 hours being legitimate.It doesn't makes some action scenes quite lackluster and still being a simple get-the-macguffin-boxes story, it isn't the masterpiece some were hoping for, and it's fine. It didn't have to be. It has style, gravitas, class, and epicness that is elevated by the Imax choice of image.\nIn a post Avengers world with no visual artistry, Zack Snyder's Justice League stands out as a good starting point to make superhero movies feeling finally huge in scope. Here's hoping to a Gladiator-epic masterpiece when the time is right.", "It's everything I hoped it to be": "The movie is 4 hours and it really needed to be this long to tell us the whole story and to make us feel with characters. Not at any moment does it feel dull and not at any moment throughout the movie I thought this moment isn't necessary in here.", "From the best movie in the comic books": "Cyborg is veteran good\ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb An i like the superman black suits", "Far better than theatrical release": "...but still nothing to write home about. It beats all of the Marvel movies I ever watched, but that doesn't say much since I'm not a fan of superhero genre in a first place. Most of the time I find these flicks being far too infantile and I absolutely despise identity politics they force on everyone. This one is not sparred of aforementioned pc moments, but it's bearable.\nWith that out of the way, let's dig into the story... Which is on the surface pretty much the same as in the theatrical cut, but with significantly more build up, (and therefore) character development and a lot less plot holes. Villain is more menacing, Gal Gadot's acting is passable this time around (though the horrible \"Kal-El, no!\" line is still in), all of the characters are essential to the story and, like I said, the plot is pretty much coherent.\nCyborg and the Flash got plenty of screen time and depth to them.\nBatman is, once again, the badass as we all know & love from BvS. Though still guilt ridden, he is nowhere near the wimp that was Joss Whedon's take on the character.\nBut... the baddest of the badass award goes to - Superman, hands down! After the (fully explained and dramatic) resurrection, the fight between him and the rest of the league goes pretty much the same as it did in theatrical release only this time, due to the extra footage, he puts even more hurt on them and genuinely attempts to outright murder the Flash and Batman. And this time around, the Dark Knight has no backup plan up his sleeve. Dumb lines such as \"do you bleed\" are gone. Superman is silent, deadly and unstoppable. His presence far more intimidating than the Steppenwolf's.\nTalking about the latter, the epilogue of the battle between him and the Man of Steel in the movie finale remains the same as in the 2017 version. The difference is that this time, Supes beats him to a pulp. All of the reviewers seem to refer to Wonder Woman cutting Steppenwolf's head while the fact is that she and the Aquaman just brutally finished off a helpless opponent, courtesy of Superman going apeshit on the guy.\nWith all this said, the criticism is pointed towards the length of the movie. Pacing is super-slow during the first few chapters and somewhat inconsistent throughout. Too many slow motion scenes and a several needless ones that would probably be better off left on a cutting room floor. The ending with the Martian Manhunter showing up in Batmans lake house sucked hard. As well as the inclusion of the scene where MM takes the shape of Martha Kent and goes to comfort grieving Lois. The scene would work a lot better if it were just Martha and Lois talking. The Knightmare sequences are pointless since there obviously won't be a sequel, but, since this film is a fan service, there it is, for the sake of why not. Also, it is unclear why in the end Darkseid didn't just step through the portal to take on the League. Apart from the fact that the sequel would need to happen and current movie finally come to a closure.\nOverall, we got a decent film. Dark and gritty, but more mature than the Disney-like watered down approach to the genre which I came to loath over the years. The lesson in how superheroes should be transitioned to the big screen and probably one of the last genuine superhero films of the era.", "Amazing and how DC should be": "Amazing job by Zack Snyder, he definitely understands DC and puts his heart and soul into this project. The fact that Joss Whedon replaced the good scenes with the silly ones makes me think he should not direct again.This makes me love dark movies even more, I like how every serious scene isn't cut by a joke unlike how Marvel does it. Hope the general audience would be more into DC soon, can't wait for more.", "Order has been restored. AMAZING! PHENOMENAL": "Honestly, this movie gave me chills. It had my heart pounding it had me on the edge of my seat and at more than one occasion my mouth physically dropped. Instantly my favourite movie of all time. The Josstice league mistake never happened in my opinion. It was nothing more than a bad gag joke. Joss Whedon either has no clue what he is doing or how to do his job or he purposefully sabotaged what would have been a game changing movie. That is my honest opinion. This movie is absolutely phenomenal!", "Slo motion added at least two hours": "This film is terrible and far too drawn out. I was amazed that even with the extension of time,(4 hours?? Seriously?!?) Wonder Woman and Aquaman remain underdeveloped. 2 hours in and the film establishes what should have been within the first 20-30 minutes of run time. Also gratuitous amounts of Cyborg? Why? Isn't he a side character? I doubt anyone was clamoring for more Cyborg over the rest of the heroes. Those who love Snyder's work will probably like this, or those who were fans of the original release. I subjected myself to both original and this honestly, I didn't give it a one because it was slightly (key emphasis on slightly) better than the first cut.", "When too much is too much": "I can be short,unlike the movie: sometimes less can be more. Way overdone!", "Zack Snyder'a Masterclass": "Wow Zack Snyder leaves no stone unturned and makes you wanting more from a 4 hour movie. I never felt like the pace of the movie was lacking. Looking forward to Warner brothers giving us the Snyderverse we deserve. Money talks and I hope they allow him to carry out his beautiful vision of the DC Universe.", "Like a Flashpoint episode": "I feel like I've just seen an alternate reality version of Justice League which would have been enthusiastically followed by Ben Affleck's Batman, Flashpoint Flash, and the expanded Justice League movie.\nMakes me ponder the difference between James Bond and Austin Powers.", "Gongrats!!!": "Hello from Bulgaria! This movie is coolest from DC. Zack Snyder is have a vision for how it works storylines. Big PRO! 2017 JL ... Was nothing with this story from snyder. We deserve that,he deserve that.

It really just goes to show that one singular vision should never be messed with. Joss Whedon (it turns out) is a horrible, sewer person who got lucky with the Avengers after he was given amazing material. I loved just about everything about this version of the film. Aside from a few inconsistencies, it was spot on. Definitely going to rewatch!!!", "How it should be done": "Zack is a genius! This should have been the 1st and only release.. Descriptive back story to really see the personality of each character.. and the back story that develops through this movie is perfect. Great job Zack! Thank you!", "Finally a movie that shows how good DC is!": "All heroes have something to do in the movie and at least it show how powerful they are, it's not just about superman will do everything as always!", "Phenomenally Enjoyed It": "You can clearly see through this that Joss was brought in to hack this movie to pieces. Execs were wrong on this one.It was carefully paced and the interactions felt more natural in this.It's an epic introduction to something more. Something darker. Or someone...", "This is DC........Not Marvel People": "The Snyder cut is not something everyone is going to love or understand.\nThe verison we received in 2017 was nothing compared to this one. Thank you Zach - Autumn would be proud.", "What I expected": "It is what I expected for Snyder tbh. Cool scenes and not much else. Most of the movie is filler. I'm sure they could have removed a few slow motion scenes to make it shorter or removed Aquaman littering the ocean or The flash saving someone and then proceeding to be creepy about it.", "What League should have looked like": "This is what I actually expected to see when I first found out about the movie Justice League! I know that this is not MCU, but it really doesn't have to be something similar! And the Zack Snyder's Justice League finally showed what an amazing and deep Universe DCEU is. The whole 4 hours kept me hyped and wanting to know what's next. I do remember the 2017 Justice League, but it seemed to me like two EXTREMELY DIFFERENT movies. I watched it as if I've never seen the 2017 JL before. And it's great! I finally understood lots of plots that were put into the story, I finally saw my favorite characters at their best. And I've finally got this satisfying feeling that JL got on the same level as Avengers. Anyhow, so many characters and surprising moments, so many plots and explanations...and so many epic scenes that it really made me wish for more! Amazing work, Zack! I wish we had this movie instead of the original one back in 2017. And Thank You!", "A masterpiece that was nearly lost to the world": "As the ultimate test, I convinced my wife (who is far from obsessed with superhero films) to watch the Snyder cut, as she had sat through the 2017 Whedon disaster &, at the time, commented that it made little sense & was a let down. She & I were blown away at Snyder's Justice League. It's virtually another film. Yes it's long, but you wouldn't change it. The story makes sense, it has emotional depth, great effects, & when the team click you'll be cheering at your TV. Steppenwolf has gone from cringe fest to menacing villain. Thank you Zak.", "Worth the fight": "Definitely the best DC movie period. The snyder vision really come to live. Worth the wait worth the fight.", "Synderverse Revival Required": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a brilliant movie with great fight sequences and far superior storytelling, which just proves why Zack Snyder is such a brilliant director. The Villian has a much better motive and is far more menacing that the Theatrical version. Better backstories connects the overall story.", "Emotional and amazing": "I literally teared up in some scenes, it was an amazing ride and I didn't want the movie to end. Would love for it to get some sequels.", "Good , but too long": "This was a great movie . I do think its much better than the version we got to see a few years ago . But come on ..... 4 hours . Thats too long for a movie . I had to watch it in 2 sessions .", "A TOTAL DIFFERENT BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE": "Only if this was the one to be released in 2017, Dc would have been at a total different stage right now. Worth the petitions, worth the fight and worth the patience for over 3 years to get this masterpiece to the cinematic world. All I can say is, Someone throw a bucket of water on WB and make them realise the worth of Zack Snyder and the magic he can create by carrying this forward.", "Restore the Snyder verse.": "What can I say really, You know how it feels when we watch Awesome movie the inspirational vibe this gives is totally bonkers and I know there's more to come, Zack Snyder is a man with A vision. If you love getting inspired, this is it. Stop looking for reviews coz they can be paid to create negative influence.\nJust watch it.", "Old Wine in New Bottle \ud83c\udf7e": "Just unbelievable.\nHow a same movie portrayed in two different way, it never feels like i have watched this movie before.\nZack synder is complete genius, this movie should be the part of DCEU.\nOverall Amazing movie, 4 hours never looked like 4 hrs.\nWorth the hype, petitions, fans' struggle and wait for synder cut.", "Everything is ardently exquisite! BUT the aspect ratio is trash.": "A huge discrepancy between Whedon's version and SnyderCut, hence Snyder's version is excell to merit our satisfaction from its recent version. I cannot pull it all out and exudes my explanation; movie is so nice! The new background music is also resplendent but the aspect ratio will always put myself in a carcass goat and that is the sole problem of the movie. Ergo, one of the best film right now. Snyder's version as its best, We want the SEQUEL.", "Highly entertaining. Enjoyed every moment.": "Thanks ZS. I'm so glad you were able to bring us your memorable vision of what the movie could have been. Really hope you get to work on more JL.", "For a film that has been recycled, Snyder does it well": "When we talk about Snyder Cut, we are talking about the vision of Zack Snyder, from that, I can only judge this film with parts in the changes that have occurred. The whole film is a good film, but the parts that were changed by snyder, are really brilliant. The ending is much more impactful, the dialogues are better, but still need to be more natural.", "3 star because Amber Heard was added in this movie": "Why Zack why?She is most bad person I have seen my life who can lie under oath and destroy innocent person's life.The way she is saying lies after lies in court and Johnny has to listen to that. What kind of world we are living in where Amber Heard kind of lady just blabbering about lies and just lies.", "Better than the 2017 version, but still I find it hard to truly love this movie.": "I honestly was not really hyped up to see this movie coz i was greatly discouraged by Whedon's version. Fortunately, this movie made certain amount of surprises with more background story to characters such as Cyborg and Flash and a whole lot of additional never before seen scenes given its 4-hour run time. The action scenes are ok, still the generic DC movie fight scenes which are dark and bloody.However, I still find it hard to truly love and admire coz of some aspects like how some scenes are just comparable to watching a video game. Another annoying part for me is when i saw Lex Luthor and Joker who are just acted by the wrong choice of actors. I applaud Zack Snyder for his dedication in creating and developing DCEU through his movies but for me, superhero movies should be relatable to all types of audiences kids and oldies alike.", "Best of the best 10": "I had watched this movie for 2 days because it's too long, but i didn't regret it, it's so awesome, all stories, all characters, and plot hole, gasp, is so good, if you watch this movie, i guarantee, you will ask ben afleck and henry cavill to comeback as batman and superman i the future film.", "Ladies and gentlemen...ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE!": "Along with Avengers Endgame, Zack Snyder's Justice League is my favorite movie and one of the best superhero movie. For someone like me who loved MOS and BVS,I found this movie epic from the beginning!The soundtrack by Junkie Xl is amazing and this film has the most beautiful soundtrack of all superhero movies! I must add that I had more chills in this movie than on Endgame!I immediately start by saying that as the film is structured is simply perfect and the photography of each scene is breathtaking. Guys, the CGI is fantastic and amazing! I loved Darkseid and I really want to see him again with Ray Porter's voice. I especially loved Steppenwolf and I have no comments to describe it is a fantastic villain. In this movie I saw the best Wonder Woman, Cyborg is the best character and Flash is the most amazing character and this movie makes you love Aquaman.But my favorite character of all is Ben Affleck's Batman, his scenes are all epic and fantastic , the best Batman for me! Not to mention the last 10 minutes of chills! The final left me speechless and I witnessed the redemption of the Joker of Leto!What can I say guys, I loved this movie and 4 hours flew and I want to see more. The best DC movie !", "EPIC!!": "This is what should have been released from the start. Movie is cohesive and masterfully done. The attention to detail and character development is spot on.

The characters of Cyborg, Flash, and even Aquaman were fresh and extremely moving. I fell in love with these characters from the very beginning. The grittiness and danger of evil lurking was a testimonial to the difference of the DC comics and Marvel Comics. Steppenwolf was a real creature with dark ambitions and a scary new dominating look. Batman and wonder woman are the duo! Never skipping a beat to making this whole movie more enjoyable with their character arcs and badass mentality's!The whole take on Superman's solidarity being very prevalent in Man Of Steel to Batman V Superman makes his own character arc even better. He's a hero who knows he's a protector and knows what he must do to save this world. The premonitions and knight mares of what will come if Darkseid uses The Anti Life Equation is scary in itself and I love it. The fact that we see Superman evil in ways I only saw on paper in the comics is awesome. This is a dark and gritty Superman and when he arrives he steals the show. The idea to bring a God back to a world where Clark feels alone is a very good plot in this story. Superman's connection to Earth is his own mother and father and Lois. Take all of them out of the equation and he is a alone and upset Superman. That is when Darkseid will use the anti life equation to recruit Superman to destroy the world. This idea is seen throughout the whole movie with the risk of bringing the God back to life. This is why the Snyderverse must come back we must see this story fulfilled with all these characters! We must see the sacrifice the premonitions show of Wonder woman's and Aquaman's death! #bringbackthesnyderverae", "Finally Snyder did it!!": "I wish now I hadn't seen the whedon version.This movie does it all.

Snyder's style, while not everyone's cup of tea, will surprise those looking for a different approach to superhero films that offer a light and less gloomy outlook. The cinematography, as a usual feature of this director, leads us to paintings and varied astonishing visual references; the soundtrack is very powerful, and the visual effects are quite well accomplished.

(Even though at 1 or 2 scene its not well done but that's okay it may be due to the budget given by WB to Zack) This is the Justice League that fans and real comic book hardcore DC Fans would love in addition with its ambition scope and artistic integrity. This is one of the greatest superhero movie of all time. It's a must watch for every DC Fans or even normal superhero movies fans too!!!Would be more good if we get continuation for this movie.", "Totally Redeemed yourself": "By far best DCU entry! Zack Snyder \"this is my true vision for Justice League\" ....Also Zack Snyder \"I want my vision to be seen on a TV from 1996\"", "Just amazing \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d": "I have seen completely other movie than original! Hats off to zack Snyder. Every superhero movie fan should watch this. A perfect masterpiece!!", "\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d": "Th best thing from dc & zack thanks alot\nBatman soooo dark\nSuperman sut is very lovely\nCyborg i love him\nFlash is very fast & help full\nWonder women sheis so hoooot\nMarten i waiting for some hting\nJoker monky", "\"Best DC Movie, Best Superhero Movie \"": "\"The best DC movie its totally a new movie with more and more interesting aspects you will never get bored for a minute the future is DC universe in superhero best VFX ever an all round entertainment you will forget the world for 4hrs Loved it\"", "What I Hope Is The Rebirth Of The Snyder-Verse.": "I entered this film trying to treat it just like any other film, not as a 'fanboy' of the DC Universe and Zack Snyder's Vision of what that should be. My rating for Zack Snyder's Justice League is 8/10, which if you exclude Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, puts this film at the top of my Superhero Movie List along with another Snyder great, Watchmen. So, is this film better than the original Justice League that came out in 2017? I'll give you the short answer straight away - yes, it's a lot better. I feel like the best way to write a review for this film is to highlight the drastic improvements Snyder has made to his cut compared to the 2017 original:Steppenwolf - In the original, Steppenwolf is a brainless villain who wants to kill everything that crosses his path and destroy every planet in the universe. His only purpose in that film was to be the generic 'bad guy' and 'punching bag' for the Justice League. In Snyder's cut, Steppenwolf has some more depth and character. He isn't just this big CGI monster anymore, he has a purpose and objective. We learn more backstory about how he is in debt to Darkseid for trying to betray him, and owes him 50,000 conquered planets before he can return home. I also think that Snyder's new Steppenwolf look was much better. I don't think it was perfect and at times it looked a little dodgy, but overall he looks much more fierce and threatening to the heroes.Character Development - I was very impressed by the character development in this film. Crucial scenes were left out of the 2017 original which are thankfully included in Snyder's cut. The character who benefited from these added scenes the most was of course Cyborg. We learn his entire origin story through flashbacks - the car crash which took his mother's life and ultimately turned him into Cyborg. There are also invaluable scenes which show him trying to learn his powers and accept what he has become. However, for me the best added scenes with Cyborg are those that shed more light on his fragile relationship with his father. We never really had any idea as to why their relationship was so tense before this film, but Snyder has now given us much more explanation and it's great. Cyborg is now a character with emotion and someone the fans can get behind and support. I should also mention that The Flash is a much better character in the Snyder cut as well. In the 2017 original, The Flash is almost a useless character in the final battle, as all he does is push a pickup truck with a family inside to safety. Snyder gives him a crucial role in the final battle, as he reverses time when the Mother Boxes fuse and technically destroy the world.Maturity - The original Justice League was a family friendly, light-hearted 'joke', with a terrible colour pallet and tone throughout the entire movie. A perfect example of this is the red hue in the sky during the final battle. In my opinion, it looks terrible and just doesn't fit well with the film. Snyder's cut is dark and serious - the stupid jokes like \"I heard you can talk to fish\" are gone - this is a 4 hour film, there's no time to waste! The awful scene in the original where Aquaman is sat on the Lasso Of Truth and wastes valuable minutes of film time talking rubbish is gone. These awful scenes have been replaced with scenes that hold meaning and actually drive the story forward.A 4 hour film might seem daunting, but to me it felt a lot shorter. It's thoroughly entertaining and engaging the entire way through. This isn't a perfect movie, but as far as Superhero films go this is excellent and achieves a monumental level of epic-ness on par with Avengers Endgame.*Afterthought* I hope Zack Snyder does decide to finish what he has started and complete a trio of Justice League movies. This film has created a very strong foundation and will hopefully stop the production companies from getting too involved in any future films he makes. If they give him room and freedom, I think he will be able to pull off a fantastic trio of Superhero films that the fans will love!", "Snyder, You Did It.": "I remember coming out of the movie theater in 2017 when the \"original\" Justice League was released. That very film is what caused me to drift away from my optimism towards the future of the DCEU.Almost half a decade later, Synder has me hopeful once again. I didn't expect much from this film. I knew it was going to better (considering the original film is not that hard to compete with) but, my god, it is SO MUCH better.As a whole, ZSJL is a completely different movie. It isn't perfect. But it is pretty damn close. Both Flash, and Cyborg are completely revamped inside this film. You feel for both of these characters throughout all 4 hours. Firing Junkie XL, the composer, was one of the worst mistakes WB could've made for the original film. He really shows what he is capable inside Synder's version.One flaw of the new music, I would say, is the new addition to the Wonder Woman theme, with the vocal orchestra. It was almost kind of laughable.And the only other notable flaw with this film is the over-use of slow motion. It's everywhere inside this film. You can't escape it. But I understand that many die-hard comic fans live for those type of shots. So for their sake, this really is understandable inside a superhero movie like this.These two \"flaws\" are what makes this movie not a perfect 10/10. But those are the only two problems I had with this movie.The 4 hour length was no problem for me. In fact, it was much needed. The slow-burning pacing of the first half is what causes you, as an audience member, to connect with these characters. Snyder brings so much more to the table when it comes to character development in the first 2 hours of this movie. This addition, by far, is my favorite part of the movie.I'm still shocked that this wasn't the movie I saw back in 2017. I will never understand why Warner Brothers trashed the majority of what was featured in this film.Snyder, you did it. And I pray that this isn't the end for Zack. I wouldn't say I'm a die hard fan of the DCEU or the MCU but I now understand why people are so passionate about restoring the \"Snyderverse.\"I pray this isn't the end.Zack Snyder's Justice League is a MUST WATCH. Especially for those who were scarred from the original, like I was.", "Feels like Justice League Animated": "I enjoyed everything about this movie. I felt like a child who was watching his heroes for the first time. It's amazing, Superman is really the GOAT. Thank you Zack and Debbie. #ForAutumn", "This movie was fantastic": "I consider this the definitve dceu Justice League. The movie was everything the other version wasn't. It was a smart, well told story. Each character shined and had an arc. I loved it.", "A breath of fresh air": "This new version of Snyder proves that the 2017 movie means nothing. Snyder did the best one cannot imagine, a mythical superhero fantasy movie fascinated me.", "It was what we needed. It was enough.": "So last night, around 2 am I finished the Zack Snyder's Justice League. It was the best superhero stuff I have ever watched. I will regard than even Batman Trilogy because Nolan's Batman was more like existentialist action drama than just a superhero film. On the other hand, this was purely a superhero masterpiece. It has rewarded me with such satisfaction that I feel no more need to ever watch a superhero film again. I might never watch a superhero film again. Zack Synder did justice to the Justice League. It might have not been perfect, or rather far from that, but it was enough. It was what I have always wanted and I got it. A peace that did not come with existential crises. I loved it.", "4 hrs of Greatness!": "Let me start of by saying that I am a DC fan so I have watched and read about all these characters growing up. However there are films in the DCEU that after watching, I didnt much care about so going into this film i was a little skeptical.\nBoy oh boy!.... Was i pleased. This movie is fantastic. Every single detail put into developing the characters and how as a viewer, I started caring about them really made me want to watch more.\nGranted there were some issues, I felt , especially with the bg score and the repeated mess of the same but that didnt stop me from throrogjly enjoying this movie .\n4 hrs was just a breeze and infact left me wanting for more. I really hope we see where this leads. I guess it's time to get on the #restorethesnyderverse train!", "Overlong tosh": "4 long self indulgent hours of utter rubbish.\nBetter than the 2017 but only because the ludicrous running time allows to show more behind each character.\nHowever the overuse of slo mo is ridiculous, steppenwolf and cyborg still look terrible. And the whole thing is frankly boring.", "The movie we actually wanted. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster of emotions.": "If you saw the original, and hoped this movie redeemed itself, by god you have found it. The Zack Snyder Justice League is coherent, Cyborg and Flash finally have the character development they deserve, and a story line that actually makes sense and has no nonsense (cough cough mustache). The movie does start out slow, but what else do we expect when you are introducing three new and major characters from scratch? Cyborg's and Flash's character development puts you on a rollercoaster of emotions. Throughout the movie I found myself almost in tears, to on the edge of my seat. If you thought this was anything like the original, you're in the wrong place.", "Truly incredible!": "Truly incredible! Honestly watching it breaks my heart that they didn't release this the first time as it makes me want a sequel and the likelihood of one is to slime.\nOnly flaws was how much slow motion was used it began to be very annoying especially when it was put it stupid spots. However it was made in 2017 so slow motion was a big thing back then.\nOther than that amazing movie!!! Honestly can't believe they were so stupid not to release this version to begin with.", "What DC fans actually deserved!": "Okay so I watched Josstice League in theaters and I never felt betrayed as much as when I watched it. The Justice League mean way too much to me to see some corporate greediness ruin them for their own benefits! It is disgusting what they did to this film (on & behind the scenes). But I've finally got the Justice League I always loved and respected with Zack Snyder's Justice League! Each character (even the villains) gets its own time to shine and each one of them get the development and arc they deserve. They have been respected and not being nerfed or dumbed down for jokes. The Score & the cinematography are amazingly good. The actors/actresses did a good job with the characters they are playing. Overall this really is a Masterpiece. And it is the redemption of the DCEU. I hope we could see more of these characters in the future. And one last thing... #RestoreTheSnyderVerse !", "A new hope for DCEU": "So much potential I see in DCEU after watching the Zack Snyder's Justice League. 4 hours felt so short for me.", "One of the best superhero movie": "One of the best movie i've ever seen, steppenwolf, finally feels badass and he feels alive, because SemenWolf from Josstice league was pure cgi monster without feelings and motivation. And cyborg real surprised me, now when he got good background - he one of the best characters in film. The flash also pretty good, scene from the ending where the flash back in time - fantastic, in the Josstice league he maximum have been a clown. In this movie poor graphics, but it looks better than Josstice league. At all i can say, snydercut it's really good movie, what really close to masterpiece kind of Man of steel or infinite war", "Finally DC has done it!": "I was disappointed seeing the previous addition of JL, But Zack Snyder cut purely nailed it. Now can't wait till the next releases.", "Perfectly made": "I loved the marvel movies, but as a kid growing up I was a fan of DC cartoons, not really marvel. I loved Batman, Superman, and Justice League. The Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy had me wanting more, and when the original Justice League was announced I was ready to relive all the amazing stories from my childhood. Unfortunately it sucked and was a major letdown in every way.This movie however, was perfectly made. It transposes all the emotion and action of those cartoons, along with the darkness of the DC universe and Batman in particular. It presents each character well and intertwines their stories in seamless fashion. The movie does not feel long at all-the action scenes are exactly what I wanted, showcasing every hero's strengths, and the dramatic sequences are well filmed and engaging.I can't wait for the next one!", "I want more..": "This is what DC universe is all about.. Dark, serious, action, and a little bit emotional storytelling. Even for non DC fans (like my friend) you will really enjoy watching this movie (he did). The story had a perfect ending but at the same time It lift me wanting to see more, I hope that WB & Zack Snyder consider creating a sequel.", "Thank you Snyder!": "I can't explain my feelings! Four hours of enjoyment, Four hours of happiness, Four hours of tears! Four hours of love, and four hours of darkness! I mean I feel like I've been waiting my whole life for this! Thank you Snyder! And everyone who had a role in saving the Snyder's cut of JL, THANK YOU! It was worthy for every minute i spent in waiting for four years since 2017 and four hours of watching this incredible, magnificence and amazing movie.\nThe movie was more than satisfying for not only Snyder's fans, but all of DC's fandoms! It revealed a lot of things that we didn't know before, and opened a new world for DC extended universe!\nIn the end.. I really don't know how to say that, but we are truly deeply sorry for the tragedy of Autumn's death. I mean I can't imagine how hard it is for Snyder and his family to live with that every day.. may her soul rest in peace.", "WHAT A WONDERFUL RIDE that movie was!!!!": "ZSJL was everything we wanted and moooore!\nHe fixed all the horrible problems with the 2017 version (which I hope we'll all forget soon enough).\nNow ZSJL is a movie we can all stand behind and support to get a sequel.\n#RestoreTheSnyderverse !!!", "The movie should have been theatrical version.": "Zack Snyder Justice league is the better movie in every department as compared to theatrical version. The movie is 4 hour long that is exhausting even if you are massive fan of DC characters but it offer much to context to character and storyline.The action sequences are top notch and movie doesn't have a single continuity error. I love the new score especially the new amazon score. Zack is not good a fit for the DC films but dude did everything it can to deliver a massive scale superhero team up movie. I enjoyed every second of it.", "Worth the wait.": "This film is nothing like the original cut so don't let that put you off. I was amazed at the character build we so needed in the first cut. You do find yourself saying this was in the original but not this is way???? It sends the film into a new direction and would be a shame and waste of time and money not to make a second. You have heard the fans option, it works do it.", "Should have been a 8 part Series": "Great movie. I love all the character and story development that was missing from the previous. I almost didn't watch it because of the 4 hour run time. I think this would have been more appealing to have it presented as 8 parts on HBO max like a \"limited series\" style.", "The movie we deserved": "I am so glad we got to see snyders vision come to the screen after all this time. Well worth it. Thank you! #restorethesnyderverse", "Epic. So much better than the other version": "Not much to say. Set aside the 4 hours and watch it, every second is worth it.", "Restore Snyderverse DCEU is A Must now": "Unbelievable good and different from the 2017 version. Well done Zack!", "The hero we needed and right now": "This was the Justice League we should of had, loved it, have actually watched it twice already and loved it even more the second time.The character development is key for me, Cyborg and Flash are such good characters felt I knew nothing about them in the previous version, in this one I did especially cyborg and the performance from Ray Fisher in that role, such a shame we will not see the continuing of the story", "The way this movie should have been in the first place": "This is how the move should have been originally. Truly a masterpiece.", "LORD OF THE RINGS SUPERHERO EDITION": "Simply put this movie is a masterpiece. Dont let butthurt marvel fans fool you. This piece of art is so worth your time and money. The dedication and effort put in by zack snyder to depict his such an ambitious vision clearly shows here", "SNYDERVERSE IS THE BEST THING HAPPENED FOR DC FANS": "It's such an amazing VFX with detailed work each and every story line dialogue and frames are just mesmerising if you are watching it for the 1st time this one is masterpiece by ZACK for you all just sit back and enjoy 4 hours long movie with Ur favourite snacks", "WOW!!": "ALl I can say is that this was hands down 100 times better than the 'original' one that we got. Its literally like 2 different movies, minus a few scenes. I was blown away by how good it actually was. If your on the fence about watching this please dont be. You wont be disappointed.. The movie is presented in 4:3 instead of wide-screen, but trust me like 30 mins in you will forget all about it because it just grabs your attention..", "Maybe a little better maybe": "Lots of useless scenes and sombody tell someone in charge to stop with the music that plays every time wonder woman does something (really stupid) graphics were better but thats hinde sight for ya was this zacks vision from the start no i dont believe that for a min", "Absolutely Incredible": "The entire cast put on a performance of a lifetime. I can not believe that all this was filmed (aside from a few minutes that was filmed in 2020) in 2016 and WB completely picked it apart and reshot so much, butchering it. This version flows so effortlessly following from BvS and continues the story arcs. The fight scenes, the emotional scenes, even the humous scenes were simply phenomenal. It was everything I hoped for in 2017 and more", "Zack snyder cut is amazing": "This film is better than 2017, has an amazing story and you end the movie asking for more.\nnow we can understand more about cyborg and flash", "Bro I'm so emotional right now": "I'm the biggest critic on everything. Especially when it comes to comic book adaptation to movies. The last justice league movie disappointed so much it made me hate literally everything. This is how a movie experience should be made. Hard middle finger to Mcu. This was a experience. This was a defibrillator to my heart too all dc. Zack your are dc when it comes to movies. I don't cry much brother. But damn dude thank you for going out of your way to do this. I hope HBO paid you. I send all my love too you and yours. Watch this. Change your perception.", "If the Zack Universe is abandoned, as long as DC is still under Warner's banner, I will never watch new DC movies.": "This is not for Zack Snyder, but as DC fan, Warner's credibility in my heart has bankrupted. I have been looking forward to the Justice League since the 1990s, when Tim Burton planned to reboot the Superman movie. As a result, it fell into the hell of development, and finally made Superman Return. I also accepted it. As long as it can link with the Dark Knight, but this plan was abandoned. In fact, when the Man of steel moive first came out, I didn't accept it very much. At that time, I preferred the Reeve's version of the superman. I just thought that Zack's version was an alien called Kal-el, not Superman. But after the BVS movie, I accepted this style instead, looking forward to the next movie. But at last, like everybody konws, we've got a terrible version of the Justice League movie.\nEven Marvel's films were not evey one of them good , and they are willing to slowly spread out with single-player movies. And here in WB, I can also see WB is anxious to achieve quick success and get instant benefits even in a theather, and see WB holding a whip behind the back, demanding that each one of the movies must be perfect.\nZack Universe is very likely to be abandoned. Since then, I will not watch any new DC movies in the future unless WB keep the Zack Universe or DC leaves the WB's banner.", "A Redemption for DCEU": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best comic books based movies of all time and let me tell you why. Firstly, it's obviously better than Whedon's version. The Whedon version was choppy, too colourful, zero darkness, zero real violence and full of bad jokes. This movie is what people can call a 4 hour binge of goodness. From the first scene to the last this movie is mind-blowing..\nTo start with the cinematography, it's amazing. Every slow motion, every added graphic, was just mind-blowing. Along with the new editing, which is realistic in its own way. The colour grading is what you expect from a DCEU movie. The acting was good. Gal Gadot, fine. Henry Cavill, fine. Ben Affleck, great. But this movie does wonders with Ezra Miller's Flash, Jared Leto's Joker and Ray Fischer's Cyborg. This movie finally does justice to the complex DC characters..\nYeah, now to compare it with Marvel. Sure this movie is not as good as Infinity War. Personally, I feel it's better than Endgame but I think people are forgetting, this is the first Justice League film. And surely, the Whedon Justice League was the worst but this movie is as good as the first avengers movie..\nIn a way, I can say this that this movie does place DC in a new light. They are improving. And as someone who always liked DC characters more than Marvel, it's good to see DCEU improving..\nTo say the least now I think Warner Bros should now realise that creative freedom is important. Everytime they interfere the project is done. #restorethesnyderverse.", "Wow..... Zack Snyder. Good job!!!": "After watching the Snyder cut...... the other one doesn't exist anymore .\ud83d\ude0e", "Far supersedes the botched theatrical cut": "An infinitely better movie.

WB need to be congratulated on listening to fans and putting inbthe effort to correcting a \"wrong\"!The snyder cut, which i for one will be referring to as the definitive Justice League movie from now on, gave me goosebumps at times and I was in shock and awe in others.... how could this have been deemed as the lesser of the versions of the movies by anyone is beyond me! But I am glad we got to see it in all of its glory.It is not without its flaws, I am sure if it were to have a conventional theatrical release, the movie would have been slimmed down a little, but for me personally, I didn't even notice the 4 plus house hour runtime, I was thoroughly engrossed in the story and the spectacle... n surely as fans this is what we want first and foremost!I thank warner brothers and zak snyder, for giving us this movie, when it would have been so easy, easier in fact for the studio to put this on a shelf and forget about it, and possibly for zak due to the huge personal tragedy he went through during initial production.", "Possibly one of the best superhero movies!!": "I gotta admit, I was very sceptical at first.

Therefore he had to rewrite and we can feel this. Some things are toned down, and more subtle comedy is introduced.However, I am so happy how things turned out. This #Snydercut movement have given the ability to Snyder to his movie his way! And even if he couldn't re-write the movie, he really is able to realise his vision in this version! Steppenwolf is the perfect example. All characters are really flushed out (which I guess wouldn't be the case if he released it in 2017 because of runtime/studio pressure).Well this movie is a really good movie! Seeing the characters, their arc and their story, its a beautiful movie.

The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize. Honestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film. Zack Snyder is truly amazing", "A good super hero movie": "Action is good but gal gadot acting is very very bad\nZack snayder is a medium director\nThis good for a see", "Pure magic!": "Its incredible what zack snyder was able to pull off in this 4 hour epic, a far cry from the cut up and re shot mess Whedon delivered in 2017. This is the first movie i've ever reviewed here because it just was THAT good and i need to make that known to anyone considering to see it. There's a great story here, complete character arcs, amazing action set pieces, awe inspiring to say the least, every single emotional beat was hit. Cyborg is an absolute delight and the biggest change, in Josstice league he was a nothing character, no motivations or time given to develop him, he was just there, huge disservice to Ray Fishers amazing rendition of the character and made clear there was a bias against him on the cutting room floor, I hope he gets to continue the story because it's just unfair not to let him do it. Every single character improved for the better and while I was not expecting a lot I loved this movie, I see myself rewatching it multiple times and would really love seeing the snyderverse's further development, it's a perfect jumpstart to Barry's and Victor's individual stories, it already connects great with the amazing Aquaman movie we got from James Wan, and WW could also continue from where we left off given that all her movies have been in the past, Henry Cavill is great as always, I heard he's out along with Battfleck and that's a DAMN shame because he IS superman, I liked man of steel and there's definitely potentional to keep building on this. Battfleck I never really loved but this movie sold me a little more on Ben's incarnation (I still want Battinson though, that's sure to be great and one of the things I didn't like about Battfleck was that he was an already aged Batman, all the fun storylines already happened and Battinson is just a fresh start). I hope somehow they can make the multiverse work and we can keep all these amazing actors. Beyond excited for DC's future.", "Justice league the fans deserve": "All the chapter of Snyder's JL are very well put together to establish character development and for future movies.Totally awesome!!!", "A gem of a comic book movie": "It is a treat to comic book fans, it treats the characters with respect and takes it's time to naturally unravel the plot while giving each character attention.\nIt's well paced, well written, well directed and overall well acted.Other than pride, I have no idea why WB would be so strongly against this film being released. WB would be losing out on a lot of money and a strong fanbase if they don't go forward with the originally planned sequels for this film.\nThe fanbase is strong and the demand is high.", "DC fan boy's over reacting": "It's a ok film nothing more than that.

Saying something would be too much. You have to experience it for yourself.", "Mostly better than original....": "I liked alot of the added parts and most of the cuts from the original. Won't go into every one. The extra character building was a nice touch. More details in several scenes was nice too. I'm sure a ton of people didn't like the 4 hour length, but movies of this magnitude deserve time and not to be rushed.I certainly didn't like this version of Steppenwolf's looks nor his voice. Both were better in original. Even his minions were better looking in the original.One last thing that irked me in both versions was when reviving superman, why wasn't Lois Lane arranged o be the first person superman sees. I mean, batman is suppose to be some sort of genius, but this simpleton thought isn't even thought of. It Begs my question why batman is even talked about when it comes to the likes of superhumans & immortals. I think him & iron man characters are a joke.", "Working union with Bad pay checks": "You C D cover! Maybe You know them, maybe You don't...", "Epic and breathtaking!": "Although it would've been presented in 3.5 hr runtime at best. This movie is epic and breathtaking.

I was so close to being done with DC.This Cut gives me hope for the future, and somehow the characters are more likeable.When I first watched the original I wasn't a fan of most of the characters.... Now I want to see what the future has in store :)", "The movie that everyone believed was myth that delivered what fans wanted.": "This movie is definitely ambitious with fitting so many characters into one story. This cinematic universe is a bit darker than what people are used to seeing on screen but DC comics has always been dark. The pacing was a bit off at times but when it hit the points, it really hits.\nThank you Zack and fans for bringing this story to life.", "DC WB Masterpiece": "At last a great movie that gives DC the greatest that it deserves, especially to the fans.", "About Time!": "Perfection! This movie was absolute perfection! The idiot critics that gave this movie a negative review have either been paid off by competitors, are friends of the WB idiot that pushed the first JL, or tragically have no taste.

Zack Snyder needs to become the leader of the DCU!", "A Thrilling Ride From Start To Finish!": "The comic book colors you're used to... well, this ain't that. The experience is a mood. I said, a MOOD. And It's beautiful, from music to action to our heroes and their stories. Everything about that one very special guy is in its proper place don't you worry about it. I was wide-eyed from 2:00AM CDT when ZSJL first dropped on HBO Max. I just finished my second watch, and now I need to go back to bed! I'm going to sleep until I can't, then get up to watch it again.", "What the DCU deserves.": "The Snyder's Cut is a COMPLETELY different storyline than the original.

I really hope a sequel gets made.", "It's really a very good example to see how board of any company can destroy it": "When I watch Justice league 2017, I didn't believe it's coming from Zack Snyder, everything is clear now how board can destroy everything with their touch.\nYes I know time more than 4 hours but there are many ways to make in good time not but this way we saw in 2017 version.\nAnyway thanks Zack for this great work.", "What I thought": "Pros:\nIt is much better than the theathrical release including character developmet for Wonder Woman, Cyborg and a less suicideal batman. Less of the posed smiling paticularly from the beautiful Gal Gadot. Henry Cavill gets the black suit, Cyborg gets a storyline. Finally Flash is actually good and far less cringy.\nAffleck and Gadot had amazing chemistry and dropping the Steve Trevor grief subplot really helpedCons: the abusive levels of slow motion, this could have been 3 hours. If they were too keep the slow motion for the Fash scenes which was a good idea they should have been dropped from everyone else.\nIt did not need to be R Rated, bad language was put in to push it to an R the violence wasnt enough for that.All over while sometimes long it and I wasnt ever really sold on the Snyderverse it is a significant improvement on the honestly painful and disappointing but not the most worst of the DC movies.Worth a try and honestly I'm glad it was made. I would definately try a Batfleck movie/series or a sequel to this. Hoping they retain Gadot, Affleck and Cavill as their characters.", "Finally they let him do his own thing instead of playing catch up with Marvel": "The movie is such a thrilling ride! This is the real deal! The movie is at par with Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 and the infinity war. It doesn't try to be a funny action flick and just focuses at what true heroes really are! Each character has been finally redeemed and have become much closer to their comic book versions for example- Batman is finally a selfless hero, WW and Aquaman are badasses, Superman is a kind soul, flash is a joy and cyborg is very realistic and relatableThe movie is a really big improvement over it's prequels and needless to say over Josstice League\nThe pacing is great but could've avoided some of the slow mo.\nEach characters motives including the villians are very well portrayed and the story telling is so much better than the earlier ovies of DCEU.\nCGI quite impressive in most scenes.\nThe movie is totally worth all the fight that the fans put up for it's release.\nDC has so much potential! It is a brand with the potential of making the biggest cinematic universe of all time, the only thing that has hurt it so much is WB itself. WB has no clue as to how to take this universe forward, they should let it grow like the DC animated by doing their own thing and not copying stupid movies like age of ultron. The josstice league was definitely a poor man's age of ultron.", "Breathe of fresh air": "Absolutely brilliant. I don't usually write reviews but I had to this time. I love both DC and Marvel. Marvel definitely has been the leaders whilst DC has the strongest roster to work with. Justice league theatrical cut had massive problems, for reasons that were personal and unfortunate. Would we have seen the Snyder cut otherwise? I want to thank Mr. Snyder and team, and the fandom for making this happen. What does this mean? Despite the quotes with Snyder, this is definitely a marker for the future od the DC universe involving Snyder in opinion. It's definitely open fur more with the same characters, especially the arc between Batman, Deathstroke and the Joker. This is DC back where it belongs.More please, at last DC has hit the mark.", "Truly an EPIC": "What a great movie. The real villians of this movie are WB.\nWB should restore the synderverse.", "Finally answers the WHYs": "Why does Steppenwolf want to unite the motherboxes and destroy Earth?\nWhy should we care about Cyborg?\nWhy is Batman on a recruitment drive?It finally answers these questions and gives a purpose to the movie.And then, it gives some badassery to Flash and Wonder Woman.A hugely transformed and improved film from the 2017 disaster.", "The First DC movie that left me wanting more!": "I was afraid this movie was going to be another trash DC movie and boy was I wrong! After 4 hours I thought I would be glad it was over, not the case. The only disappointment is finding out they have no intentions on continuing the story. I grew to like Ben Affleck playing Batman which I had hated in the past. DC needs more of this and less ofvthe trash they are putting out. Besides the Dark knight, it is the only one that is as good as the marvel movies. DC would be great if they all had a great story line like this. I have zero desire to watch the movies they have slated for the rest of 2021.", "good, but requires patience": "I went into this movie not nesicarally knowing what to expect as I had not scene the original cut of the movie, so I would take this review with a grain of salt. This film is very much a slow burn and I believe it works better as such, with the wide variety of characters that we don't have a lot of background on (unless you've seen Aquaman or the Wonder Woman movies) I think fleshing out the characters more with its runtime does help its story astronomically. That is another thing that people seem to have an issue with, its runtime. With the movie hitting the 4hr mark it does slog on at some parts as well as having some janky CGI that took me out of the viewing experience although those moments are few and far in-between. So if you have the time to sit down and watch this film I would suggest it, even though I had taken multiple breaks throughout its entirety I did enjoy myself with this flick (even though I believe it would've worked better as an OVA series).", "Best DC comic movie in this decade": "The way change the action scene and detail for collect the group by batman much better than the last version wating for next chapter \ud83d\ude0d", "Best of Snyder": "Must match awsome movie and I want the squeal to be continued #restorethesnyderverse.", "JUSTICE!!!": "This movie shows us why Snyder is one of the best in the business.

Nobody can beat him in term of Dark Flevered movie.", "Best DCEU FILM till now!": "This movie is pure magic. Zack Snyder has made this movie with so much intensity, it shows. BEST JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE EVER!", "Its better than theatrical version": "Its good, it really is, if you are comparing it to the theatrical release. Better in nearly all aspects. But I don't see an improvement in story. Someone commented that this movies reveals the real reason of superman's sacrifice; it doesn't. The fights and story is almost similar to the theatrical one, just some more explanations and character built up. If you compare with Marvel movies this one cannot beat Civil War let alone Infinity War or Endgame ( Don't get me wrong, Personally I like DC characters better than Marvel ones). Batman portrayed here is weaker than the actual character. Still its a pretty good watch so I rated it 8/10, I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't watched the theatrical release first.", "Zack Snyder's Atonement": "Yes, the pacing is too slow, the visual effects still aren't completed and there is too much extraneous \"wouldn't it be cool\" moments. Nonetheless, this is a vast improvement over what was released in the theaters. It looks like Snyder finally understands that the DC heroes are supposed to be beacons of light in a very dark universe.\nThere are still plot holes and too many coincidences but at least there is a coherent story this time out.\nNothing can ever totally absolve Snyder for the atrocities that were Man of Steel and BvS, but this film feels like a love letter after those other visual pukefests.", "I've just watched the \"Snyder cut Justice League\" film and I want more.": "I've just watched the \"Snyder cut Justice League\" film and I want more.\nThe biggest question I have after sitting through this ( long, long, long ) film is \"What if?\" What if Warner bros weren't cowards and allowed a respected film director to take full control of his vision? What if \"Batman V Superman\" isn't great due to the busy bodies up above trying to implement their own wants ahead of the art of movie making? What if Warner Bros allows the fans to see more of the universe Snyder has created? The Snyder cut isn't the perfect film but it is a hell of a lot better than the cinema release that came out in 2017.For those of you who don't know, film director Zack Snyder was given the incredibly difficult task of bringing the DC cinematic universe up to the high standards set by Marvel. He had worked with DC related material before by directing DC's \"Watchmen\" for the big screen, he was also the man in charge of bringing Dark Horse's \"300\" to cinemas starring Gerrard Butler as \"Leonidas\".\nHis first task in setting up a DC universe was bringing back Superman to the forefront of public consciousness.Trying to make America's boy scout more relevant in today's world was no easy task but I believe his version of the kryptonian in \"Man of Steel'' was incredible. Zack Snyder and the taleneted cast of that film made Superman cool again, no longer was he this geeky, goody two shoes, saving cats from trees and helping the elderly cross the road but a butch beefcake that gave you no trouble in believing he could crush a lorry into a cube with his bare hands. Snyder brought a sense of realism into the film (following suit from Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy) whilst introducing Aliens and science fiction into a brand that moved away from that years ago.Man of Steel was a commercial success and fans were excited for a sequel. Although Henry Cavill has appeared in a number of films as Superman, a true \"Man of Steel\" sequel never came to be, instead we were treated with the news that the next film to star Superman was to also star the Dark Knight.\nIn my opinion this was down to the high ups at Warner Bros trying to rush a shared movie universe instead of following the path set up by Marvel and develop a set of core characters, story arcs and nuances audiences could begin to love before mixing characters together. The decision to make Synder's second film \"Batman V Superman : Dawn of Justice'' was the beginning of the end of this Universe.You could tell this whole thing was being rushed when they announced that joining Superman and Batman in the second film would be Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman, many fans and critics were quoted in saying this seems to be \"too much too soon\" and would stop any real character development due to the overcrowding of main characters, they were right.Zack Synder got a lot of the blame for the poor reviews of this film and it has only just occurred to me, after seeing his cut of Justice League, that the blame aimed towards him was unfair and not justified. Although the reviews were not great it was still considered a financial success leading to the suits at Warner Bros allowing Snyder to continue as the director for Justice League, the fact Snyder had already started making Justice league straight after wrapping up BvS also helped them come to the decision.Rumours came out during the making of Justice league that studio heads were not happy with the making of Justice League, they weren't happy with the cost of the production and the length of the film, Snyder had openly stated that he wanted this to be a 2 film project but the studio only wanted to make one film and keep it under 2 hours in length. There was clear tension and creative differences between the film's director and the Studio.As the film was getting close to being wrapped up Zack Snyder's daughter Autumn, committed suicide leaving the whole Synder family distraught. A press release was swiftly put out stating Zach Snyder would be stepping down from his role as director to be with his family. Although this is a completely understandable decision to make it has been reported that the studio decided to use this heartbreaking event as a reason to remove him from the film and bring in someone that would fall in line with their wants, either way Zack Snyder was gone.Warner Bros hired \"Avengers\" director Joss Whedon to finish the filming, edit a film that would last no longer than 2 hours and be appealing to a wide spectrum of movie goers that would continue the desire for more films from the DC comics \"big hitters\". He managed to achieve 2 of the 3 objectives, the latter being missed by a large margin. Before the release of the 2017 version of the film, Whedon was vocally distancing himself from the film, stating he wasn't really the director but just someone that came in to help complete Snyder's vision, probably betting there would never be an opportunity for Zach Snyder to release his own / original version. Joss Whedon even tried to distance himself from the mess of a film by putting his name, during the opening credits, over the image of a homeless man holding a sign saying \"I tried\".The film flopped and so did the shared cinematic universe of DC characters. Further films were released with DC characters but the desire or want to join these characters up were gone, Ben Affleck had hung up his cowl and Henry Cavill had gone on to different projects and refused to openly commit to reprising his role of superman.Cut to the year 2020, and a social media campaign had really started to make noise, the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut hashtag was getting real momentum and Zack Snyder himself was pouring fuel on the flames by publicly sharing his vision of the film and saying he had filmed enough to be able to release his version of the film. This all coincided with the announced launch of HBOmax a streaming service from Warner Bros, the Streaming service execs decided to commission Synder to create his version of the film and it would be released on the streaming service, guaranteeing a large number of subscriptions from film fans desperate to see what Snyder wanted to create.Zack Snyder did just that and edited a 4 hour version of \"Justice League\" and it is so much better than the 2017 version. After watching this film, I want more of these characters, I want more of this universe, I want more of Snyder's vision. I hope more people feel the same as me and Warner Bros listen. I hope the positivity of this version is enough for Ben Affleck to be persuaded back to a role (I believe) he is perfect for. I hope Henry Cavill also feels the love for his portrayal of \"The man of Steel\" and opts to return.This doesn't mean I don't want to see Robert Pattison's run as \"The Dark Knight\", It is my opinion that you can never have enough Batman. It just means I want to see more of the universe created by Zack Snyder, I want to see how he concludes his story.", "#restorethesnyderverse.": "Nothing but perfection !

But it's still Justice League and however much you tweak this it won't change the fact that it's not a good movie. I'm certain DC fanboys will love it but for neutral fans the Snyder Cut is way too long, and ultimately most people will find it boring and not enjoyable.\nSo I give this 5 stars, not good, not bad, too long and the moral of the story is that no amount polish can turn this into gold.\nIf you want good superhero movies you really need to turn to MCU and try to forget the whole DCEU thing ever happened.", "A Justice League movie for the ages": "This is DC at its best, this movie is EPIC! Zack Snyder's vision for these characters is grandiose and full of heart. The ideas and story points introduced in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman are both continued and evolved in this movie and the visuals have never been more spectacular. The heroes who were deconstructed in Snyder's previous movies, are reconstructed here. During this long ride, the story builds naturally and there is time to invest in the characters. Every character gets his/her moment to shine multiple times, but Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) are standouts. The grand action set pieces and the small, intimate scenes are all feel at place, the pacing is perfect, the movie flows beautifully. This is Zack Snyder's best film to date and leaves and other significant mark on the history of comic book movies.

I enjoyed this from start to finish, the backstories of the characters we don't know very well were perfect, the soundtrack was perfect, the action was full tilt, the overall movie was fantastic. Hopefully WB will realise what an asset they have in the justice league and will give Snyder the money and blessing to make a sequel with you know who coming back, and do not worry about it being 4 hours, if it's too long WB split it in half and release them a month apart in the cinema.", "Far exceeded expectations": "Just an absolute masterpiece. It's what the original should have been.", "Dark colour scheme to hide CGI": "This is a very good film and much better than the 2017 version. The new characters get their own story arcs that really bring depth.The film is so heavily reliant on cgi that it's colour scheme is very dark. There are hardly any daytime scenes. This is a trick used to reduce the cgi budget as it's easier to make cgi look right in the dark. It's much harder to have realistic cgi for scenes in bright daylight. Pacific rim used a similar trick.I was looking forward to the 4K version of this film but as the colour scheme is so dark I don't think 4K will add much.", "Favorite comic film!": "My favorite comic film since the Watchmen and TDKR!\nZack created an epic development in 9.5 hours with his trilogy, while exploring many possibilities and setting up many sequels for the DC multiverse!\nThat's greatness!

This 4 hr epic movie never felt dull for a single minute. Actors acted and engaged well. Storytelling was miles better than Zack's previous works. And the highlight was THE VISUALS. Unbelievably beautiful and mythical. Every scene was shot like it's a fantasy world. I always prefered CGI which looked realistic but this movie looked literally a fantasy. And it was beautiful.

A pompous film based on lazy fan services, with a clumsy plot and a worse script. Not a single dialogue capable of empathizing with the adult audience to whom it claims to be directed. Not a single memorable scene. A collection of bad CGI and LOT slow motion used without any narrative logic. Probably the worst Zack Snyder movie to date. Forgettable from start to finish.", "A decent movie that was definitely better than the original but not amazing either": "Zack Snyder's cut of the Justice League is vastly different to the original in a good way, but is it worth to watch? Sure its worth it to watch the movie if you want to see the contrast between the original and this, its also worth it to watch this movie if you have the time and are pretty invested in the DC universe. But honestly if you don't really care about the movie or the universe then there's no point wasting 4 hours on watching this. Although I did enjoy parts of this movie including the fight scenes and ACTUALLY HAVING A SOLID BACKSTORY FOR CYBORG, there is still a lot of excess things in the movie that just take up time and the movie would be better without. I didn't really like the music choice in this movie but obviously that's completely subjective, and although the colours on the film weren't to my taste, I totally understand what Zack Snyder was trying to do with the movie. The first 2 hours of the movie before the climax is honestly pretty boring but i get why its nessacary, but surely Zack Snyder could've trimmed it down? This isn't really too much of an issue though because when the climax happens in this movie it is actually really well taken, I also love the ending compared to the originals' where instead of hurting Steppenwolf and him going away, they instead lost dramatically and the world basically becomes a post apocalyptic desert. That ending caught me completely off guard but honestly I really like it.Overall the movie definitely had some highlights to it and was light years better than the original. The reason why I'm giving it a 7/10 is because of the length, song choice and slow pace of the movie. Still a good movie though and if you want to watch it go ahead, but if you don't have the time for a 4 hour movie, you honestly don't need to go out of your way unless the DC universe is a massive priority to you.", "ZS-JL a Masterpiece": "A Masterpiece of the all time.

I know 4 hours seems like a long time but if you are involved with the movie then you are at the end before you know it. Mr Snyder you need to make the second and third now please as it would be tragic if that is how it is left. To all the actors, please reprise your roles especially Ben Affleck as how could you make another JL without one of the main characters.

Next the fact hes working with joker I cringed at seeing jay leto as joker again (worst joker ever). Also now Martian Man Hunter shows up but does not help the team dystroy that which is going to ruin the planet he now calls home -_- please. Just a few of the things that bugged me. Action scenes were well done and sound was great which did do some justice for this movie.", "Amazing Redemption of an Underrated Director": "This film, the original Justice League that we should have gotten in 2017, is unparalleled when it comes to superhero films. The cinematography, score and action are all amazing, and so are the heroes and villains, who are all characterized brilliantly.\nWe actually feel like we're part of a DC comics story, not just some random, childish morning cartoon like the 2017 version. No, this version is more meaningful and deep. Has more heart and hope while being more violent and badass.

Now to the movie itself.. The reward for the extended length of the movie is that you get a much more deeper understanding of key characters, their stories, and the overall story arc of the movie itself. I particularly really loved how this version changes the vibe and understanding of Barry Allan from just a bumbling joker in the 2017 theatrical release to the cool hero we all come to love, Cyborg becomes so much more interesting and a clear understanding of what drives the agenda of Steppenworlf, his relationship to Darkseid and why Darkseid should be truely feared. The improvements in visual effects & music score is clear to see and hear and in my humble opinion Snyder's cut is overall a vast upgrade to the 2017 version, with this version making the story telling so much more coherent, in line to previous Snyder's DC movies and clearly shows how much butchery went on back in 2017 after Warner and Joss Whedon stepped in to take over the reins. I have my fingers crossed that the Zack Snyder's cut becomes canon being it sits perfectly alongside MOS and Batman vs Superman (extended cut) and opens the doors for Justice League 2 or even a number 3 to complete the story arc. Bravo to all that championed for this cut release over the years, it was truely worth the wait!", "What should have been": "This is the best thing that could've happened to this movie which it did and now we all need a sequel to this series or rather a Snyderverse.", "Absolute garbage": "Unnecessary slow motion scenes dragged the movie longer than it should be. The movie has a weird and irritating wonder woman theme. Unnecessary scenes which makes no sense. Scenes like the group of women singing for whatever reason and sniffing on aquaman's jacket. Martian manhunter visiting lois makes no sense as well. Little to no action in the movie.. An absolute waste of time.. Maybe the vision Zack was to make the audience fall asleep. Trully disappointed.

It was a hell of a ride and those 4 hours went by like it was 2 hours 20 minutes movie.Everything is better Epic story and screenplay by Chris Terrio(oscar winner writer) and Zack Snyder. I don't have to mention the visuals and cinematography bcz it is Zack Snyder movie and you know he is master at this.\nThis is one epic movie the cast, crew and All the production people did great job making this movie.\nAs a marvel fan whole life this is a fun movie and I definitely suggest people to watch it with open mind without any premade hate for DC movies or riding the hate bandwagon because some critics and bloggers have unexplainable hate for Snyder.Watch and enjoy this epic movie.\ud83d\udd25", "EPIC!": "I honestly felt like I watched an entirely different movie than the original release.

Thank you Zack Snyder for this masterpiece, which for myself as a lifelong DC fan, is a dream come true!", "Everything making sense now": "SPOILER!!!!! Yes it is making sense now that what Zack was trying to show and how he built the world of justice league. From Man of steel to this movie, the connection and the future vision of Cyborg and Batmans'. I want to talk about Cyborg's vision of how Superman become so evilish and powerful and he cut the head of Darkseid. That was epic. Likewise in Batman's vision how joker talked about alternate timeline. And Martian Manhunter???? Who would thought how Zack invited him in the league like that. This is soooo epic and going to be bigger than marvel.", "Mind blowing": "Just saw this and i have to say I was blown away.

Wow !", "Such a great service to the fans": "Great remake really appreciate snyder creating his vision.", "Best of DC": "Zack Snyder has everything to make this heroes look awesome and he demostrates this with this movie. Best DC movie ever.", "Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time!": "While the 2017 version of Justice League was a major disappointment to DC and non-DC fans alike, the Snyder cut is a massive improvement, and when I say massive...I mean massive. You'd expect to get bored at some parts with a 4 hour long movie but that is not a thing in the Zack Snyder cut. Even in the slowest sections of the movie, I still was not bored. And I get bored easily. The movie cut into parts allows for a slow-watcher to pick up where they left off after each part; which I thought was a really smart idea with such a long film, although I watched it entirely as it felt much quicker than 4 hours. Snyder fleshed out each character marvellously here, giving so much backstory, detail and emotion to the heroes and set the stage for multiple DC movies in the near future.The action scenes were all great, while there was some overuse of the slo-mo even when it wasn't the Flash in the spotlight, this didn't stop any of the fighting from shining. One larger negative would be the CGI, although it was beautiful at many times, some points had it stand out in ways that made you snap back into reality, to the notion that it's purely CGI and that you're not fighting alongside them like you wish you were. Every hero did their part, a lot more in-depth storytelling with the Flash and Cyborg in which Cyborg received a ton more content compared to the 2017 movie. If you originally disliked Cyborg, you'll grow to love him with the Snyder cut. Everyone had a purpose. And that's what made their impact much stronger throughout those 4 hours. The Antagonist \"Steppenwolf\" also looks way cooler, more like an actual world-destroying villain and not a handsome alien prince.Overall, I'd easily call this the greatest Superhero movie of all time, and I stand by that. This throws the Avengers through the mud and shows that DC can be just as good if not better than Marvel in it's film universe. The darker, more serious tone, graphic violence, awe-inspiring shots and in-depth storytelling all added to making Zack Snyder's Justice League the literal masterpiece that it is.", "One of the best team up movies with every character defined completely and having a motive": "Full marks from my side...

Years post-2017 Theatrical and finally getting the version of JL that was always intended.Back in 2017, I watched JL at the cinema. In the last act I got up, left my seat and stretched my legs. I was that engaged. Yesterday afternoon, I sat through four hours of this version and it passed like 90 minutes. I was engaged at every point of the movie. As each act name popped up I couldn't believe how quickly time was moving.It had character development. It had incidental moments. It had meaningful segments. Characters tied together, they had backgrounds, motives, reasons. I understood far more about Cyborg (the amount of content cut there from 2017 is appalling) and The Flash, the latter playing a pivotal role towards the end and setting things up for Flashpoint oh so well.The final sequence with Steppenwolf versus JL was crafted extremely well. Superman's entrance was sublime and apart from \"that line\", which was spine-tinglingly good, we had no further quips or 2017 jollities from him. Just there on business, in his black suit to show Darkseid there was to be no mercy.It was perfection. I was happy that most of my favourite scenes from 2017 still remained, bolstering my belief that Joss Whedon added little of value off his own back.Do yourself a big favour, though. Watch Wonder Woman, Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad ahead of this. Refresh your memory, it's so worth it.WB should be ashamed of themselves at their level of interference.

Incorporating themes of depression, loneliness, feeling the need to \"fit in,\" and being different - moving and beyond beautiful.

I was a massive Marvel fan until the last two films so i stopped watching, but this was something else, i couldn't look away. I'm converted, i was confused until i recognised certain scenes, them bam my slow brain caught up and i devoured Justice league, i immediately called my son and did the wrong thing and told him all about it, I'm looking forward now to Robert Pattisons version of the Batman.

I don't think that it should've been 4 hours long but not a big deal. What bothered me was the dialogue, especially flash's lines. Also, there were a lot of scenes with songs that I feel didn't match the mood or just wasn't needed. Like when aqua man swims away in the beginning and the women sing, I could've gone without that. And the cgi wasn't great but that's not a big deal. So first half I would've rated the movie about a 7.5, but the 2nd half saved it. The movie really picks up and gets a lot better when Superman comes in. I feel like the dialogue in the 2nd half wasn't as cheesy and I'm glad.

But then after i had heard that wonder woman choir thing for the 57th time i was annoyed and bored of it, and the story telling, i see how it could have been made better many folds but the way they streched it out sooo long was boring. The only scene i think i liked was the one in the beginning where Bruce goes to meet Arthur but thats still pretty rubbish.And then Batmans attitude and personality, i have always thought this but Batman in these movies have to be the worst one i have EVER seen, it completely lacks the character that Batman is like for godsake. Why does he joke so much about his money? Hes supposed to be the dark and gritty guy who still tries to work alone even though he created a scene, yes all the other characters got long and boring stories where was Batmans? Where was his struggle even after all these years. And hes a goddamn master in so many martial arts, using the right equipment on his belt he could defeat several of those parademons if not a dousin or 2. He doesn't need to rely on a vehicle, hes Batman!And now for the big one, the villians. First of i wa promised this big epic fight in the last of the movie, what did i get? A glimpse of darkseid who saw a portal but was like \"nah me no go through\", and dont get me wrong they are probaply meant to be absolutely braindead but the heroe we just so bad that i eventually just began cheering the villians on. And steppenwolf, i know about him from the comics but other may not, all we get to know is that he has wronged Darkseid somehow and now ha to take 50k worlds to redeem himself.

Zack delivered the storyline of Victor Stone and Clark Kent so deep that we will get engage easily. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse!!\ud83d\udda4", "An astoundingly good time.": "Zack Snyder triumphantly returns to the DCEU with a masterful, character driven epic.\nFrom the first bombastic frame, to the quiet and reflective end credits over 4 hours later; it is very clear that the Director and his team had a very clear goal in mind headed into the long gestating threequel. Intimacy.\nFor all its world building & the grand stature of his storytelling, Snyder never allows the film to move too far away from the goals and ambitions of his heroes (& villains).\nEpic and grandiose in nature & scope, yet so solely focused on character and natural plot rather than spectacle, I dare to draw parallels to Peter Jackon's revered Lord of the Rings trilogy.\nThe film is smartly broken into chapters, lending the viewer the option of ingesting the film a few different ways; which will be seen as a godsend for those unable or unwilling to single sit through the films immense 4 hour run-time.\nFilm length aside, special recognition must go to composer JunkieXL; who under the pressure of creating one of the longest film scores in history, has managed to rise to the occasion and elevate the film with his musical mastery. It doesn't ALL work, but his new themes are standouts in recent years.\nWith so many spinning plates, Snyder's most impressive feat may be his effortless introduction of new, layered characters that add to the narrative in impactful and important ways that in no way detract or diminish your time with the titular league. The inclusion of Ryan Zheng as Ryan Choi equates to a natural levity in his sequences with Joe Morton's Silas Stone & acts as a great reprieve from the dark tone of the film, especially as the film closes in on its final act. It also helps heighten the importance of the missions at hand, with Snyder being able to better communicate its effect not just on humankind, but that of the etherial Amazons & reclusive Atlanteans as well.\nFrom a purely story standpoint, its obvious that broad plotpoints were cherry picked from this original vision & supplanted into the theatrically released Joss Whedon venture; and while this may give SOME pause that they are about to experience the same film as the 2017 release, this is thankfully not the case. The shared plot threads are expanded on greatly, given concrete context & (alot of) time to be explored and broken down narratively. As the film paces along (it moves very fast for something so long), one thing becomes clear. It was ALWAYS Snyder's intent to utilise the death of Superman to move these films to something tonally more palatable for general audiences. It's not the distractingly sharp left turn seen in the Whedon film, but a more natural slow build to a brighter future. Its still very much in the same vein as his previous DC projects, but its lighter in tone mostly because of the superb chemistry between the cast. Snyder characterises this slow shift in tone through the evolving outlook of Ben Affleck's Batman. A man once so bleak and violent, inspired to be and do better by the actions of the man behind the S shield, Clark Kent. Its a hefty contrast between BVS and ZSJL for Affleck, but its a welcome one that works really well here, especially amongst a cast firing on all cylinders. Snyder extracts great performances throughout, with Ray Fisher's Vic Stone/Cyborg the clear standout. Ultimately, Zack Snyder's Justice League is just that. Zack Snyders. Its unabashedly a direct sequel to the Ultimate Cut of his Batman v Superman and makes absolutely no compromises in moving that story, or its characters, forward in new and expansive ways. Of course, no film is perfect. I have minor gripes with Snyder's usage of Superman as a super-weapon rather than a image of hope, and his fetishising of the doom-scape \"knightmare timeline\" feels less important here than when first introduced as a potential outcome of the narrative Snyder was setting up; however the latter I can forgive as I am sure there is more context to be discovered in future films. I am very interested to see where this universe moves to from here, whether it can exist as its own elseworld \"Snyderverse\" cinematic universe or not. James Wan's Aquaman certainly doesn't line up with this version, nor does Wonder Woman 84 or (I suspect) the upcoming FLASH film. And maybe it doesn't need to. Warner Brothers studios has been quite upfront about launching the DC multiverse, so who knows?

Built every character up perfectly without rushing or overselling. The story went along at a great pace. I'm not sure it could've gotten any better.

I prefer the way the 2017 release ended. I didn't like that all the heroes were in agreement about resurrecting Superman. The Icelandic singing was way too long.Worst of all, there was entirely TOO MUCH CYBORG!!! It felt like this was a Cyborg movie and the rest of cast were simply tertiary characters. I feels like Snyder was appeasing that guy after all his social media whining he's been doing.Finally, I found NO usefulness to the alternate reality scenes.By all means, have a watch. It's worth it.

The VFX and musical score were par for the course from Snyder, absolutely great for both. The tone feels much lighter than Snyder's other movies, the humor and team dynamics help with that a lot despite a darker story.

This version of Justice League is far superior to the previous version of the Justice League film. However, just because it is better does not mean it's perfect. In an attempt not to write a ridiculously long review for this 4 hour film I will be using point form in order to write down everything this film does right, and everything this film does wrong.Positives:\n+ Ben Affleck & Henry Cavill still give really solid performances.+ Wonder Woman is done perfectly with the except of a few lines.+ The inclusions of the Greek Pantheon, the Green Lanterns, and the Martian Man-hunter were all fantastic.+ Darkseid is pretty good for what he's supposed to be.+ Deathstroke was perfect.+ Cyborg is written fairly well.+ The scene where the Flash time travels.Negatives:\nZack Snyder as a film maker seems to really hate colour, which I think is a disservice to a lot of these characters with the exception of batman.All Scenes underwater are too dimly lit.The Flash is really obnoxious until the final act of the film.This film could've easily been 3 hours long and you wouldn't need to remove anything meaningful. Just take out the unnecessary slow motion and singing.Personally I didn't like Cyborg design in comparison to past designs.Lois Lane just don't work in these films.Zack Snyder doesn't understand superman.Jessie Eisenberg is a terrible Lex Luthor.Steppenwolf is a very boring villian.I don't think the anti-life equation was adequately explained.The Flash touching Iris's face during her car accident was super creepy (plus weiner jokes)Jared Leto is still a really bad Joker.Wonder Woman theme overusedThis movie is held back by plotlines started in terrible films (batman v superman, man of steel).", "Please restore snyderverse": "This version connects us to victor stone aka cyborg.One of the mustwatch for a superhero movie enthusiast.Awaiting for future parts.Please restore snyderverse.", "Just Wowwwww": "If Anybody need To Say Something you need to say it to Dc Fans cuz they Are the Raisons why We see This Masterpiece . from 2019 they Start the Campaign And Now we see The Result", "bdsfac": "Movie is awesome..but i prefer watch is some more superman.. minutes not bore..dont worry your eyes to 3 hours because superman is coming and save to world", "Barely decent": "The previous movie must have sucked so hard for this to have an 8.4 average.

Some continuity issues (Mera having a British accent & wrong shading for her hair, kept the air bubbles for underwater dialog, Atlantians being able to breath air without having to be highborn & William Dafoe having long hair) however this film was to be released PRIOR to any standalone film - so I can look past the issues.This was suppose to be the real starting point of the DCEU & I feel like it would have been perfect.

Too bad there are articles out there with information mentioning what the sequels would have been like.", "An Epic Masterpiece (that needs to be canon)": "This was a masterpiece. Zack Snyder's vision finally achieved, and it's not only his finest work, but it is the best Superhero movie ever made.Zack tells a beautiful story that brings you into this world he has created.

In general the movie palet is much brighter than the theatrical release and it's actually a litte better with the humor.This has to be made cannon to the DCEU!

Though the movie is 4 hr long, it is so amazing and jaw dropping that I wanted to see more. Being a flash fan I am truly amazed seeing how they developed and portrayed the character in the film. Even they did a great work with Cyborg. Overall, The SnyderCut is remarkable JackSnyder's masterpiece and one of the best comic book movie till date from DC.For the people who are criticizing about aspect ratio, when a film is converted to 16:9 ratio,the scene had to be trimmed or stretched. Films are normally shot in 4:3 aspect ratio then converted to 16:9 for screening. Snyder did this to keep the scenes intact.", "Totally Deserving": "Can't believe WB were holding this masterpiece for so long. It must be the DCEU canon instead of the whedon cut ... the base is pretty strong that can continue more of awesome storylines. Therefore WB shall #restorethesnyderverse his vision is totally lovable", "Overhyped, tedious and bloated": "I don't understand what the hype about this movie is. I get that it was long awaited, I'll agree it's an improvement over Whedon's work but it's still a pretty bang average movie. Movie goes too deep into character building. I agree it's necessary to have that but it should have been done in solo movies instead of overstuffing one that's meant to be about their team up. Firstly, it could've been done was to give each character a solo movie and have batman show up in the post credits trying to recruit them.Secondly, I can't get over the whole messiah symbolism around these heroes. What with all the slo mo shots with the heroes towering above like gods or people singing about them in the background. I think that's just a Snyder thing though. The man can't resist putting symbolism in his movies.All in all, this movie should have been half the length it is, and should not take itself too seriously. It can be done, like The Dark Knight trilogy, but that's quite difficult to pull off and Snyder is not up to the task.", "Erase 2017 Justice League from your memory": "I wish there was a way to erase the previous version from my mind (and everyone else's) because it's hard not to judge this movie without a comparison. One of the problems with that is that some people think that this is a reboot or extended cut of the prior, and it's not. Another problem is that people seem to think that if Joss Whedon hadn't taken over Zack Snyder's project that this is the movie we would've got in theatres originally; it isn't. This is what would've most likely been the director's cut, whereas the theatrical release would've cut about an hour cut from this version, but it is Zack's true vision in all of it's deserved glory. One of the many benefits of releasing a movie on a streaming platform..So, I will try not to make comparisons to the 2017 version. The only thing I will say in reference to it is that Joss' version does have about an hour or so's worth of Zack's film. The rest of his movie was reshoots and rewrites.The Justice League is created from Batman's desire to build a team of metahumans to take on monumental threats and, just like BvS was to Man of Steel, takes off right out of the ashes of the previous film. Right away you are struck with tone of the film, and it is laid on THICK.He recruits Cyborg, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Flash and together they pit themselves against one of Darkseid's former generals, Steppenwolf, who has been banished from planet Apokolips, and is charged to collect the 3 Motherboxes to form the Unity which will bring about the end and Darkseid's return to Earth, the first of which resides in Themyscira, which was awakened by Superman's death wails.Each time a Box is found, Steppenwolf acquires it. During which time all of our heroes are introduced and this takes up most of the movie. Zack does a wonderful job getting you to care about and understand all of the members of the League as individuals, so it actually matters when they finally team up.Having failed in a confrontation with Steppenwolf, the team decides to bring Supes back to life. Afterwards, the Justice League defeats Steppenwolf as a collective, but all showing their individual strengths and not just letting Superman do all of the work. I'm trying to be spoiler free here, so I do apologize if this seems vague.To me this always felt like a Superman arc. It started with Superman's rise in Man of Steel, we saw his fall in Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (and please, watch the Ultimate Edition; do yourself a favor), and saw him be born again in Justice League, and I think this trilogy does a great job at not blurring the characters and overwhelming you too many too soon, hence the 4-hour blockade. It's a bit of a marathon, but it doesn't feel like 4 hours; you're not pummeled with overaction or boring, necessary plot. It all feels cohesive and by the time the last film ends, you're wanting more.Especially with the Epilogue.Fans of the comics may get more out of that section of the film than average moviegoers , but the importance of that nightmare is foreboding. And to leave you wanting more! So try not to read too much into it..I really enjoyed this movie, and I think, if you're able to erase 2017's film from your memory, you might just enjoy it as well. So make no plans for the night, order in, take your phone off the ringer and nuke some popcorn; you're in for a treat.", "The journey usually matters more than the finish line. This time both were great.": "After I finished watching the movie for the 2nd time I said the same thing as the first. I want more and I loved the journey. Yes the main plot is the same more or less as the 2017 theatrical version but the journey to get to the end could not be any more different. Not to mention the actual ending is different and vastly superior. This time around we get much more character development, we get higher stakes and an actual menacing villain. They did elude to a much bigger threat looming but that did not take away from Steppenwolf's character and role in the film. Steppenwolf ranks up there with some of the best villains to date in design and character. The way his armor is constantly moving and shifting as if it was a sentient all on its own doing whatever it needs to in order to ensure the protecting of its wearer was really spectacular. The level of detail in it alone was great. As a huge Superman fan I would have loved to see more but I was perfectly fine letting the new break out stars like Cyborg get some spotlight. I loved Bruce's continuous transition to be a better person and actually follow through with is promise from BVS. There is too much to write and I would love to keep going so all I am going to say is that if I could sit and watch this on my regular LCD TV twice before watching it on my $10K home theater system I cannot wait for this weekend where I can sit down and watch it as if I was in the theater in all its glory as Zack intended for me to do.For anyone who thinks it may be too long, they broke it down in parts so you can stop at any part and pick up where you left off perfectly fine.", "Some negative reviewers are just downright MFs.": "This is the best Superhero movie so far... This goes to show how important editing is. Bad editing can literally ruin a movie or turn it into a master piece that this movie is. What I don't get is that some MFs still bash this movie.

Tom Holkenborgs score is absolutely incredible and adds so much weight to every scene. The majority of the shots in this film feel as if they're wripped straight out of a graphic novel. This movie set out to tell an epic tale surrounding the most popular of the DC character catelog and it succeeds ten fold! Bravo!", "NEED MORE": "I wasn't expecting it would be this good as it was.

The expectation was over the roofs.\nWell guess what, Zack Snyder set his bar ABOVE said roof. He Nailed it to the ground and made his permanent mark. This movie is all i expected and much more. It took me on a 4 Hour long journey and made me want more. VERY rarely does that happen to me. It made me soo Happy on various different levels.\n2 Hour of Slow, Detailed, Emotional and Striking Character Development + 2 Hours of Epic, over the top and Fantastic Action with justice Served.THIS IS WHAT THE DC IS. OR WHAT DC SHOULD BE. OR DC MUST BE.", "I want #RestoreTheSnyderVerse": "The zack snyder justice league is just amazing and i want to watch its sequel.

Nothing new just a couple of back stories and Steppenwolf has a new and better armour! Actually I would have rated it at least a 5 but seeing how other people are overrating it, I am going to rate it 1! The Avengers was, is , and will be the best first team up superhero movie ever!! This one doesn't even compare!", "Hikaye kurgusu..": "The emotional state of the characters is very well explained. All the necessary story pieces are given like a puzzle. The film has an immersive structure that will keep its integrity from the beginning to the end and will not go away. There is no trace of the old one and a masterpiece has emerged.", "I'm more of a marvel fan, BUT....": "When watching this movie i compare it to Avengers end game, which I liked. But while watching end game it were parts of the film I was like \" man when will this movie end.\" I must say during the Zack S. justice league the thought never crossed my mind. It was entertaining the whole 4hrs. If your skeptical trust me it is worth it. I hope Warner Bros green lights a justice league 2. Also the redesign of steppenwolf very much needed. I could watch this movie multiple times .", "Fresh review from a lucky guy that didn't see the first one": "I just saw Snyder's Cut and I'm so impressed! It's been years since a movie delivered such a well-put story and execution!\nI was disappointed with Batman v Superman, so I skipped the first Justice League. And now I wanted to see what all the hype was about.\nI wanted to be introduced to all the \"new\" characters, and this movie delivers! I really liked them and I'm left wanting for more story!\nI wish this would start a new Snyderverse of movies!", "From the worst DC movie to the Best!!": "Four hours of your life can't be spent any better than watching Zack Snyder's Justice League. Was very skeptical now I'm more than delighted. Felt it was an complete move, not the rushed job of the first release. Watch and enjoy. Thanks Zack!!", "Snyder goes closer to 300": "Wheldon did well with the song mourning Superman and with WW's facial makeup. Other than that, Snyder's version is just better with its visually and graphically darker tone. \"Believe it\" sounds much better than \"a believer.\" The actual Wonder Woman leaves both 1984's and Wheldon's diplomatic JL versions in the past.", "Snyderverse is superior.": "Already one of the best CBM of all time. The flow of the movie was smooth. Amazing CGI work as usual from Zack Snyder VFX team. Dividing the movie into 7 chapters is really a good move. One of the biggest takeaway from this movie is Cyborg and The Flash character arcs. I care for them now. Steppenwolf was a massive upgrade from JL 2017. Zack Snyder's Trilogy will be the blue print for upcoming all CBM. The conversations are going to be amazing. Need a sequel now", "A modern day tale of gods , monsters and men": "This film is a truimph in what fans can do to influence media and get what they want. Zack Snyder's justice league is a whole different film to joss whedon's theatrical cut it is gritty and darker but not as dark as past dceu films. With the film only having wonder woman and superman rly fleshed out when the film came out. This film has to setup and develop the characters and it does so over a 4 hour runtime which gives it enough time to do everything it had to do and then some. steppennwolf has a motivation , cyborg is a damaged person who symbolises the whole team but this is done without a tattoo on his head. flash gives the film some fun tones and ezra millers performance is great dispite the dialogue not being the best. The action is brilliant all the way through and this is due to some excellent cinematography but the OVERUSED slow mo gets annoying and its makes it feel like the film keeps halting dont get me wrong its badass in some scenes but the overuse of it removed the effect when its the 20th time its being used. Darkseid is such a cool menacing addition and his inclusion just makes me want to beg for Snyder's vision to be rrealized.The knightmare scene, martian manhunter, deathstroke and Lex are all the seeds that Snyder planted for his sequels and the fans want them now more than ever. This film has shown us the potential of dc and there universe , how there more then just popcorn filck's with some laughs and a final battle it works for marvel but dc is different and we need to see the Synder verse restored.", "Zack saved the DC world": "4hours went woosh watching this a spectacle of a movie\nI read DC comics in my childhood and boy I was actually grinning while watching this.\nI hope Zack Snyder is given the ballot to make the next part as this was the finest superhero movie I've ever seen.", "Snyder JL is a knock out": "The original idea Zack had was the RIGHT direction. (Applause to the Snyders)\nEverything you wanna see in your favorite comic books, now in real life non-stop action with a MUCH MUCH better ending. Do make sure to really pay much attention to the ending it will leave you with your jaws open...\nNow that the people have spoken and got to see both sides of the story, it's very clear the people want The SnyderVerse to continue the DCEU. UNITED WE STAND", "Dude, I think I just filled the cup!": "Wonderfully paced and gave enough time to each character to allow the audience to care for them. I sincerely hope this incarnation of the JL is allowed to develop. Thoroughly enjoyable and a rarity that lived up to the gargantuan hype.", "It would be the best and wiser move to get Snyder on board again": "I was one of those who lost their faith in Snyderverse after that horrrible deadend of 2017 with that JL that was a real desapointment. I felt so tired after seeing it at the time, that the 2 hours and minutes that last, seemed to be a century long. Of course, it is all the personal and tragic matters on the bottom of all that production and postproduction polemic. But watching this new dimension..., with this Snyder's Cut of the film... WOW!... I think is very possible a rebirth... I think is possible that, with Snyder on the head, Warner and DC may become the new phenomena on the superheroes world, putting the DC universe on a all new level, making look the 'Marvelverse' like a childplay. It is possible... they only have to make a jump of faith... I believe in Zack.", "Absolute best of the best!!": "This movie was everything.

Thanks to all fans, Zack, Warner Bros and all people who have been supporting and making this movie. It's finally been existed!. This movie is an actual masterpiece. The 4 hours is packed with details and surprises that you haven't seen from Joss's. Seeing the characters that I adore, Wonder Woman, drives me so crazy. Speaking of fight scenes, Zack doesn't disappoint us again. All fight scenes are great and beautiful. If Warner Bros decided to show Zack's version and let him finish what he's been doing I think this movie will be one of the world's greatest movies.", "A saga the likes of which have never been seen before": "ZSJL is one of the most expressive superhero films in the history of film making. It has everything that makes a film good. If you haven't watched it yet and are worried about the four-hour stamp, you should not worry. The movie passes by like a breeze. The pacing is such that you will never feel like it is \"slow\". It gently and carefully explores the story, making sure that there are no loose threads hanging in the end, no inexplicable scenes. The audience will walk away elated and hopeful, without confusion and surprisingly entertained. Even after all that, it clearly leaves a door wide open for the franchise to grow into a saga.\nWhile it might be a stretch to say it is a COMPLETELY new film when compared to the 2017 version, it is true that all the flaws of that film have been extracted and replaced with cinematic, meaningful and fascinating storytelling.\nAny fan of DC should give it a shot. It does all six members of the JL justice in a way I have never seen done in any other superhero team-up film. This film flaunts the potential DC characters have, their powers, their heart and struggles, and their humanity. Hope this opens new doors for the DCEU because these characters should be given the space to grow and evolve.", "Please sir, can I have some more?": "Okay, no spoilers here, but I really enjoyed this movie! Yes it's long, yes there are some segments (the singing as Aquaman swims off?) that made me scratch my head, but it's a great movie.\nI feel that this version almost tells a different story (a bit like the directors cut of the Abyss/Aliens special edition) with far more characterisation and empathy for our heroes.\nThe epilogue section has really left me wanting more, as long as the 'more' has a compelling story, solid performances from the characters and no meddling by the studio.", "Worst movie": "It's look like b grade movie. I Don't know why people love this", "A major improvement on the Whedon cut": "Aside from Wonder Woman, I did not like any of the Dc universe movies, with each one repeating the same mistakes as the last and wasting potential. However, the Snyder cut has know made me want to see where they go next with characters that I scarcely knew the names of from previous films. It even redeemed Jared Leto's joker, truly making his character into something sinister.", "As grand as it gets!": "This movie is GRAND. It has been worth the wait, and worth the massive fan campaign. It's extraordinary in multiple ways. An amazing journey- you cry, smile and find yourself tearing up with hope. You care for each character. Snyder knows how to craft magic, and this is as magical as it gets.", "We need the SnyderVerse": "DC characters have always been much more interesting when the synopsis is dark and gritty. Zack Snyder understands DC.", "It's finally here and I am glad it lives up to the hype. Thank you Zack": "Everything about this movie is good. Separating it in chapters makes it easier for home viewing . Sad that it didn't release in theatres, it would have looked great in IMAX.", "good for dc to #RestoreTheSnyderverse": "Best comic film ever than marvel or whatever! I love this so much", "Excellent closing of a Trilogy!": "What can we say about a photography master loke Zack Snyder is, just by naming some of his films (300, Watchman, Dawn of the Dead, etc) comes to our mind, SPARTA screaming, blood, darkness, magic, heavens and colors that explode in one's retina.\nThe plot arc finally closed as it should, starting with Man of Stell, BVS. @warnerbros Warner bros, DC would have to be a kick to create spins off and even, a wonderful sequel, in Atlantis, in Apokalips or wherever you want, giving rise to thousands of iconic DC characters.", "Wonderful movie. Epic!": "I like the storytelling of the movie. It had many complementary pieces but always point at the ommon end. The pace is perfect. All the haracter's are fully developed. The tone of the movie is perfect because it has comic moments at the precise moments. Nothing is forced.", "Great movie, that tells the full story": "I was lost in the theatrical version, it made very little sense. Yes, this version is long (and I could have done with 50% less slow motion), but it makes sense. Snyder explains why the characters are doing what they are about to do. It made it MUCH more coherent. I also love the beautifully shot, bombastic, action scenes, they felt much more epic than the old version.", "The Snyderverse is indeed needed now.": "This movie does complete justice to each and every character of the case. we can see the stories of every new character.\nAfter waiting 4 years this movie is worth it. Snyder made everything in so much detail. The new wonder woman BGM is so nice to hear.\nNow we need Snyderverse so badly.", "Snyder creates magic": "I was one of the few who enjoyed the Whedon version but now I have seen the Snyder cut I am in awe and can see the flaws from the Whedon version. The story was amazing the character arcs were perfect and the fight scenes blew me away. Every part drew me in more and more and the ending has left me screaming for a sequel. Snyders vision of the Justice League is cinematic perfection.", "Best DC film since Nolan's Bat Trilogy": "Finally a DC film that I would want to watch again, even at 4 hours long! Restoring Cyborg as the central character is 'justice'. It ruins the continuity that the Whedon has created but don't be concerned with that. Hopefully DC will see sense and follow this as the definitive film to move the DCEU forward but they won't. The awful Whedon version is now a distant memory.", "No bad but could've been better": "I'll start with the bad things first.The aspect ratio is just awful, just fill the screen and make a second version in 4:3, you know the black&white version.It's 4 freaking hours which is just too long.It has too many moments were nothing happens, and/or boring \"why does it need this\" events.Now the good parts\nIf you skip the boring parts it's actually not a bad movie.", "Wow, what a relief": "I'm am a huge DC fan so I have to admit I was biased when justice league 2017 came out, I told myself I really enjoyed it ( which I did ) I knew deep down it had its flaws, alot of them but it was still an okay movie, but this just frustrates me that they didn't put 2017 justice league on pause and wait for snyder to have his much needed time off and come back to this because my god it was absolutely incredible, Steppenwolf and all the main cast were so fleshed out and it just made total sense with no confusion. After watching I also thing Jared Leto deserves another shot as Joker cuz he was the Joker we deserved and not the rendition of him in suicide squad. All in all its a great movie and I hope they continue the snyderverse", "Better than old one": "Its a good movie. I don't know why some people judging it with avengers.\nIts a DC movie so if you wanna compare then do it with dc films. Personally, I liked it.\nPros: good explanation than old one, good action\nCons: 4 hour movie, so many slow motions scene and extra scenes", "A waste of your time": "Don't be fooled by the hype fan boys are creating. It's still a very bad and boring movie with awful cgi and dialogues. Even the action scenes (which snyder is a master at) are bad\nProbably better than the 2017 version (haven't watched that one) but it's still pretty bad. And this is coming from someone who enjoyed BvS and MoS", "Best 4hrs": "If you think 4hrs is a long movie, after watching this you'll feel that you need more of it.", "Delicious!!": "As I was watching, all I could think is \"I don't want this to end\".\nWhatever it was that we watched before this, would probably be what cake would taste like with no sugar.", "zack Snyder's justice league=4 part of avenger": "Loved the movie, superb action sequences, no rush story of every hero is awesome. Perfect BGM.", "Mediocre.": "I had hopes that the Zack Snyder cut would fix the issues that haunted the first \"attempt\" at the movie. But I find myself noticing the issues in pacing and structuring of scenes and the general balance the movie is lacking.\nWith close to 4 hours of run-time, it is heartbreakingly slow, with a a sore character development arc for each character that feels terrible shoe-horned in.It grasps a very large canvas but delivers very thin lines across everything. It is hard not to compare it to the MCU when it comes to structuring of the cinematic universe, in which case this cinematic universe stumbles on it's own feet in an attempt to create a some-what believable cast of heroes to battle a big villain. It is a lot of information that is required to be thrown at the viewer's in what could have been spread out over a couple of more movies to make the depth, the lore and the pacing much better.And just as with the 2017 version of the same movie, no matter how much of a threat the villain seems to be against the assembled team of heroes, it only takes Superman to arrive to stop him, which destroys the near 3 hour of build up in one swift moment when he finally arrives,The movie offers some level of enjoyment, but not nearly the amount of hype the build up has lead to. It's an Ok popcorn movie, albeit far to monotonous due to it's slow build up due to it's 4 hour run-time. Had they paced the cinematic universe enough to build more characters from the ground up in their own movies, this could have been more enjoyable.Final score: 5/10.", "Absolute": "PERFECTION, nothing more, nothing less, it is exactly what we always wanted and deserved.", "It's a Good Movie but that's it. Just Good": "With all the hype around this movie, it's too much. I think for a fan boy they will definitely love it. Its better than the 2017 version but a lot of scenes that run pretty slow and boring in this movie. It's just movie with good action scene but a bit poor in story. The villain doesn't look that strong as an evil character. And again Superman is too superpower and make his enemy like nothing. I don't think it's gonna be successful if they released it on 2017, imagine 4 hour movie in a theater for not a fan boy, it's too long with a lot of unimportant scenes. Don't get me wrong, overall it's a good movie, but not great.", "Comic Age has been reborn": "Insane! Very well crafted! Love is present in all movie scenes\nF#ck Joss Whedon & WB, you're trash!", "Worth a watch. Simply": "This movie is amazing. At first I was a little bit sceptical due to the length. I was afraid it would drag a lot, building up the exitement only to finish in a bad way, but I was wrong. This is what I've been missing in every superhero movie since the legendary Batman trilogy.Snyder truly knows what he is doing, the darker theme, makes it perfect. I won't spoil anything, as this movie is a Joy to watch", "Amazing...": "Movie is great..much better that Josh Wedon's (who I like) 'marvelized' version.Only shortcoming is Epilogue but only beacuse its for comic book fans only.", "'Zack Snyder's Justice League' Review": "I didn't see the original Justice League. This is because the reviews are pretty bad for this film. However, I was excited to see the Synder cut as I did like Man of Steel and the ultimate edition of Batman V Superman. I'm glad that the Synder cut got released as I like it a lot.Even though I never see the original Justice League, I did see a few scenes of it. Based on the few scenes that I've watched, the Synder cut is so much better in many ways: action, acting, characters, story, visuals, etc. It is baffling why the studio wants to go with the Whedon version instead of this.However, there are many problems with this movie. My main issue is that there are many plot holes in this movie. There are also many scenes that I feel could be trim down or cut out. This movie is 4h long and it doesn't need to be. I also do not like the 4:3 aspect ratio. That aspect ratio works if it is an IMAX screen, but it is not suitable for a TV screen.Overall, I do enjoy this movie very much. However, there are many problems with it. Still, I would recommend watching it if you have the time.", "#RestoreTheSnyderVerse PLEASE!!!": "Watching this film was truly an amazing experience! Although, if you're not a fan of Zack Snyder's previous entries in the DCEU, (Man of Steel, Batman v Superman) this one probably won't suit you either. But as a long time fan of Zack Snyder and DC comics I must say this movie was LONG overdue! A heart pumping, jaw-dropping, inspiring, EPIC experience through and through! This is NOT the same movie as the 2017 version of Justice League at all! This is a GREATLY superior film in almost every way imaginable. This is the true realization of an inspired director's original vision and a tribute to the hardcore fans! The run time isn't an issue, it flies by quite smoothly and by the end it leaves you craving much more! #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "This is how to make a comic book movie!": "It gives the same feeling as reading a great comic book. If the aspect ratio is a turn off just crop the screen. A bit of the edges will be cut off when in fullscreen but nothing important will be missed by cropping. Cyborg is the goat and should have got his own movie like aquaman did. Docked a point for leto joker(just awful) and batman f bomb felt unnecessary.", "All thanks to Zack Snyder's cut": "Better than theatrical cut. We hope you could still do the JL2 and finish what you've started. This is a great experience. It really give me goosebumps.", "The Original is here and it's EPIC": "This is what DC needs more of.\n#ContinueTheSnyderVerse\n#RestoreTheSnyderverse\n#Batfleck\n#RayFisherIsOurCyborg.Make the JL2 and JL3. Finish the Whole Vision.\nWhile this is happening every DC Fan will support the other Dc Movies that comes out.Thanks too all the Fans\nand the Beloved Snyder Family", "This is what we're waiting for..": "Zack thank you so much for your efforts towards this film... hats off to u... looking more from u... yeah we deserve more from u...", "The epic which has been granted by the Gods finally": "Ever doubted the capabilities of a director like Snyder? This movie is going to be a slap on many such critics and production houses cough \"WB\" cough. After a half baked BVS (the director cut was far better than the actual one) I just couldn't help feeling sorry for my favourite superheroes. The DC has been the face of comic book world. The popularity of characters like Superman ,Batman are unparalleled across the world. It's a shame when we get such underwhelming versions of our ICONIC characters. This movie is in fact a pefect tribute to our heroes. Coming to the movie I can still remember people displaying their so called \"skepticism\" when Snyder cut's release was announced. At last what did we get?? A complete universe builder which had so much potential if it was released back then in 2017 DCEU would've been in much better space now. The plot is so well constructed you can wonder what would've been the thought process when it was scrapped for the garbage that we got in 2017. Each and every character has it's moments throughout the movie. The emotional arch was spot on. Time and again Snyder has gone through such a rough patch in his life I wish this movie is gonna make him feel much better now. Steppenwolf was menacing I thought I would never ever say this but he is. Inclusion of Darkseid and the idea of building a much bigger and better universe was commendable. The way I see it this is \"The best DCEU movie\" I witnessed till date. It is a must watch if you are a DC fan. Now that the movie is out I feel so terrible that I won't be able to see the original vision Zack had for DCEU. I hope not The original trilogy is good as dead. But there is a ray of hope I guess. All that WB has to do is just have some sense now and restore Snyder trilogy. I wish this could happen.", "One of the top comic book movies of all time": "This movie is such a unique experience. It feels more comic book like than anything else I have ever seen. I am so glad that this is available to the public. Excellent action and, while long, the characters and story feel really well realized. This movie is epic. I hope we get more in this timeline.", "Best superhero movie yet": "Haters, posers, and MCU fanatics put lots of efforts to give this movie bad reviews and bad ratings.. as a Marvel and DC fan, I gave this amazing movie an easy10/10", "Absolutely THE best Superheroes movie!": "Well, compares to Josstice League, absolutely better story telling, characters writing, better color grading, better CGI, better plots, better villains, better EVERYTHING! It would be insane for WB not to #RestoreTheSnyderverse. Thanks Zack Snyder, WB and the fans for making this wonderful movie happened! God bless.", "Snyder back in the game........": "Dc need to be dark...... although movie is not like 2017 justice league so every second of it is amazing (for dc lover's).", "It's what the fans needed.": "Just everything the original Justice league lacked was improved in spades. 4 hours well spent. Thank you Zack!", "#Restoredthesnyderverse": "Thats movie is Really Good, better than Joss Whedon versi\u00f3n. Ben affleck like Batman and Henry like Superman is one of the most importan on this day...", "What a Masterpiece!!": "I watched Justice League 2017 and that movie was basically garbage\nZack Snyder's Justice League is a whole different movie than the previous iteration. Every character's backstory and some light balanced punchline made me feel like watching a marvel movie.\nTo be honest it was better than age of ultron.\nHallelujah!!", "Thank you Zack!!!": "This movie changed the super hero genre. I have no idea what Warner Brothers was thinking when they decided to screw this up.\nHighly recommend watching this movie. My eyes were wide open for 4 hours!!!For Autumn!!", "This is the Best Comic Movie Ever!": "This is what I was hoping for in 2017. When I saw the original Justice League I was like OMG They failed but after watching this I realize it was Warner Brothers who failed by interfering with the Director and Zach Snyder would have saved DC had they released this version originally.", "OUT OF ANY FRANCHISE'S LEAGUE !": "A beautiful, masterful, brutal masterpiece of filmmaking ! ... Marvel does not and will never have the balls to make such a movie ! .....", "Epic, Grand and full of heart (Spoiler-free)": "\"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\" - Paulo CoelhoWhen the movie ended and the words 'For Autumn' appeared on the screen, I guess most Snyder fans would've broken into tears along-with a sense of inner peace. Because for us who gathered behind a hashtag to support Zack, this is more than a movie. It's an emotion. The feeling of being united, part of something and seeing what you fought for come to fruition. The fulfillment of it.Man of Steel is where I was introduced to Zack Snyder. It had an impact on me unlike any other CBM back then. I was deeply invested in the story he was telling, cared so much for the characters especially because of the way he conveys so much through visuals alone backed with great lines from his writers. It was heart-breaking how the studio and co. wronged Snyder in 2017. 3 years and one of the biggest fan campaigns ever later, here we are witnessing a great CBM in all its glory. A movie that is epic in every possible way rich with stunning visuals, great background score and mind-blowing action sequences.It is very evident that Zack has a lot of respect and care for these characters and treats them godlike. Each member of the league gets their moments to shine.Cyborg's backstory, his relationship with his father and his whole arc was really touching. He is indeed the heart of Justice League.That jaw-dropping Flash moment was just out of this world. Ezra Miller was fantastic as the fastest man alive.Glad to see Wonder Woman portrayed as the ferocious warrior she is. Aquaman was badass as usual. Batman being the one to unite the league, lead them and seeds are sown hinting at his larger role in the knightmare timeline. Even with a limited screen time, Superman just knocks it out of the park. He was simply unleashed during the final fight.The character interactions among the JL members was interesting to watch - How they came together and supported each other.Steppenwolf here is a villain with a motive unlike his 2017 counterpart. The new steppenwolf design is both stylish and scary. Talk about Darkseid- Ray Porter is a beast. A perfect choice.The 4:3 aspect ratio and dividing the movie into chapters with an epilogue gave me the feel of reading through a graphic novel, panel by panel. 90% of the CGI is top-notch. Gotta appreciate Junkie XL for putting out a 4-hour score that elevates the movie to another level - sans the repeated WW chant that I felt was misplaced at some scenes - and Fabian Wagner for the excellent cinematography. Most of the dialogues by Chris Terrio were just fire.It's great to finally have a closure to this movement or a continuity if the Snyderverse will be restored, only time will tell. Love it or hate it, but we now live in a society where there is a 4 hour long live action Justice League Movie.Also, isn't it ironic that Jor-El's quote from MOS, \"You will give the people of earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. You'll help them accomplish wonders !\", fits very well for Zack's journey from Man of Steel to Snydercut. This is his big victory. A passionate filmmaker getting to show the world his uncompromised work of art with least studio interference.", "Wow just wow #snydercut #justiceisserved": "10/10 movie experience at home best way to end the snyder trilogy. Fan service at its best.", "This movie feels complete now": "It's definitely way better than the 2017 version mess we witnessed. It's consistent and feels whole.\nI like that in every frame you feel the attention to details by Zack and his team.\nThe characters and story have enough time to build. I also like their idea to make Cyborg subplot one of the central elements since most of the other characters have their own movies. It's not only interesting, but also unites the parts of the story together very well.\nThe movie is Snyder at his finest with all the slow motion shots, heroic stands and oneliners. There were like 10 times when they were close to overdo it and make it cringe, but they always knew where to stop. Little comedic touches and lines were also very nice and on point.\nSo overall it's very enjoyable experience.", "Better than the theatrical, BY FAR.": "Wow! You mean at one point the plot actually made SENSE?! What was Joss thinking? Oh, that's right, he was only thinking of himself. And the amount of Cyborg's story that was scrapped from the movie is downright criminal. No wonder Ray is mad. I'd be mad too. And his claims are now clearer to me than ever before. I totally believe him. ONLY complaint I have are a few of the moments that were cleverly for fan service that I don't think should've been included. But, if it weren't for the fans, this wouldn't have happened so maybe that was Zack's \"thank you\". I also still don't think the WW bank heist scene is necessary. Doesn't tie in with anything at all. But I did like the new version of it.", "BREATH TAKING!!!": "You cant even compare to the previous theatrical release because that itself would be a disrespect to snyder cut. Start to finish everything is well balanced and perfectly made. Every scene is magic for comic and animated series fans. 10/10. Worth 4 hours and waiting 3 years for it.", "Finally The Real Justice League": "Finally, I was able to watch the Justice League movie that I had been waiting for for a long time. After Man of Steel and BvS movies, you can understand the universe Zack Snyder wants to transfer. The good sides of the movie are that he told the characters as much as possible in 4 hours, and even if the music was not at the level of Hans Zimmer, it is now a better, more serious superhero movie. The downsides of the movie are bad CGI in some places, the recurring Wonder Woman theme. Anyway the movie satisfied me so my score is 8/10.", "Absolutely mind blowing!": "Simply amazing and definitely worth the wait. For whatever reason WB does not consider this canon to the DCEU is just strange and absurd. Way too huge of a cliffhanger to just leave the planned sequels from Zack Snyder to simply let go.\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "To be experienced.": "A movie which is a surprise and deserving to be watched.", "THE BEGINNING": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack went back to DC routes with the content he ripped straight from comic books and inserted it in this film which is the best thing a film director that's working on a DC project could ever do. I realized a couple of DC directors hasn't done that in a while with the new DC movies that's come out. I really consider Warner Bros rethinking their decisions and restore the Snyderverse.", "Nothing short from how it could've been": "Keeps you deeply invested for 4 hours, even when you know the plot already... all the deserved building the characters, and the intensity of situations which were missing in 2017.Im glad this happened, and im glad this version exists as a reference to look at DC movies going forward.", "Kind of meh Characters": "The movie is really long but it doesn't feel like it tells its story. It never manages to get me engaged with the characters like Cyborg has great potential for an internal conflict but it never feels like it really happens. He doesn't have a break down over the fact that he has lost everything but his dad, and in the end when he meets the unity it feels like he just wins without any doubt or anything really. He barely even hesitates.I never feel like anything is at stake with the characters except for Barry since we get to see him clearly in pain and stressed. The rest never really interact with their environment, or even comment on it.The dialogues also feel bad.", "A much superior version to the original": "I never usually write reviews but as I've watched this I thought I would give it a go. I saw the original cinematic version in 2017 and now this whilst in lockdown in the UK. This version is far superior with added emotional depth and a completely different tone to the original. The story line actually makes sense now and the villains actually have a sense of evil and menace. Although 4 hours long I broke it into chunks to watch and found my self watching larger and large parts as I got more into it as I wanted to see what happened next. If you've got the time watch this movie ...you won't be disappointed. As everyone has said this is the movie they should have originally released. (maybe a tad shorter)", "Absolutely terrible": "It's campy, it's ridiculous, it's full of music at the worst places, the scenario makes no sense at all, it's absolutely terrible and looks like it was directed by a 14 year old.

Something I have missed: John and green lanterns are also a treat to us thanks zack waiting for your next movie. #wewantsnyderverse", "BEST SUPERHERO FILM FROM DCEU!!!!!": "If you really want to compare this movie with marvel avengers let me clarify you that this movie has got enough issues with theatre release. Some characters in that film was supposed to have no importance. But in this version every character has their own importance and every character has plot story which is not shown or scrapped before. 4hrs seems short if you are a fan of DC comics, The way this movie was presented makes you feel happy. Aspect ratio as people complained didn't really bothered me as it was negligible, You can see the movie pretty well. And people who started to complain, have a research on this project to know better. Comparing with marvel doesn't make this movie bad. It has pros and cons but it was presented as the part of fans request and mostly those cons are forgettable. Finally if you hate the movie in terms of comparison and duration along with aspect ratio, Find some better excuses to say the movie is bad. #restorethesnyderverse", "All Hail The King!": "I subscribed HBO Go just to watch this film.

It'd be better than Batman vs Superman. But after five years of promises, fan-demands, outcry, hashtags on and on and on, I expected more. But this just sits you down in front of the most hideous visual style ever comitted to film and forces you to squint for an entire afternoon trying to make vague black shapes out among the grey. And it keeps going, on and on, through every boring set piece you've seen in a hundred superhero movies before. Oh, they need to collect the maguffins now, even though Mother Boxes never worked like that in the comics? Oh, the big grey guy is going to punch, I wonder how hard he's going to punch? Oh, it was hard. How shocking.The only thing you can say for Snyder's DCEU is that it stays true to its emotions, where Marvel will always compromise drama with a joke. But the only emotion I had by the end of this was fatigue. I don't want to keep complaining. I don't want to think about this movie any more. I don't want to hear about it, from haters or brainwashed fans who were going to love it anyway. I don't want to see how high the rating goes because the only people who rated it finished watching it, and the only people who could manage that are sadists like me or those same fans. I want it to go away. I want it to leave me alone and in ten years I'll come back for the good Justice League movie, with characters I care about and a story I'm invested in.

Totally different movie. 10/10\nStory, acting, is just perfect really connects up everything.\nPlease continue your work mr. Snyder.", "Complete Slog": "This is 4 plus hours of painfully slow, dreary, and generic superhero film. Outside of the visuals nothing is impressive other than the sheer amount of pointless moments that they poured into this movie. The story and villains are generic, nothing new. The characters feel basic and undeveloped and the acting is, for the most part, nothing to write home about. The film has a ridiculously over the top amount of slow mo and I have never hated it more. Their are too many simply mind boggling choices within the sound track. Finally, it simply isn't interesting enough to fill the amount of time needed and it makes a movie that has absolutely zero rewatch value. A 4 hour movie has to be earned and Snyder did not earn that runtime. Overall a complete slog, took me 8 sittings across 5 days.", "This movie is so epic, you really need to watch it to feel it.": "The movie is a visual treat, if I said just that it will be an oversimplification. The story the charcters , they way you connect to them, the way they make you feel. The background score. It is probabaly the most epic Superhero movie till date, if you rank it jsut as a movie. it comes so close and in someways surpases Endgame.It is an epic movie. Everything about it feels good. The most significant difference between this and the 2017 version.\nEven though it is 4 hours long. I can't wait to re-watch it. YES!! it issss that good.", "Finally it was done right.": "Where do I begin...each character was completely redeemed from the theatrical cut. The story, the action all dialed up to 11.

The WB theatrical release left a bitter taste in our mouth that in as much as our hope in snyder was intact, i just couldn't shake the feeling, this movie might suck. But lo and behold, snyder delivered. This version of the justice league went out of it's way to fill in the blanks the original left us with.

I just wish they would continue with the universe.", "some people are blocked by hype": "Honestly this movie was great but, it is not better than a 9 or 8.5. I'd say its a solid 7.5, medium 8, LIGHT 8.5. The first parts were a bit hard to get through but after it was fine. The first 2 1/2 hours set the movie up nice. I just think that time barrier (4 hours) is just a lot but I understand because it didn't have lets say 22 movies all leading up to this. I would say its a good watch, people should definitely watch the movie. Now on to my opinions, people are honestly blocked by hype it wasnt amazing and some shots i was just thinking \"k.. lets just end this now its getting a lot.\" I honestly liked it though, it allowed a great path for the future of the DC movies. This is surely my opinion but I wished DC movies would expand the universe and space and their villans. (Im going based off movies here) The villan wasn't as developed it was kinda a bit bland. I wish they could expand the villan's development. How the movies incorporate the planets and universe could be better. One more thing to put realistically.. the superheros would save the city but cause destruction but the people still praise them. Realistically the government would try to do something but, if you like movies on superheros and not realistic world involved intergrading plots then this is perfect.

Even then i would warn them not to expect anything special. I just don't see why it's 4 hours long because there's no evidence that the runtime makes it better in any way. All it really does is allow for more mistakes. There's just so many flaws it's hard to cover them all so I'll just stick with what i know best. The dialogue in this movie is just awful. There's a rule you should follow when writing dialogue: show don't tell. I'd say 25 percent of the time when a character speaks it's just to recap what's happened in the story so far. It's almost like they don't trust the audience to have the attention span to watch a 4 hour movie, so they hold our hand through the story beat by beat. If you get past this major flaw then you should be able to get past the rest of them and have an enjoyable viewing experience.", "EXCEEDED HIGH EXPECTATIONS": "Without a doubt, the best DCEU film to date alongside Man of Steel.

The visuals are definitely an improvement compared to the theatrical version and we get to experience a cohesive well-rounded story. The movie even manages to elevate its two prequels (Man of Steel and BvS). Massive congratulations to Zack Snyder.

However, as a flash fan, this version really gave justice to the character. That part in the final act was EVERYTHING. Visually, musically, emotionally, cinematically. It was stunning. It is now my favorite piece of comic book cinema. (Even more than Captain America with Mjolnir) That was a truly heroic act that no one in the DCEU will ever even know and I'm so glad it happened. It rightfully established the Flash as a team member and showed what I love about the character. Also the fact that he vibrated and stuff so the impact of the blast will pass through-brief moment but made me feel like a kid again. Not at all the awful treatment Flash got during 2017! To me, that single scene was what elevated this from an 8.5 to a 10. It was perfect to me. Fans of this cinematic universe were robbed.The movie itself had some questionable choices. A few scenes were done with more slow-motion than I think necessary and it was sliced in a way that was tonally shifting(?) at times. I don't really know how to describe it. It wasn't bad, I just think that it can be overindulgent with those choices. I guess considering this IS *Zack Snyder's* Justice League, I kinda expected it because of his style. In many ways, slow-mo was used beautifully though. Considering also that I barely felt the 4 hours even with all those things, they did a great job.As expected, the cinematography in this is beautiful. I mean beautiful feels like an understatement. So many scenes made me feel like I was flipping through a comic book such as that scene when Commissioner Gordon was waiting for Batman. People can dislike Snyder's style but one thing anybody can probably agree on is his comic book films never look bad.Steppenwolf was cool. He had puppy eyes lol but he was far more menacing compared to the Whedon version. Everything just made sense. Snyder really had a vision for this universe. To really see it come to life breaks my heart that it isn't what I saw at the cinemas and that apparently, this isn't even canon despite being the original story. This version deserved the big screen. The multiverse it set up for deserve to be made.After knowing about Whedon's abusive behavior and blatant racism against some of the cast, I can't help but feel bad overall for the people who worked so hard on Justice League. It makes me happy to see the actual fruition of all the people who poured their heart and hard work into this. Thank you for creating this piece of art.

Plenty of time to flesh out the characters and better understand their motivations. It packs a much harder emotional punch than Whedon's disaster, and even at 4 hours, it never feels tedious. Cyborg and Flash and the main beneficiaries of the extended runtime, but everyone benefits and the world building is on point. My only negative is, if this is truly Snyders last DC film, he has left us with a hole that'll never be filled, due to the build up to a sequel in the last hour. I would more than happily throw money at WB to get 4 more hours of this. Or that Nightmare scene as an Injustice movie.

This movie shows how everything happened from the death of Superman, to the appearance of Steppenwolf, and Darkseid. This is by far the greatest DC movie that has came out!

The Visual Effects are also very great and beautiful. The Music of the film's is also good. And The direction and story telling of Zack Snyder is absolutely brilliant.

And I haven't which the 2017 version of this film, So this is my First Watching Justice League (2021). Kudos To Zack Snyder and His Team and all the Fans who started #SnyderCut Movement.", "It's better, definitely calls for a sequal but was it great?": "My opinion of the Snyder Cut:Ratings: 8.6/10It was good. Definitely an upgrade from the theatrical version. I actually liked it better than Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition. But was it great? Like Man of Steel great? No. Man of Steel in my opinion, is the greatest comic book movie of all time and also the most underrated comic book movie of all time, I still don't understand why so many people don't like that movie. But was the Snyder Cut, Man of steel great? No.\nIt had its own share of plot holes, which I think could have been avoided.The 4hr watch time actually helped, it gives each character breathing space and a lot of character development especially in case of Cyborg. Each character has its own moment to shine and you get a lot of insight about their back stories. Although I think when you do something like 4hrs long it comes with its own positives and negatives. And the ONLY negative I found is few scenes were only contributing in the length of the movie and not in the narrative at all.But its a Grand for your buck. A 4hour film, filled with a lot of emotion, a lot of heart, lots of action sequence, and being a Zack Snyder film, a plethora of visual shots, and NOBODY does better visually appealing shots than Snyder.Character opinions: (SPOILERS)Superman- The trilogy is ultimately his arc. And I think Zack Snyder understands Superman more than any previous Superman directors ever did. From the very first shot of Superman's dying scream waking up the Motherboxes sets a well narrative of the film. To the very moment when he walks into the house of El, with the voices of his two fathers, Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, with the Hans Zimmer score ... Chills. And the best moment in the film, when he just literally takes the blow from Steppenwolf's axe and just goes, \"Not Impressed\"... Nuts!!Batman- The 2017 version presented Batman in a very bad portrayal and kinda low, but he gets the much much better upgrade in this cut. But I think it still low from the Batman we got in BvS. Which I think The Batman in BvS is the best live action batman we ever had. But overall its an upgrade and I think it sets Batman as the leader of the pack very well.Wonder Woman and Aquaman- They had a little bit of a back story which sets their journey good. But that fight between Steppenwolf and Amazons. But just those three line, \"I'll bathe in your fear\", \"Show him your fear\", \"We have no fear\", makes that scene epic. And in case of Aquaman, the addition of Vulco makes his arc better.Flash: One of the two characters who was severely damaged from the reshoots in 2017. Gets a much better character time. I would have loved to see more of Iris but alright. The speed force thing and turning back time was epic. \"Dad, I want you to know whatever happens, your son was one of them. The absolute best of the best\".. damn! And yes there was humor because their will be, the Flash is a humorous character, but this time the humor didn't feel silly like in 2017.Cyborg- Zack Snyder always said that Cyborg is the heart of the movie and indeed he is. Its more a Cyborg movie than a JL movie and I think Zack Snyder gave a very touching character development. Especially in the scene between him and waitress which shows us the heart of Cyborg and that scene was really great and necessary.Steppenwolf and Darkseid- The 4hour time also helps to dig deep into Steppenwolf's aim and his motive and a little bit into his back story. The design is a MASSIVE upgrade which I loved.\nThe inclusion of Darkseid, doesn't matter for how many minutes he was there, but just his presence gave a whole new dimension to the film.", "Absolute delight": "4 hours have passed like it was a minute. Everything that was bad about the sacrilege that was Josstice League(2017) was corrected here. Music sent shivers down my spine and was genuinely great, acting was so believable and I liked the dynamic between characters, most notably Cyborg/Flash and Batman/WW (WonderBat is a thing ). Story was great, glad to see that Cyborg got justice and this movie has the most likeable villain out of every team-up superhero movie so far(excluding IW Thanos, they're on the same level). This is a movie that brings out both laughter and tears, a movie that has a heart and a deeper message and deserves nothing below 9 and 10.\nSnyder is the MAN for this job and here's for hoping they'll #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "WoW, just WoW": "This was the best 4 hour experience since pandemic started.\nI had 0 expectations especially with critic reviews shortly before release.\nIn short its the best DC film so far and Warner Bros should make Znack Snyder a DC's Kevin Faige and i really hope WB will get a lesson as people who made theatrical version should be imapled for rest of ther lives.", "Absolute win for cinema and fans": "The movie is great in every context and every point of comparison to the 2017 josstice league.\nThe 4 hour run time is worth for the epicness you witness with this movie. The movie is action packed, emotional, and character arc of all the heroes and even villain i.e. Steppenwolf, is great.\nCyborg is absolutely the heart of the movie, and wonder woman and the Amazonians are the best representation of female action ever put in a movie.\nLoved it, and hope everyone will.", "DC films does it again": "Brilliant film.

For the fans!", "Completely Different Movie": "I'm not an hater of the original Justice League. Here, I said it. It was not the best movie but it was a bit of fun, even if naive entertainment. From the very beginning I have been a fan of DC Snyderverse, so watching Whedon's Justice League felt like a knock-off version of Avengers. Let's face it, Snyder's style is very distinctive. Camera work, colour grading, editing - nothing in the original JL screamed Zack Snyder.However, the director's cut of Justice League brings it back in line with the original vision. The character development is much more pronounced, Vic Stone's backstory is well explored, Barry Allen gets a fair bit of screentime... And the movie flows. Some logic gaps appear throughout (but let's face it, it's a superhero epic - there are bound to be some), but by large it's a great watch!", "makes Marvel Avengers look like a cartoon network movie!": "Don't get me wrong I love the marvel movies..all of them\nbut I will say this.

I don't know why they did a black and white release, it was almost black and white already.Improvement over the theatrical, but that bar was really low. I'm glad people found a way to enjoy it, but as a huge fan of Batman and Superman, I hope they move on to someone with more skill as a filmmaker.", "If you didn't like Batman V Superman you should still give this one a try, the tone is way more optimistic and fun that it's predecessor.": "This movie is an absolute win, the pacing is flawless for a four hour movie, the characters are very likeable and the action is spectacular.\nIf like me you spend too much time watching the theatrical version and pointing out the plot holes you will be happy to notice that all of them are gone from the movie.\nAs a small nitpick because I still have to be objective, while the amount of work on the CGI is very impressive there are a couple of shots were it is imperfect, understanble considering the condition it was finished.\nAlso the epilogue of the movie spends an awful lot of time setting up and teasing sequels and spin-off that may never happened, the Aquaman movie that was released can't work in this continuity, the Ben Affleck Batman movie was scrapped and changed for the Matt Reeves one and all the planting for the sequels that I will not spoil will never get paid off unless the Snyderverse is restored.\nThis can leave a very bittersweet feeling at the end. Finally the movie also took another meaning outside of the simple super hero entertainment that it was intended to be originally , it is not only a victory for a fandom, for artistic integrity and for a director that deserves it. It is above all the movie that United people for a noble cause by supporting the AFSP. This is a movie that saved lives before it was even released and will undoubtedly save more in the future.\nFor Autumn.", "Restore Synder verse!": "So much better than 17JL. Can't just stop here.

Although I do hope this movie can pave the way for better dc movies in the future.", "I LOVE U DC! I LOVE U ZACK!": "Thanks dc thanks zack! wanna next ... justice league II !!!", "Flash takes command of this movie": "Simply put: this iteration of Justice League is average, at best, until Flash (played by Ezra Miller) enters the screen.The comedy, until Flash is introduced, feels forced -- similar to most of the Marvel movies. Luckily, Snyder almost solely uses him for the movie's comedic relief once he's recruited to the Justice League -- though, he's far more than comedic relief.Miller's charisma absolutely pours onto the screen and keeps you locked in. The only two main characters, other than Flash, who draw me into this movie are Lois Lane and Superman (played by Amy Adams and Henry Cavill, respectively). Amy Adams doesn't get much screen time, but the Snyder Cut would suggest that she has a much larger role to play. The rest of the main cast give lackluster performances. Cyborg (played by Ray Fisher) gives a great performance, but does not quite have the command of attention like the aforementioned performers.Snyder's version cuts a lot of the garbage from the first movie and adds a hefty amount of backstory. The four-hour duration of the movie is not a deterrent, especially if you haven't seen the first iteration of the film.It is clear that Snyder's vision for Justice League is far superior to that of Joss Whedon (the writer of the first iteration of this film, who was hired because Snyder experienced a family tragedy and could not continue). Snyder teases with easter eggs throughout the movie and ends it with both an epic ending and pre-credits epilogue that demand sequels.Far superior than the first, but not perfect -- Zack Snyder's Justice League is a welcome four-hour adventure.", "Original was good, this is better.": "I rate a lot of movies but I don't usually write reviews. The original gets a lot of flack which I can understand considering the Dc vs Marvel fan reaction of bringing in Joss to finish what Zack started. I enjoyed the original version of this movie and thought it was better than Batman vs Superman. This version is better than the original. Period, full stop, better. When I watched the original it was action packed and the plot made sense. This version however, feels more complete and finished in a way you would never have expected watching the original. I think that the original is underrated but in no way is this version overrated. The polish and vision for the future of the franchise is on full display setting up multiple ways for future sequels to unfold.", "Snyder is a god!perfect": "Forget the last joke version by JW, this film is the perfect embodiment of viewing pleasure.

It's very long and a little self indulgent but overall enjoyable - particularly the second half which a lot more focussed and exciting than the first.I think overall feeling from me: there is a really *really* good 2/2.5 hour long film in there - it feels a little dragged out over 4 hours.The first hour & half is self indulgent, slow paced and in places unnecessary. A lot of the issues though could probably have been resolved with separate origin films for Flash & Cyborg... it comes down to rushing into Justice League without proper foundation for the series.I feel you could cut the ending(s) - they're all very exciting but fan service and feel completely out of place. Maybe leave 1 in here as a tease.(I do however understand that as they will likely never make the planned follow up films leaving them in at least does give the viewer excitement and creates a real \"what if\" that fans will want to see followed up).They need to cancel that Wonder Woman soundtrack because it completely takes you out of the moment it was so overused. Left me laughing out loud every time it played it was so ridiculous.But within all that there could be something incredible. It's a real shame we don't get to see what he was planning next because... yeah it could have been awesome!", "Masterpiece A*****": "Finally after 3 and half years of fighting for this film, it graced my TV to watch this 4 hour epic of a film, #zacksnydersjusticeleague is everything you want it to be and more, DC would be out of their minds to not #restorethesnyderverse we need a ZS JL2, give it a watch and thank you to every fan and @snydercut Zack Snyder along with all cast and crew for making this happen A******#zacksnydersjusticeleague #releasethesnydercut #restorethesnyderverse #snydercut #zacksnyder #HenryCavillSuperman #batfleck", "THEY FIXED IT": "This was everything the original should've been and more!

Do not understand the high rating.", "A bit of an improvement but a bit of a disappointment": "No surprise this movie was better than the original but there still is a lot left to be desired.It has some badass comicbook moments but the signature slow, grim and dark DC/Snyder parts feel a bit weightless and forced. Sometimes it drags on so long you forget why things are happening.If you are not the biggest DC fan it might not entertain you as much.", "JUST PURE ART": "Honestly i loved the movie so much there were so many moments were i had to pause just to take in the greatness", "Superb!": "I never thought that this 4 hours could be that good!\nI really want to see the next movie. :((\nThe slow motion scenes are not that bad, I really enjoyed them.\nThanks Zack and all the fans.\nGreat film :((", "Bravo Mr Snyder... Bravo!": "Worth the wait... Finally, the Justice League movie we should have had in the first place.", "Bring On The Snyder Trilogy!": "This was a fantastic movie that blew away the theatrical version.

It's longer, darker, just.. perfect. Like all DC movies, the story put an accent on the characters and how they feel and how they are affected by what is going on with them.. It makes you think about life. Also, I prefer DC movies instead a funnier Marvel, I like a darker, meaningfull story, but that's just my opinion, no hate please.\nAlmost forgot, Rated R, love this.", "We don't deserve you Snyder!": "Just finished the Snyder Cut. And all I can say is wow. I am in awe.... every character had a better story, the story was wildly improved and cohesive. It was inspiring, uplifting, and the effects and fight scenes were 10x better. I cried several times, some because I was moved by the moments and some because I was so happy to be watching something I've always wanted. It preached unity, hope, and how we as a society are stronger than our differences when we unite. I Loved this movie so much!***SPOILER WARNING***\nBruce was great, Ben Affleck rocked but the stars of this were honestly everyone else. Cyborg and Flash were so good and Wonder Woman was a BAMF!

More depth and better story.", "Thank you Zack Snyder!": "Still in awe after watching the Snyder cut. The Snyder cut gave full \"justice\" by showing the back stories of the Flash, Cyborg and a glimpse of Aquaman's world. I was surprised by the sheer quality of the story that Snyder Cut was based on, and it was so different than the actual Theatrical release back in 2017. Such a great build up to showcase the DC baddy Darkseid, and what a surprise to reveal another Superhero in the mix. Truly an awesome movie which, tbh deserves to be 4 hours long. I hope I could see this someday in an IMAX. Thanks again, Zack Snyder for this masterpiece!", "Awesome! Totally worth the 4 hours to see this version": "I was fixated the entire four hours. The movie did justice to each charctor and let you see into the hearts, minds and amazing super powers of each hero...just as it should be. I can't wait for part 7 and so on, with the SAME CAST!

I could hardly stop thinking about the film after the first watch. Damn, this is straight-up just a great film. Zack really overdone himself on this one. I love MoS and BvS (Ultimate Edition), but this is above them. This movie may just be the best thing Snyder ever made, and more, one of the best superhero movies ever made. I truly can't believe that the executives at Warner thought, even for a second, about reshooting and changing this. Warner, take a note: This is what the fans want. Give the characters and the world to talented and inspired directors and screenwriters, and don't stop them. Embrace the insanity with them. Let them do their thing.\n10/10", "World's Finest": "The best superhero movie, the best approach, the best villains. Took my breath away, completely. This is not only Snyder's best film to date, it's also the best DC film and superhero team up flick, hands down. Let's all forget Josstice League ever existed and #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Thank You! Thank You!": "Thanks WB for allowing Zack Snyder's version of Justice League for all DC fans. It was worth every minute. This is the cut we anticipated and expected years ago.", "Absolute Quality! (What could have been!)": "The film is absolute quality!! A comic book event film that stands with the best in its field! Much has been made of it's length but from my personal experience having attended an exclusive IMAX screening (with a short intermission which was included) I believe a leap of faith decision to release this version of the film in this format back in 2017 would have transcended the future of theatrical releases forever! It's a Must See for any CBM fan!", "Redemption for JL": "I, like many, was greatly disappointed with Josh Whedon's version of the Justice League. It jumped around, was hard to follow the flow at times, and really wasn't all that great of a story. Re-enter Zack Snyder that wrote and was directing it in the first place before personal tragedy removed him from the project. Apparently, Whedon reshot most of the movie and Snyder's original footage was not used so Snyder took back him movie by reinstating his footage and removing all of Whedon's reshoots to create an epic long but fully realized story. In a nutshell, it is Justice League: deep dive. Backgrounds were fleshed out, giving a much deeper connection to the characters and understanding of the directions that they take. Visuals were changed to hit Snyder's vision. If you think you know how it ends, you'll question that as you watch because it was altered so much. This is a good thing. Easter eggs were spread throughout the movie making it an entertaining who's who throughout several scenes. Another way I describe this movie is Lord of the Rings meets Marvel. The movie consistently made me think of both of these while watching. Some thru the look and feel of some of the scenes and others by the scope. Although the movie is not flawless, I still find the Flash character was miscast and portrayed way too pathetically in the name of comic relief. Also hate the way that they had the Flash stride in slow motion. The arms in particular looked awkward in the way the character moved them when running. Fortunately, the movie has more good than bad this time through and warrants a second chance. Well done, Zack Snyder. Finally, DC shows promise in the movies other than just the original Wonder Woman movie. In fact, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the audience rating is 96% compared to 83% for Wonder Woman. Not too shabby, indeed.", "Essential viewing.": "It's the most opulent, ballsy, egotistical, self-indulgent and triumphant-yet-nihilistic superhero movie you can ever see. It totally renders Joss Whedon's theatrical cut pointless and moot.", "Absolute Must see.": "It's not a movie, it's a feeling and no words can describe this feeling. All I just have to say is it's masterpiece for me. I don't know when 4 hours gone while watching this epic superhero movie. Absolute must see.", "Finally a superhero movie for adults": "Nothing against marvel popcorn but give me DC grit Snyder's vision is perfect for the multiverse. Yeah out there is the young adult popcorn universe but this is so much better. Hope DC comes to their senses realizes that they can be the Dark Knights.", "The true version of the movie": "Nothing much to say, but this one is way more better than the first movie", "Certainly a better movie": "Much more better than the former justice league.

What an incredible experience Zack Snyder has created here.\nPositives:\nIncredible character development for each of the heroes.A villain who actually has motivation.Action scenes which are unlike any other action scenes in superhero movies.Some truly wonderful emotional moments!Jeremy Irons as Alfred is fantastic.Junkie XLs score is superb.Some fantastic teases for future...Negatives:\nA couple of dodgy spots of CGI.", "Let Snyder have the reigns": "What can I say? This was night and day compared to the 2017 version. I left the cinema severely underwhelmed with that one. I did the typically geeky thing of rewatching man of Steel and then the BvS ultimate cut yesterday. Before settling down to this today. I won't go into any spoilers. Just to say that it just blows away the 2017 version. How they'll measure its success without a box office I don't know. But if there is any justice Snyder needs to be given control now of the DCEU. And just be trusted to get on with it.\nPS I've already seen a couple.of 1 star reviews on here. Even if you aren't a fan of Snyder or comic book movies you are just making yourself look foolish with such an unrealistic score. Even just from a technical point of view the movie deserves more. Post genuine opinions not unrealistic scores just to be \"edgy\"", "Just Amazing!": "Snyder really needs to take over all DC films. Not only did he add more content but he also deleted what made the other version weak like for an example when do we really see Batman smile? We don't and Zack didn't miss a beat. It's the little things that are important and he knows it. Great film !", "Near perfect superhero movie after the all-too-familiar marvel formula": "Yes, it is long. Does it benefit from it? Greatly. The build up to the finale keeps you on the edge of your seat and the characters are more fleshed out. After watching this movie, I'm so sad that the Snyderverse has been put on indefinite hold. I'd have loved to see the conclution to this Justice League and the story.I don't hate the Marvel movies but they do tend to get tedious and offer something cool is coming, forgetting that people might want to see something they could enjoy right away.", "SUPERHERO MOVIE AT ITS BEST": "The movie is so EPIC, from CHAPTER 1 to EPILOGUE.

Yes it's long, but the film is so enjoyable that the time does not seem to be long at all. The differences between the Snyder cut and the theatrical versions seems small but in actuality to the plot, are phenomenal. This film has a better grasp at its narrative and main plot points. The thing that ignites the events of the main mcguffin makes total since in this version. Characters have actual character arcs, and some character are are now so fleshed out, that as an audience member, I can now feel for. The film has an emotional core now and doesn't feel rushed. Such a vital improvement. I hope that he WB does some groveling and gets Snyder back as the captain of their WB franchise and allows him to finishing his vision of the DCEU. Along those lines... please get Ben Affleck's Batman back online as well.", "WHAT A MOVIE!!!!": "This is how you make a Justice League movie!.\nThank you Zack, WB, DC, and HBO for making this a reality. What an incredible ride/story this movie has become... all the hype..all the fans being relentless... and Zack delivers.\nThe new score makes this movie beautiful and the new scenes give so much more depth to characters that seemed forced before.\nThis movie left me with in awe in some scenes (flash protecting hostages from falling rocks) and some left me jumping out of seat ( Manhunter/Joker).\nI truly wish Snyder Verse becomes the next project...I need MOAR!!\n10/10.

Everything is far too serious for a movie with no real drama. And once again too many endings. Whedon did everyone a favour by injecting humour, cutting the running time and settling on just the one ending. Whedon's version wasn't great but this version is less despite having more content.

Since there are too many topics to mention, the movie does not bore you even though it is 4 hours. Exciting to see what the universe wants to tell and where it might go, but sad that it can not continue. Nothing bothered me except for the music playing in the background of every Wonder Woman scene. It could be used less.", "Take my money for the sequels right now": "Incredible. This is what we should've got in 2017. Nothing against Joss Whedon, but message to Warner Bros. - let Zack Snyder run the DCEU film series and let the money flow in! It could be on par with the MCU!

It captures the directors true vision and scope. The end.", "all the characters are treated with full respect, care and good story.": "It's a much better and improved JL film. All the characters are treated with full respect, care and good story. It's perfect for home release, but not for theatrical release. It suffers the same problem as BvS; It's too stuffed. ZS has to learn to trim away the unnecessary cameos and side stories. he has to do one thing at a time and do it all out just for the movie alone; too many glimpses of the future will confuse the audience. it somehow makes us think that the movie is just an appetizer. the next one is the main course. that isn't right.", "Wonder woman score": "Wonder woman score is the only bad thing about this movie", "The cut we have been waiting for": "Zack Snyder has a way of telling a story without anyone speaking a word. ZSJL is a prime example of that. Being able to finally see Cyborg/Victor Stone's character arc really added heart to the film and Wonder Woman was the vicious warrior we needed and showed that Zack clearly understands these characters inside and out. I am hoping to see a continuation of the knightmare timeline later on down the road.", "Thank you!": "Thank you for the fan service. May not have been the best movie, but it would be a good setup for the future of the DCEU.", "Need More": "Its all about the experience. getting this movie after so many years. following zack on velo just to know what happened in his justice league. it all comes down to this.\nA Great Movie. good character buildups. great soundtracks. idk if it was just me but wonder woman's soundtrack was not needed in every of year action scene. to those who haven't seen the movie, i recommend you watch it. how's it's different from jl'17?. different villian, even the four hour movie is just a part 1. needs two standalone movies(Batman and Flash) and a sequel(JL2), separate joker scene, martian manhunter has an important role, there's no post credit but there's and epilogue. this movie has more of flash-cyborg and less of batman-wonderwoman.", "DC JUST CAN NOT GET IT RIGHT": "Though this was the original vision for this film it still does not work. Yes, it may have been better in some aspects to the previously released version. However, I found myself still rolling my eyes in dismay over the overall continuity. Additionally, I found myself put off completely and often annoyed by the soundtrack.", "Justice for all": "Too many hype moment made me goosebumps.

We got such a great Master Piece. Thank you Fans and Zack Snyder for making it possible.", "This movie is going to resurrect the DC universe": "Everything about this movie is great, extreme attention to details and great lovable characters. Steppenwolf was a character to be reckoned with, and did not act like a hormonal teenager as depicted in the first movie. Cyborg's story was very heart breaking and we'll written, in addition we had a ton more insight on his powers and abilities. The superman resurrection made way more sense this time around. The final battle was like OMG, it can not have been any better. The whole story was very well connected and I will dare to say even beats Marvel's avengers in many ways. This movie could be the catalyst that makes DC at true rival to the Marvel\nuniverse.", "That was awesome": "It's so good, that I don't have a word to say about it. This is so much better than what we seen in theaters in 2017. Zack Snyder is genius!", "Best comic book movie ever!! #Restorethesnyderverse": "Fans fought for this movie!

Zack Snyder's Justice League is made to be legendary! Theatrical JL was fast food. Snyder's version is one big, delicious steak! Deep characters, nice pace, darker theme is what every DC fan deserves. Thank you, Mr. Snyder!", "Watch from Part 6 and on, don't waste your time.": "3 hours of pure bull$#!t, bad songs and forced backstories that you can avoid, watch from hour 3 and on and it's a great movie.", "Completely different movie": "Somehow this feels like a different movie yet you know the basic story line. More character depth, more story, more surprises and you're left wanting more as I expected. People don't like Snyder's movies because he (from my vantage point) brings the story telling and visuals from comic books to a screen and the 4:3 ratio makes it feel that way too. I see people (mostly critics who make a living off of their negative hot takes) complaining about the length yet it felt like it flew by. Loved it. Yes some of the effects probably could have been more polished but honestly if that's what you're picking a part at this point you need to wake up and/or get a life.Amazing fulfilled story, hope he gets a chance to finish this story arc.", "Justice league as Snyder intended.": "This have Justice to the movie I wanted to see, it gave Justice to the characters I love, and this movie has brought people together and inspired them as was intended.", "Hopefully to be continued": "I wish this had come out in 2017.

Don't watch the 2017 junk.Beautifully made. So much to watch. It sets up for future movies that you want to #releasejusticeleague2 immediately.\nOtherwise each character got their deal of screen time which is good. Cyborg time was a bit heavy which wasn't too bad. I'm a Superman fan though. I didn't like the cyborg nor steppenwolf cgi though, they looked too shiny. Only a few spoofs which I reacted on.", "Holly molly, totally worth it": "You did it Mr Snyder. Now plz Restore the Snyder verse...", "Brilliant upgrade": "Compared to the original this is a vast improvement and definitely feels like the DC's version of Marvel's Avengers. Very impressed and didn't hardly notice the 4 hours.", "What's greater than Epic?": "This is easily the best DCEU movie ever made. My previous choice was Watchmen. Soundtracks, Pace, Story, Script and Cinematography, everything is just phenomenal. And this is 100x better than any Avengers movie we got man. This is a must watch. We need a second part badly.", "About Damn Time": "Redemption finally. Snyder knocked its out of the park. Joss who??? That's right this universe needs to be revived and move forward with Zach Snyder at the helm. The first movie sunk like the titanic and now the ship has been righted with this gem. I hope WB pulls their heads out and keep our DC moving forward", "Darn you joss whedon!": "Zack truly showed us how beautiful it is to see these mythological characters come to life, as beautiful as this movie was even with the 4 hour run time , I wanted more. I could watch what zack crafts a whole day without breaking a sweat. That's how visionary he is. Hope warner bros learn from this mistake and finally #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Best DC movie I've watched": "This felt like an entirely different movie for me.\nThis is the JL we all deserved and needed.\nGreat character building and overall a waaaaay\nbetter version! Definitely recommend watching it.", "Sit down DC 'fans'": "I know it is like suggesting you're a fan of 2 rival teams but I love Marvel and DC characters and stories. I have enjoyed movies from various Spidermans to Wonder Woman without prejudice. And there's the rub. DC fans a clearly petrified that the relative underachievement of their franchises will see the plug pulled on future projects. So they are piling in on this, claiming it is some sort of masterpiece and Snyder is the director to lead Warner Bros to the promised land despite considerable evidence to the contrary.This Justice League isn't even the best of DC movies. I'd look to the Nolan directed Batmans for the clear winners in that race. But the only thing worse than a bad DC movie to a DC fan is no DC movie at all.See other honest 1-5 star reviews for the specifics of why this isn't 4 hours of genius. And DC fans, trust in the material and not Snyder and you might get more like The Dark Knight and The Joker and less of this.", "..... Just Wow!.....": "Zack Snyder has outdone himself and pretty much everyone in the comic book movie genre.Watchmen was and is Amazing but this is on another level. Just when you think you have it figured out and sometimes question what has happened... Bang! He hands you the answer and then leaves you with more questions that are payed of in spades. Seriously! This film is amazing, slowly but perfectly paced at the start with just enough to make the threat seem just that more real this time around. The scenes added in are off the charts and the pay off for what's to come is just insane.. No spoilers but I will say that Ray Fisher, Era Miller, Affkeck and especially Jared Leto give great performances and the latter actually outshines the rest of the cast in just a short of 5 minutes giving him more credibility to fulfill the role and potential made clear in suicide squad. I'm certainly on board for the next chapter... Are you listening WB.... ARE YOU! go watch guys you will not regret it... Oh and steppenwolf is great as the big bad and quite possibly has the best end in a comic book movie IMO", "Thank You Zack <3": "The Real Justice league Movie we all deserve.Thanks to Zack for his Amazing work.. and loved the tribute he gave in the end.4hours worth it.I can't wait for Sequel.\ud83d\ude0d", "Thank's snyder ....u r a hero \ud83d\ude0c\u2764": "This is a very good movie..it has been a much better movie than we expected.

Full of heart and custom tailored superhero experiences that is unlike anything Snyder or any other Superhero movie has done. Very well deserved, not a perfect movie but works perfectly together delivering on all fronts. Very much a story and character driven GIANT! #restorethesnyderverse", "Beyond expectation": "Wow. Wow wow, waiting for JL 2, hopefully green arrow and green lantern was there.", "An epic masterpiece !": "Finished my first viewing of #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague and I had a hard time not hitting the replay right after the credits !! an epic masterpiece that sets a new standard for superhero movies ! the music, the dialogues, the action scenes, the humor, the pacing ... perfect !! And that crazy cliffhanger ! I watched it in one go but 4 hours flew by so fast. Even non DC fans will love this movie. In my opinion, this is the best superhero movie ever made !!", "Masterpiece!!!": "I saw a meme that had a picture of Darkside & it said 2nd best DC villain, somebody asked who was the first and it said Warner Bros.Obviously, this movie was so good and completely worth the wait. Zack knows what he's doing and hopefully they just let him do his thing.", "A redemption story": "This was a passion project for Zack Snyder. If this the last DCEU entry then it was one hell of a ride. This is a high note for what a different universe and world DC could have built to differentiate themselves from the competition. Ray Fisher finally got his scenes restored which add the heart to the movie. Flash finally got to be realized as a powerful character instead of the comic relief. Overall is the movie perfect? No, not by any means. This was refreshing because of how tired I am of the marvel format and it's overly drawn out jokes to levitate any seriousness from its movies. It is no winter soldier, dark knight, or infinity war, but it is a whole lot better than the first avengers movie. Zack Snyder should feel proud along with the many fans who fought for this.

The individual back stories of identifying not only the heroes abilities, but their personalities and consciousnesses was astounding. It added to a storyline that enveloped a whole narrative that these people have unbelievable powers, but are still human in the sense that they feel deeply about this world and protecting its inhabitants.

Same plot, same scenes, same dark, but now you feel depressed for 2 hours longer. The little added value is mitigated by the runtime. The director has already proven before that he just cannot handle this franchise.There was... really no need for this movie... But I guess... The internet has spoken...On the plus side though, the baddies are better in this one.", "Really wish SnyderVerse gets what it deserves": "Way better movie than the 2017 version, i really hope WB agrees for a timeline split or let Snyder take on a multi-verse away from mainline batman movies, with affleck as batman.", "The best comic book adaptation ever.": "Justice League - The Snyder Cut - A+ It's been a long time since I've seen such a methodical and well told story. Every detail works with every other part of this movie. Everything has a logical background. Stephen Wolf is elevated from a two-bit CGI puppet to a fleshed out villain with a complete backstory and motivation. Even his costuming is now layered and incredibly more realistic. Every detail of the original movie has been polished, expanded upon and improved. Even the removal of the jokes fits this now single-image movie. This DCU is dark but the heroes, are heroes now. This story skips the virtue signaling of rescuing civilians and instead puts it's fights in isolated areas and concentrates of the struggle of good versus evil. There are no new main characters but the number of fringe characters that were added makes the DCU seem bigger and more populated. A lot of fan service was added, things that fans complained about with the original movie that they either completely adopted or quashed entirely and went strongly with another theme. The movie is now 4 hours, but it is mercifully divided in acts, which make a good point to take a break, or stop and resume another day. I split the viewing into two days. The original Justice League was okay. The Snyder Cut is simply amazing.", "Thank you very much mr.zack": "Thank you mr.

No Words !! Every thing is just perfect", "Long live the Snyder cut": "Best comic book ever ,let's hope we ll get to see part 2 and 3 of this movie \ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udfa5", "The Directors Cut of Kingdom of Heaven Made Me Watch This": "To preface my review, I have not liked anything Zach Snyder has produced or directed since Dawn & 300, but after recently being blown away by Ridley Scott's Directors Cut of Kingdom of Heaven I was curious to see Snyder's pure artistic vision. I never saw the theatrical release.Snyder suffers stylistically from what the majority of directors nowadays suffer from, ADD. Scenes are spliced with incessant jumping narratives as the audience is whiplashed from scene to scene rather than investing in a scene grounded in a coherent narrative to completion. Below is a brief synopsis of the first two parts to illustrate.**Spoilers**\nWe open to the agony/death of Superman awakening the Mother Boxes across the world, culminating with the Amazons sending word to Hippolyta. Rather than finishing this scene, cut to Batman trekking the mountains and failing to recruit Aquaman. His failure is well deserved bc Aquaman nor the audience has much context for the danger that looms. For all we know, Superman just died and Batman needs someone with 5% body fat bc, let's face it, one can only grapple gun his way out of a sticky situation for so long.Aquaman had been helping out this town but immediately abandons them to avoid Batman and retreats to the sea. You would think if a well-known superhero told you evil is coming you would head home to see what's up but nah, instead Aquaman saves some loser he completely despises bc he didn't respect the storm and gets his drink on. The scenes sole purpose is to look badass with the waves crashing around him for that \"day at the beach\" vibe. What's even better is spliced in between this nonsense is a wasted mourning montage of Martha and Lois Lane (better served elsewhere) then jumps back to Batman boarding a plane as he tells Alfred Aquaman said no.Snyder then decides it's been 20mins of half-ass plot jumps, so why not insert pointless action. Cut to WW foiling a bank robbery with the sole purpose to provide the audience with a girl power sentiment of \"be whatever you want to be\" supposedly never addressed in the previous Wonder Woman movies. The true moral of the story is WW thinks it's more efficient to use her amazing speed to stop every bullet of an automatic rifle rather than just kicking your ass. Also every time one uses the Lasso of Hestia you must tell the person what it does bc it's true power is the power of suggestion.Cut to finally finishing that scene with Hippolyta we started 30 mins and 8 jumps ago. The Amazons fight Steppenwolf (an actual quality action sequence, ruined in the theatrical release with a campy score) culminating with the need to light the ancient warning fire and the first badass line of the movie \"men won't... she will.\" This momentum is wasted after jumping a few more times to lay the backstory of Cyborg only to return to the Amazons ceremony of lighting said fire with pointless ritual dialogue when it would have been much cooler omitting this scene entirely and cutting directly to WW seeing it on television.Steppenwolf sends his goons to find the other two boxes, but hey you remember Batman's scene on the tarmac five jumps ago let's just finish that now so Batman can tell Alfred his purpose in finding super people to fulfill his promise to Superman. A good scene that should have been edited together with his previous scenes but remember pointless action and many jumps bc Snyder doesn't want you to forget the justice league has multiple superheroes. I'm surprised Snyder had the discipline to show the Defenders backstory uninterrupted rather than injecting Flash's dog walker sequence as an intermission.What I did enjoy of the film was the 4:3 B&W which makes viewing conducive to comic book movies; as if we're watching a live action comic strip. I also appreciated how the B&W dulled the special effects but in a good way. After watching a bit of the original, this is an understatement. The story overall was solid but really needed the 4hrs bc it's basically forming the Avengers, Thanos finding every infinity stone, then Infinity Wars in one movie and it didn't feel rushed. However there was some dead weight and haphazard narratives easily remedied with structured editing.Also, since I'm here Jared Leto is a terrible Joker. Leto's pretentiousness disguised behind a thin veil of hipster culture can only be suppressed by anorexia and an air of the AIDS epidemic.** After watching 20mins of the theatrical release, Snyder drastically improved this film. Needing some side character to whisper Steppenwolf bc a lack of context or a nice garden stroll during the Defenders backstory to Flash drawing on some rando in visitation made me furious bc this is what studios think is quality. Campy BS!? Never mind the unnecessary Islamophobia. When I saw the \"aliens stole my husband\" news segment I couldn't believe the fat that needed cutting in the first 30mins. I can't finish it. Extra star for Snyder. GFY Whedon. **", "An improvment that is not worth the time spent watching this": "The Good:\nSnyder makes the movie look like a graphic novel. There's a lot of eye candy with interesting lighting.The biggest improvement over the original was the characterization. Spending more time with new heroes and the team makes them way more likable, with the standout being Cyborg and his dad.The Bad:\nThe whole foundation this cut tried to improve is still terrible. The story is an uninteresting boring mess with a dull villain and that core stays the same.The pacing is a boring slog with so many unnecessary shots and scenes. It should have been cut by at least 30 minutes.The self-indulgence was so so bad. The 4x3 ratio is completely unnecessary. And that epilogue destroys all the goodwill it built up along the way.The Ugly:\nThis was 4 hours... 4 long exhausting hours that I'm never getting back... In my death bed I'll think about all the precious seconds I could've saved if I didn't watch this.", "restorethesnyderverse": "A big win! More than what the fans wanted... it'll make u want even more", "YESS": "THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOOOOO MUCH BETTER IF THEY STUCK WITH THESE CLIPS!!

The story gaps are bridged, the characters -especially Cyborg- now have more time to develop and new characters are introduced from DCU. But this movie, too, suffers from the Snyder Syndrome (or as I would like to call \"Snydrome\") like other Snyder movies; Everything is big deal and larger than life. It just takes itself sooo seriously. Come on Mr. Snyder, this is a movie based on comic books. It is not \"Citizen Kane\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". You could be a little \"loose\". Saying that, I can't help but wonder how this movie would be if directed by James Gunn or Tim Burton.", "They finally got it right": "I am stunned! I was starting to forget that DC were capable of creating such masterpieces.", "The long awaited epic": "I couldn't be more thrilled and happy. It's everything I've wanted since 2017 and never thought I'd ever see his vision on the screen but we won and now we have it!!! I love MoS, I LOVE BvS and now I love love ZSJL :) #restorethesnyderverse", "It's real, and it's fantastic": "If WB just let Zach do his thing from the get go, DCEU would be in a much better spot. When you watch Man of Steel, BvS Ultimate and now this incredible film, his vision is clear. Character driven take on the existential crisis of our world when God's live among us. Great job to everyone who let this come to fruition and thank you Zach. It's truly a masterpiece.", "Just rather dull": "I enjoy (on the rare occasion that I pick one up) reading any DC or Marvel comic. I don't tend to enjoy superhero films these days. Same story, same set pieces, terrible scripts.More of the same here, just four hours if it.I think the child like regression of society is reflected in the popularity of superhero films amongst the adult population. I can understand a child loving these films, as I enjoyed Star Wars as a child, but this is where these belong. These are kids films made for an adult audience because seemingly, millennials and the younger end of Generation X do not explore like people approaching their 30's and 40's should be doing to expand their minds, seeking out new things, and discovering great works of literature and film. It's just \"give me more superhero\".These films are not good, and this is no exception. 2 hours in, still no story, just people fighting. Dull", "You can't piece broken glass back together": "I was expecting a film far greater than what we received. There were definitive improvements from Whedons rendition of the film, but even these amendments could not live up.\nFrom my cursory understanding of the film, I noticed four fundamental flaws:The visual effects were tacky at best in key moments.\nBatmans preposterous role and action scenes.\nThe misuse and prolongation of slo-motion.\nThe film dragged on and could have been condensed in a concise manner.", "Restore the Snyderverse by any means necessary": "If you do something with passion and you're persistent, the result is inevitable - just watch this movie.

Thank you Warner Bros for giving Zack a chance", "DCU is Back!!!!": "This is how you make a movie! Snyder is the Feige of DC! That's how you build characters and make a great plot!", "Now we need #release the synder verse": "Superb quality movie even 4:3 ratio that's not problem. Significantly detailed on every characters.", "The League Done Justice": "It's incredible how different one and the same movie can feel. If you disliked the theatrical version as much as I did, make no mistake: This is a better movie in almost every way. Most importantly, the characters were given some much needed depth and backstory, something that should have happened back when they were first introduced - in BvS. The movie takes its much-needed time to make all the leads interesting and completely improves the villain Steppenwolf: He looks scarier, he is a more complex character and, most importantly, he really feels dangerous. Storytelling 101 you say? Sure, but we well know that storytelling wasn't WB's strong suit in this franchise. The only thing that makes you feel bad about this movie is that it shows you what could have been if DC hadn't started to copy Marvel and instead done its own thing and given its directors the creative freedom they needed to create true craftsmanship. This verion adds up to the only movie in the whole DCU-franchise that makes you want to know what happens in the future - which won't exist thanks to greediness instead of quality. I'm really thankful to everybody who made this director's cut possible - the movie finally does the Justice League its much deserved justice. Go give it a try - even if you hated the original version.PS: 9/10 stars because the CGI at times could be better.", "My honest review": "Much better than Joss Whedon's cut. Some terrible CGI moments. Great action. Epic storyline. Great music. Great enemies. Seen that before feeling. Superb character development. Want to see the next one. Warner Brothers Executives are a bunch a axse holes and probably put a stop to that.", "The critics should be ashamed": "I have always respected their reviews (critics) but this is where we should draw the line! The movie is fantastic and there is not a single comic book fan that would say otherwise, whether they like DC characters or not! I truly hope they make 1-2 more movies so that the story is completed! Good job Zack!", "JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!!!": "It's time for me to eat some crow because justice has truly been served. I've stated many times how I was happy that Snyder was getting a chance to fully realize his vision but that while I expected it to be better than Josstice League, I didn't expect anything special. But boy was I wrong, and I can admit when I am. This was a fantastic and epic film, while not on the level of \"Infinity War\" or \"Endgame\", it is as good as the first \"Avengers\" film and better than \"Age of Ultron\".\nWhile I'm not a die hard, I do enjoy majority of his work and this is truly a Snyder film no doubt about it. I love Marvel, but I've always been a DC fanboy first and foremost and I finally have the \"Justice League\" film I've wanted my whole life. This delivered everything we wanted and more.\nThis is truly a different film as even the scenes that were in the theatrical cut are re-constructed differently, appearing at different times in the film and working better. The pacing of the film is better this time around and since he was given free reign he doesn't rush scenes. He gives even the smallest of scenes breathing room which I loved. While you do feel the run time I didn't mind it, there is nothing I would take out. Everything serves a purpose. Snyder makes sure he uses his 4 hour run time percectly. While his films are usually known more for their visuals, this is his most fleshed out film in terms of character development. Each character gets time to shine and make an impact.Snyder's signature visual style is fully on display and it is enhanced by Junkie XL's incredible score. His score gives the scenes the epic feel they deserve and it's such an upgrade from Danny Elfman's mediocre score from the theatrical cut. Snyder also does a great job at making the team feel more like a unit this time around. Their cohesiveness is put on film display in a plethora of fantastic action set pieces. They work very well together and executed some really good tag team moves. So many of his fans fought so hard for this cut and he delivered for them in so many ways. Despite being a fan of his, I didn't think he a film like this in him. It truly feels like he worked his whole career towards this film.The design on Darkseid is great & seeing him in action had me marking out so much, but don't go in expecting much of him as he's in the film 5-7 minutes tops. However, the scene where we see his backstory was a one of the many highlights. It's shorter than I would of wanted but it served its purpose. The scene includes a homage to \"300\", which we saw glimpses of it in the final trailer, but seeing it in action hits different. The Knightmare sequence was good but not what I expected to see. But seeing this version of Batman and Joker was something I'm glad that Snyder gave us. It definitely does a great job at changing our view of Leto's take of the clown prince of crime. This 4 minute scene was better than all his material in \"Suicide Squad\". Makes me wish we could see a scene of him killing Jason Todd.\nCyborg was the weakest link in the theatrical cut but here he is the best part. He is truly the heart of the film and Ray Fisher delivers an incredible performance. While I don't agree with how he went about things, it's understandable why he was so mad. I've seen him in \"True Detective\", so I know he had it in him to deliver a strong performance. His arc is very sad and it calls upon him to display a lot of emotions which he does with ease. We get a lot of back story on him, which understandably helps us understand and care more for the character since the theatrical cut made him almost pointless. He is definitely the one who benefited the most from the run time. While I loved his performance, Cyborg's design is still very meh. I don't think the look will ever fully work in live action form.\nGal Gadot is simply money as Diana/Wonder Woman. She was born to play the role and casting her is one of the greatest things that Snyder has ever done. While I still think Patty Jenkins directs her better, he captures her so good here. She gets many scenes that highlight her skill set.\nEzra Miller was my favorite part of the theatrical cut and he is even better this time around. This cut even makes him run better because in the theatrical cut it was so laughable. It's interesting that taking away the Whedon stuff he is funnier here than before. As a matter of fact the film in general is funnier this time around. His scene of saving Iris that we saw in the trailer worked so well in the film. It does a great job showing how dope his skill set is, while highlighting Ezra's comedic timing. His chemistry with Affleck is fantastic, and I can't wait to see them reunite for \"The Flash\" film next year.We get a lot more of Affleck as Bruce in this and he does a great job. My issue with Affleck in the theatrical cut was that it looked like he didn't really want to be there and was over the part. Here he comes off more motivated and gives a really strong performance. It's probably his best work in the DCEU. I love Batfleck and once again he was such a bad ass. Superman's return works a lot better this time around, the creative choices such as him smiling at Barry aren't here and he comes off like really good. While the black suit looks great, it really doesn't serve a purpose as a casual viewer who doesn't read comics wouldn't know its significance.\nJeremy Irons is a great actor, and I'm glad we finally see how good he could be as Alfred, his two previous outings didn't do him much justice. Here he is given so much more screen time and allowed to really impress. I feel he is more hands on than Michael Gough and Michael Caine were.\nWhile he isn't better than them he does a great job at leaving his mark on the character and feeling very different than them, which is a great thing.Now on to the few negatives I do have. Despite an improvement on design and more emphasis on his motivations, Steppenwolf remains a mediocre, typical CGI comic book villain. The Atlantis scenes didn't work for me much. Since we've seen how great James Wan brought Atlantis to life, this ultimately felt like a downgrade here. Had this version came out in 2017 I would of felt different.\nI also feel that Amy Adams and Diane Lane were once again sidelined too much for their talents, just basically being sad till Superman is resurrected about halfway through the film. Similar to \"Wandavision\", the \"big cameo\" doesn't deliver and I personally didn't like the look.I will say thank god things happened the way they did because no way would this have worked in theaters. HBO Max is the only way we would of gotten this beautiful 4 hour definitive Snyder Cut. Since this will most likely be his last DCEU film ever, he made sure he went out with a bang. So thank you Mr. Snyder for giving us your all, this is his best film ever hands down and one of the greatest directors cuts of all time. If I loved it, I know the people that really fought hard for this cut are going to be ecstatic and so happy with the final results.", "Accomplished Wonders": "Fans around the world helped Zack Snyder accomplish wonders and he thanked them.

Zack Snyder really did justice to all DC fans across the globe and this cut just proves his artistic feel and finesse in bringing the DC characters to life from the comic books to the screen. It's definitely no easy task, however, Snyder did a superb job. The chronological story telling starting from the ending of BvS to Bruce Wayne starting his journey to assemble a new JL force to combat the emergence of a dark enemy is quite unique especially when organized in separate parts. The different parts put the stories in order and gave each character ample room to be exposed to the audience. Some expansion on Cyborg's (played by Ray Fischer) origin story was definitely appreciated by fans all over. The new movie score and dark themes was surely felt throughout the film. I can safely say that this piece will definitely go down as one of the finest in the dark DC world.

All the scenes that were CUT OUT (can't tell you - no spoilers from me!). This movie really does tell a completely different story than the first movie.

This also leads to a better collaboration as a \"team\" from all of the heroes, rather than being dominated by Superman like it couldve been said in the last one.\nIt shows how much more capable some of the heroes are, and the dark undertone allows the movie to be taken seriously when it needs to.\nI really enjoyed this movie", "This is the Justice League We Deserve....": "Not even a single second is wasted in this 4 hour film.

The most important for me is the Martian Manhunter reaveal after the heartfelt talk between Louis and Martha. Some music choices as well. Like the continuous use of Wonder Woman new sound. Some little inconsistencies. And Snyder reuses footage from MoS.Third: This is Snyders movie. Maybe one of his best films.

Batman became a hero again after spending years in rage and hate ,here he is a hero and leader who is honouring Superman after his death via defending this world, the killer vengeful version from BvS is long gone.. wonder woman is helping humanity and continuing her duty to defend the world.. flash is trying to be a hero who wants to help people and still learning about his powers...aquaman is also struggling between his human life and atlantean heritage as a king, and finally heart and soul of DC Superman...In mos we've seen an alien trying to find his place in the world,in BvS we've seen a conflicted hero who is struggling and finding how to be a hero.but in ZSJL we've seen a true Superman who finally became a hero and ultimate protector of earth .An ideal to strive towards...Even side characters like Lois,Martha,Silas,desaad,martian manhunter, joker got small but meaningful part...At last I just want to say this is the movie we've been waiting for our life....If you don't loved this movie don't call yourself as a DC fan....It's time to restore the snyderverse now because without ZACK SNYDER and a complete JUSTICE LEAGUE TRILOGY DCEU is nothing and will fail soon again...Only a full snyderverse on HBO max can save DC now....

As I mentioned in the title, we've finally got Justice for the League.", "Could do with more editing": "This film is definitely different from the 2017 release, but I am perplexed by the many reviews on here saying that the pacing was good and they were not bored at all. For me, that was not the case.Perhaps because I had seen the previous release, there were many scenes I had seen before - but this was not the issue. As common with many action films, many sequences are predictable, with \"convenient\" hiccups to introduce a challenge or solutions to gloss over plot holes. The issue for me is how frequently the movie throws in random sections that go nowhere - an example is returning back to the places and characters we see at the start of the movie so we can be shown their reaction to what just happened, even though they played no part in it, we haven't seen them in 2 hours, and they will have minimal impact on the rest of the movie. Another example is the length of time used to establish the remoteness of a location... which we then visit for one conversation before leaving forever. The result is numerous beautifully shot sequences of total irrelevance.The movie does greatly expand on the origins and storyline of Cyborg - such that it is effectively a Cyborg movie with several hours of other characters. If the movie were allowed to focus primarily on this story, rather than wedge it into a larger epic conflict, then we could perhaps have had more depth and an explanation as to why Cyborg changes his view of the world.Similarly, The Flash is given more of an introduction - though this is much less satisfying and personally I don't feel I am any wiser as to the origin of his powers or why he is as awkward as he is portrayed.To its credit, the movie spends more time developing the motivations of the villain - yet I still felt unsatisfied as to where he came from and how he has the abilities he has. I was also left scratching my head as to why powers we had seen characters use early on in the film - and shown to be extremely effective - were not being used later and at every opportunity. This is an issue not restricted to Justice League, but it is even more egregious in this version than the original 2017 cut.In short, I was able to follow the storyline and the tricks that the director used but I did find constantly jumping between settings to be annoying and clumsy, and a lot of time was spent on things that were not particularly relevant to the plot. I am not at all surprised that the film was re-edited prior to its initial release, and while I think the 2017 version still has many, many issues, it is a much more streamlined and less self-indulgent work.However, it is definitely a significantly different story from the 2017 cut, and if it's been a while since you watched Justice League (and you have 4 hours you don't mind spending) then it's interesting enough.", "Masterpiece! Thanks!": "I couldn't believe it will make the difference in the beginning I didn't even want to watch it but I'm so glad I did !

He treats the art with such total respect (allowing the story to unfold at its natural pace rather than rushing it e.g. Cyborg). His use of sound in this film is something else (from that scene when those women sing for Aquaman as he quietly steals away into the ocean) to the clever use of sonar in those underwater scenes! I'm not going to bore you with my absolute praise of his cinematic brilliance but I'll say this - no one can do what Snyder can do in that department (hate him or love him, he's special!).\nAs a lover of film, I feel a sense of divine justice has been served in the releasing of this film - I should have NEVER been kept from it in the first place.\nNow, #RestoreTheSynderverse", "Unprecedented!": "The best DC team up movie.

Wonder Woman portrayed in this really showed how bad WW84 really was. Flash being less goofy and being more important to the plot was great and Ray Fisher blowing it out the park with more Cyborg exposition and story telling.Nothing was left out to tell this story how it was supposed to be told. Aesthetically, it was a beautiful movie. The CGI was so much better this time around.The runtime didn't feel like 4 hours at all,Right amount of humour, more emotion , more shocks.Zack deserves to be the Head of the DC movies. It can't end here. The ending really makes you want more!#RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "The Justice League movie we so desperately needed!": "As a life long fan of all great movies, having seen all there is to Marvel&DC movies... the 2017 Justice League was a disappointment ..it fell so bad due to its lacking visuals / character developments and overall horrible scripting of the superheroes we know and love!.. Zack Snyder however manages to tackle all of that and bring out a 4hours long dashing&dazzling movie with everything that we could hope for", "Not all the hype in the world...": "Overdone, long, and drawn out. That's the three things that came to mind when I completed this film. While I thought the original was neither here nor there, the Snyder Cut compares to about the same. Given the time to recreate or add to a story does not a great movie make. I believe the people who wanted this release will never truly state how the film really measures up. If you pleaded and begged for what you wanted could you really state you really were unsatisfied when you got it?Yes, story was added for character development, but did it really add to the overall story? It most definitely added length to the film, but it also made it slow and drawn out. This, of course, took what could have been an epic film in to mediocrity. Do not get me wrong, there were aspects needed by the original in regards to the character development.SFX were a bit better overall, but again effects do not simply create a better film. The \"better\" CGI while enhancing the appearance of the film, does not enhance the overall story. With story in mind, the peaks and valleys for pacing were often off. This added to the \"how long have I been watching this?\" feeling felt throughout the film. Zack Snyder has done better with other fair but pacing fell flat in this film.At the end of the day was this film remake needed? I personally don't think so, but it possibly was the film Zack Snyder needed to do to get past personal tragedy. Abandonment is a hard thing to accept and \"what ifs\" can be haunting. Was this his White Whale? Which brings me to my last statement. This is the film we got but it is not the film we deserve, I don't think we will ever get that.", "This is What DC deserve": "Jack snyder the best I seen movie in DC i hope Jack snyder should go on with more interesting Movies so DC can be Best in Upcoming Days..", "Thanks for fixing it": "It's amazing, i have really enjoyed 4hrs kf the movie.", "A complete and mature film": "It'd be an understatement to call Zack Snyder's Justice League a well crafted movie. This is Zack Snyder's DC fanboy unleashed.It balances grittiness with humor excellently and gives every character a moment to shine, even the side characters.Zack Snyder's Justice League does leave a few loose ends but that don't seem unexplained. We are teased enough to knowing the context as well as wanting for more. And when it comes to the main story points, all threads are nicely tied and all arcs are paid off.Don't even get me started on the EPIC AND ADDICTIVE music as well as the BREATH TAKING visuals in this.

Well done Zack Snyder": "Way better than the 2017 Trainwreck.\nDC movies are supposed to be dark and gritty with a bit of blood and gore.\nFrom the start this movie had a way better feel than the first, each character was properly introduced and gave them all a purpose and identity, especially Cyborg (he is a huge integral part in this new version) I don't know why he was virtually left out of the first movie.\nThis is a 6 part movie and each part dives into each character which finally comes together with a massive showdown ending with a cliffhanger of course, so let's hope we will see another Snyder production in the near future which closes the loop.", "It's time": "Having waited so long to see this true sequel to Batman V Superman. One could easily set expectations too high. I sat through two sittings of this film within 48 hours of its release. I was captured from the get go and felt the euphoric highs and emotional lows as they all merged and flowed in a way no other superhero film has. Honestly this film transcends its genre really. And as the man himself said \"I think people want to see my vision of this film... because I take it seriously\"\nThanks Zack", "Totally live up to expectations of fans": "Every single problem in theatrical Justice league is kind a solved in this movie. More depth in characters. Ray fisher's cyborg is heart of the film. Ben looks good as batman. But the biggest problem that is solved in this film is Steppen wolf.

However, the last time I watched a movie over three hours long was problably the extended version of lord of the rings or in the likes but this does not compare in te slight. The only thing that makes this three hours long is the extended, most hourly painful even dreadful slow motion captions that keep rollling over and over and over again. And I can almost expect the 4:16 ratio or whatever to \"respect\" znyders view, however a bad digital cgi doesn't make it good from a horrible one even if you try to reduce the screen for the viewer too see it.", "Justice League and DC Done Right": "2017 release was OK, but was disjointed, hard to follow and offered little context...quite a disappointment after all the setup in Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice. The Snyder Cut remedied all of that. We get the context of character back-stories, more character development (and more characters) and are left with some setups for future films that will leave you wanting more! We also get more context on Steppenwolf and his boss that changes the trajectory of the whole story. I don't know who took the project so far off Zack's vision, Whedon or WB, but whoever it was horribly screwed it up and as a consequence might have killed the DC universe...man, I hope not! Only reason this is not a ten is I believe soundtrack choices could've been better and they didn't need so many slo-mo sequences...a bit overdone. That said, there better me more of the DCEU and the Snyderverse! #restorethesnyderverse.", "The Best Movie": "Great movie.i'm so happy to watch this movie.

Movie it was like watching a new movie all all over again, so many new scenesYou won't be disappointed", "Everything that was promised and much more": "Watching this film I think you'll find there was the bones of a great film in the 2017 version of Justice League that was butchered by Joss Whedon. The stuff he did that I hated was obviously not in this film. But the stuff by Snyder that I thought was bad about the 2017 version was completely changed by simply fleshing it out further.The 3rd act, though largely the same, put way more emphasis on the unity of the team and how they needed to work together in order to win. This was much more satisfying after the character building over the course of the film, giving us appropriate backstories for Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg.Flash was still the source of comedy in the script, but wasn't reduced to a joke. Zack has often said Cyborg was the heart of his movie and that couldn't be a more true statement.Plenty of fan service while still giving the critics the lighter tone they were wanting, the film was always intended to be a step out of the dark from the characters low points in Batman v Superman, a film I think will be received better in the context of the character arc given with this film.The 4 hour run time didn't feel like it wasted any time, but the at the film is neatly broken into chapters will be largely a good thing for mass consumption. This will be a good option for me wanting to rewatch the film on my break at work in parts in the future.Cutting Ryan Choi from the 2017 edition of the film was a disgrace he is a gem.Ultimately i'm going to need a few rewatches in order to decide where this film sits for me in the 3 story Superman arc Zack Snyder created, but that's expected, there is a lot to digest.", "THE BELLS HAVE BEEN RUNG": "THIS.... THIS is what we've been needing all along.... Greek Mythology meets Superheroes in this epic piece by Snyder.Each of the arcs made me care. Made me invested in these characters...

With the expanded time, the movie was able to properly tell the story of each new character.I absolutely Loved this version of Steppenwolf The movie is able to explain his purpose as well as the reason why he was sent first this version of Steppenwolf is much better than Whedons! Steppenwolf isa True Villian in the movie. Scary, intimidating as well as a tough fighter unlikes Whedon who for no reason felt superior than \"earthling\"!Without spending the next hour explaining the differences in the movie and the Amazing Easter Eggs the movie setups for future stories of this universe which NEEDS to b told, I highly recommend watching this movie on HBOMAX.

The movie with the highest expectations probably ever put on a movie (perhaps maybe endgame) (by comic fans) without a doubt was wayyy better than I could have ever imagined. Trust me watch this film. This is the only time I've ever watched a 4hour movie and wanted it to be longer, can you imagine that. I have soooo much more to say about this film, but I suggest you just watch the film, I suspect in the time to come it will become one of the biggest cult films of all time (with one of the richest history's) and will age fantastically.One last note the fact that this was shot on film stock and that aspect ration, really, really made a humongous difference, made the movie feel so much more gritty, real and intimate.", "One of the best CBM's to ever exist": "Amazing piece of cinema!

The story and driving motive of each character is as detailed as possible. Consequently you become a direct participant and observer of the hero formation process. It's incredibly difficult, a fantastic genre film, to be full of human emotions. But here, we see so much excess, usually personal weaknesses, that you are forced to perceive the film sensitively to the end. The story can be evaluated in one sentence. It was the game of the Olympian gods on earth. Impulsive and emotional children, jumpinging on the planet.\nThe ending deserves a separate mention. its leaves a lot of question marks with everything in the background that prepares us for something grand. Also one of the main motives at the end of the film is to show us the metamorphosis of the protagonists. Each of them, from an emotional, unpredictable child, develops into an emotionally stable person. Reassessment of values, fear, uncertainty, distrust, choice dilemma.

The Snyder cut of the Justice League is without question the film which should have been released. Deadlines, due dates, and schedules be damned. We, the viewing audience are not discouraged by release schedules changed to ensure the quality of the product or project. We will patronize it.

This will not shrink in the face of the Joss Whedon effort, and to its respect Joss Whedon was trying to make a product which was intended to arrive for viewing at a particular time.Thank you to Zack Snyder for his effort to bring this forward. Thank you to who ever is making decisions at Warner Bros. at this time, and HBOMax for being the channel upon which this has been given to the public. having said that - sequels are in order. The failure of imagination of the studio at the original time of the release is merely prologue. You gave us these characters in their totality - that's what we wanted. The effort of the introvert The Flash, to make the plan work. The insight of Cyborg trying to overcome his inner pain. Bruce Wayne having to humble himself in the face of all his resources as needing more than just himself. Wonder Woman, with her wisdom, power, grace under fire and absolute ferocity. Superman, trying to see his own humanity in the face of awesome powers. Aquaman's coming to terms with his dual identity and its absolute importance. Character development we did not get in the Theatrical release.Lets be real folks, and it's okay to be honest. This movie's release date was almost 4 years late - the Theatrical was the screener - this version is audience approved.", "Ty Zack": "This film is the one whose we want by the begining", "Justices league": "Better than before!!!! Best 4 hours of my life ! The beginning was amazing the ending was epic", "Completely Masterpiece.": "Zack snyder's JL is such a meaningful and interesting movie that have no words to say.This time Superhero was introduced in a perfecr manner.We want all the future part of Justice League.#restore_snyderverse", "Well that is 4 hours of my life I will never get back.": "This has to be one of the worst dc film I have seen. The film feels like it was just thrown together for the sake of it. There seemed to be hardly any chemistry between the characters. There are quite a few scenes that were unessary.", "The Goat sup movie": "Greatest superhero movie of all time fantabulous story development and awesome character's background story written also super beautiful special effects used on this masterpiece", "Far Far Better than Previous Release": "Zack Snyder's Justice League portrays the correct vision of Zack Snyder. The movie answers a lot of questions which were left unanswered during the original release. All the Heros and even villains got a interesting back stories this time, movie also explains what is the motivation everyone have behind their actions.CGI was by far better than earlier Release.Overall really an amazing and enjoy able movie.Only part which I found funny was Dark Side's walk during final chapter, His legs seems much smaller than upper body, which made it weird when he was walking.", "For once the hype is worth it...": "So I was hyped for endgame... Got disappointed.. Hyped for joker... Got disappointed hyped for tenet.. Got disappointed.... And then.. When I didn't know exactly what the Snyder cut was or even care about the DC universe because they make mediocre movies and decided to give it a try... Man, I was blown away... That was epic... Amazing dedication and balance for every character.. Great pacing and fantastic job putting chapters together making this 4 hour movie like one awesome mini series... Man ,this was the perfect super hero movie experience I've ever had and I don't even like DC movies ... I'm not keeping up with the DC situation but if they let the makers of this movie run the whole thing... I think they will be on top..and the fans will get what they want\n.. I will give it the perfect rating of 10/10 to help them notice how much we liked it so that they might go with this way in the future.. Also for finally seeing a movie deliver which is too rare these days", "Work of Art that will be taught in schools for decades": "What's common with Picasso's paintings, Sylvia plath's poems or Led Zeppelin's music? You talk about the Artist's psyche, the thought process, the behind the scenes work that contributed to the art than the final artwork itself.Zack Snyder's Justice League is that masterpiece that will be talked about for decades. The ambitious world building, the internal tussles with WB execs, the family tragedy, the 2 hour mandate, the Whedon garbage, the fan movement, the allegations and so on. All of this will be case studies for tomorrow's filmmakers. And just like Mank, Ed Wood, Disaster Artist, decades from now, there will surely be a movie made that tells the true story behind the making of Zack Snyder's Justice League.The movie finally steers the DCEU in the right direction. Each character got the backstory it deserves. The story ties up many loose ends from the previous movies and also sets up the universe for future movies in the DCEU. This should be the ultimate canon henceforth. Ben Affleck is amazing as Batman. Henry Cavill reprises his role as Superman. Could've had a little more screentime. Gal Gadot's Wonder woman finally got the respect she deserves. Rest of the heroes had proper introductions with strong motives that gives so much depth to their characters. Even Steppenwolf had more than one dimension for his character arc. Can't say the same for darkseid, though.Some scenes did feel out of place like the introduction of Martian Manhunter, the Gotham Harbor fight scene, what was flash upto? Aquaman was just waiting outside till everything was over? But compared to the anticipation and the expectations, you won't pay much attention to some of these 'Save martha' sort of moments in the movie.Overall, 4 hour watch was totally worth the wait.", "Long and grueling.": "4 hours of utter boredom, fell asleep multiple times and kept waking up to the damn snoozer STILL going on. Absolute trash.", "We want Justice League 2 with director Zack Snyder": "Already watching SnyderCut and, it's really what the fans expected. 4 hours were not tiring for me, I released it in the film. Improved dialogs, the fighting is incredible. Now this is the origin story of a team of heroes. I want the continuation of this universe.", "Awesome to the core": "Please if there's a god let Ben Afleck come back as Batman. He nailed it.", "Could've watched another 4hrs": "What a difference from the first edition entertaining from beginning till end with character depth and relatable about time!", "This movie had green alien": "I won't use any spoilers when mentioning green alien from the justice league guff green alien movie.There was a scene with green alien in this movie and I wasn't expecting it, because I am quite stupid. But then green alien appeared in the film, and it was like a whole green alien scene.So this is a movie that is in 4:3 and there is green green alien in one of the scenes. That was cool. Like, a green alien or something. That was unexpected. I noticed a lot of other reviews mentioning Amber Hard and the feminists, but they should have all just mentioned green alien instead. A green alien scene. That was unexpected.Green alien.", "This is a movie beyond movie.": "It takes everything worth to make it happen.Epilogue was a crying letter to Zack's daughter Autum, at that moment the emotional power was so enormous that let me felt the reality has truly intervened this fictional world. I wish so much Zack can cross over time and save his daughter just like flash did.Thanks to #releasesnydercut made it happened.", "The new gold standard": "If this is not made canon then somebody at Warner Bros doesn't have their head on straight. You can't successfully apply the Marvel formula to the DCEU, like the original attempted to do. This movie has a lot more talking and more emotional scenes than the first avengers, but that is what the DC is about. 4 hours felt like 4 minutes.", "An upgrade for sure": "Although pretty much a limited series, this film redeems the PlayStation villains in the first cut. I enjoyed the flow and character arch's. I would be open to revisiting the Snyder universe.", "The Original": "Kept me engaged for more than 4 hours and it was too good experience. Don't know what I have seen in the previous Justice league. Everything makes sense now and can see the scope for upcoming parts as well", "Phenomenal": "That's all I have to say this makes the original film look bad", "This is what DC movies should look like.": "The Movie shows the context and back story of characters.It clearly covers, Why there was a need of Justice League?\nPlus the earlier movie was incomplete. Though this is a long movie but it should have been long as there was a need to cover back stories and reasons to come, join and form a team.This is DC reboot and I am very happy with it.", "Definitely Better than what I thought it be!!": "To tell you the truth. I thought I'd find this movie bloated, irrelevant and forgettable.I was totally wrong. It was way entertaining, moved right along and I'd see it again in a heartbeat. Not saying it didn't have its flaws, but it was soooo much better than Joss's. Back stories were better and it filled in a lot of blanks.If you got half a free day to kill, watch this. It was worth the 4 hours.", "Totally New movie": "Zack Snyder's justice league is awesome movie. Every character is fully developed & virtual are stunning.the film never forgets to give a personal touch to its superheroes. Must watch.", "What a movie...! After so long !": "Badass- Awesome -Amazing - Superb\nIt kept me intact for 4 hours, need jsjl-2 asap\ud83d\udd25", "THE TRUE JUSTICE LEAGUE": "The real version of the film despite the length of 4 hours is very smooth. the special effects fit perfectly with the script, a masterpiece for any lover of cinecomic", "I'm all in The NEW JLU": "I've never really enjoyed films from Dc since 2008,they've been so pale and the 2017 JL movie kept showing that but after seeing this and being a huge marvel fan...I loved it and is a definite watch!!!!!.", "Make it stop": "Absolutely Awful!I really did hope that the original directors vision would save this film, wrong!Where to start?Okay, what dialogue there is, seems to have been written by a 12 year old boy, only serving to accentuate what is clearly visible on screen. There is no plot progression at all.Fight scene after fight scene after fight scene makes it feel like a very limited video game.The few attempts at humour fall flat on their face.Each charactors (especially wonder woman) theme absolutely must be played every single time we see them.I had to split this up over 4 nights to get through it without wandering off to do something else, and I'm all for a good long film. But only if the substance of the entertainment is there. This is just the same fight scene over and over again, broken up occasionally with some moody looks and childish dialogue.Really wanted this to work, sadly it'll only put another nail in the DCEUs coffin.Hopefully Mister Gunn may be able to save DCs cinematic output, as what followed this was equally awful.", "Snyder For the save": "Simply amazing: better character development connects you, the storyline engages you for 4 hours, the action leaves you on the edge of your seat, and the ending leaves you desiring an immediate sequel as soon as they can make it. This was the dream, I believe of Snyder...and I'm a believer. Can't wait for the sequel", "Better than the OG, but still; a really bad film": "I'm utterly disappointed, by the content of the movie - not the visuals, which are the only redeeming quality - after 4 hours of watching his unchained \"cut\", searching for anything good to say, this is what I came out with: better than the original, but still; a really bad film.There isn't a single thing this movie does right; that's including the aspect ratio. 4:3 just isn't as pleasant, it was common in tv sets because of a technological restriction and doesn't hold a candle in a movie theatre or a modern display. With all due respect to the directors' integrity, it was an objectively wrong decision, and sadly not his last.Choosing this writer was a gamble at best and moronic at worst; 2 cancelled tv shows & aquaman, quite a repertoire, somehow snyder thought \"thats the right guy for the job\". Unsurprisingly, the writing is banal, boring, clich\u00e9 and uninspiring. The few \"jokes\" aren't funny, the characters are shallow, the conflicts are easy to overcome and all dialogue is a waste of time and effort by so many brave nameless (wonderful) people who gave their all for a heartless & pointless scene.The fights are in GOD MODE; where no hero is ever hurt unless it's imposed or by unimaginative writers.The acting, to call it that, offers too much of a bad thing; chewed up lines and unwarranted drama mixed with unrealistic dialogue and shot in a cgi infested set, brought out the worst acting in a dc movie to date - and that means something! Thankfully, some of the actors manage to squeeze some lemonade out of that rotten lemons which is the script, thanks to years of playing the part. Not enough to rise the bar, but noteworthy. Affleck doesn't seem to enjoy a single moment through out the film and always looks as if he's Ben Affleck playing batman, hoping none of them will find out. Hysterically bad at times.There's no internal logic to the film, with problems popping up on every scene and set piece:\nso bruce is building that plane all by himself, as a side project while fighting crime? So alien guns have self destruct buttons that count down in 'earthian' numbers? What was the vision and who saw it? Why no one mentioned it? If you run faster than the speed of light how can you see where you're going? Doesn't the flash run out of energy? Why shoes tear but nothing else? So he's wearing the suit and he can use it inside the box? Why did the cube float? Killing ghostly figures is enough? So getting knocked into a cement slab doesn't impair superheroes? Can they get hurt? Did he just turn back time without turning back time? So he won every battle except here, and he doesn't remember the name of this place? Why not get out of the glass aquarium before you start the beam? So GODs needed an army - the size of which never seen before or since - to defeat them, but a man dressed as a bat, a single Amazon, a man sized flash drive and a fishman is almost enough while flash is running in circles?...ect.It's an abysmal movie. Cementing Snyder's place at the hall of shame of cinema. Hopefully the franchise could start a new without him after this disastrous affair. He should have done better with the high blockbuster budget.", "Shocked": "I have never seen or even imagined anything like that, i have no words to describe what i feel right now. the emotions i felt and I'm feeling, thanks for that. i hope that you'll film the continuing movie Zack! i love it!!", "So detailed and its a film more than a movie . Totally worth the wait": "Every Snyder film including this is just so so detailed and elaborate . Each and every action the characters do is detailed and meaned and every character is so detailed. Yeah it's four hour long but the exact duration of movie is 3hour 55 mins and it's not even wasted a bit its so good and you will not feel the long duration for sure . You will thoroughly enjoy the film do watch it .HANDS DOWN #SnyderCut IS THE BEST", "Epic movie !": "Wonderful movie it's worth to wait this time #justice_league", "This is epic!": "Still don't get it how this version wasn't released 4 years ago.

With my Dc fan glasses of course 10/10. But I also have to say that I still like the Wheedon cut 7/10.But of course the film shows what went wrong in the DCEU before Justice League.\nFirst the solo films, then BvS, then I would have liked a mixture of the Snyder cut and Wheedon cut. The film length of the 2017 version is much better, previous solo films could have saved a lot in the Snydercut. The fights, battles and the ending were of course epic.\nThe absolute highlight in the Snydercut is the Knightmare sequence and the Joker , just wow . A Knightmare film would be the greatest.\nThat's why I rate with top marks and I'll buy the film digitally and on Blu-ray so that it might work", "The best movie I have ever seen": "Best movie I have ever seen. I became fan of zack snyder after watching this.", "A Vastly Superior Version of the Original": "Zack Snyders Justice Leauge is an excellent film, by most accounts, and possibly the best DC Extended Universe movie, with Man of Steel being the only real contender. Zack Snyders Justice Leauge does everything that the Wheadon Cut did better. Every single scene is superior in this version. The movie has emotion,\nI'll be honest, I expect my view of this movie to deteriate a little, simply because when comparing this to the first version, it is so much tremondesly better.\nIt is defintily worth a watch, and I am excited to see where Zacl Snyder takes the DC Extended Universe from here.", "Super Duper Good": "I really loved the movie. Amazing cgi. I would tell more but I want this review to be spoiler free. Oh yeah I'm rating it a 10 because I loved it but my family had a little problem watching it like in some scenes there's like a lot of slo mo scenes kinda makes it look like Bollywood movie.

I am convinced by the story.", "Finish what you started": "I literally have no idea how a human being with a normal human brain would burry such a masterpiece as this movie and decide to release that whedon's non sense version\nWarner Bros needs to learn how to apologize to the fans around the world for the mistake they did\nAlso they need to learn how to respect our wishes as fans because without us there's no money for any film they could make in the future and we already showed them how we can manage that by pushing them to release the snyder cut\nWe need our snyderverse to be continued at any cost", "A Completed Story": "The movie is more full than the chopped up theatrical court.

After watch the Zack Snyder's Justice League i have to say \"that is amazing\" this is other movie compare with the movie from 2017, in this movie we see the real justice league, exist a motivation, a search of faith, a friendship, a love for the characters. I recomend this movie, also the 4 hours pass very fast, also i love the Ezra miller's character , i love flash , in this movie flash is not a clown.In simple word i need see more of Snyder\u00b4s Universe. i do not why Warner Bros decied re-shot and deleted scenes from this movie and make the justice league a clown\u00b4s party. i repeat , i love this justice league and I would like see more of this.", "Beautiful Art with humor jokes": "This is amazing movie.

This is the best movie I have ever seen and all the fans will get the same kind of movies thanks.", "One of the greatest superhero movies!": "ZSJL is an epic saga portrayed with some mind blowing aesthetics and grandeur, with each character taking a center stage at some point of the movie. The cinematography is no doubt a big highlight of this movie and makes this movie a must-watch-on-big-screen experience. The character arcs of every character, especially Cyborg have been shown brilliantly and justify all their actions. The performance by star cast is brilliant and so is the BGM that keeps giving you goosebumps throughout the runtime. The duration of the movie may feel long but once you are into the viewer's seat, the four hours fly past you.In short, Zack Snyder has delivered a film that will be remembered as a masterclass in how to tell an epic superhero movie while each character to flourish and portray sequences in a grand manner.", "Zack Snyder justice league review": "As a director cut it is awesome but as a theatre cut it is a rubbish synder has an great idea and WB will not allow it very disappointment . In this there is many future film starting point .me as a marvel fan I'M admit that I'm impressed to the Zack Snyder justice league .", "Snyder is absolutely amazing!": "Snyder cut was phenomenal. Visually spectacular and so well done in the storytelling. I loved every minute for 4 hours. I hope Snyder gets to finish his vision with a second justice league movie. If it were up to me Snyder would be in charge of all DCU movies", "The long awaited masterpiece is finally here": "Seriously wtf was WB thinking when Snyder had to leave and give it to Joss Whedon oh that's right all about the BENJAMINS. I sure miss the days where the director is the one making the movies not the studios. If this cut was originally released in theaters it would have to be 2 parts no one this day would sit and watch a 4 hour movie in theaters.One thing caught my eyes is how much of Justice League members got their time for a back story compared to the Joss Whedon cut which was also missing in Batman vs. Superman because of the studio stepping in and make unnecessary changes for a PG-13 rating.\nEither way I hope it gets a sequel since it is hinted to be in its own universe.", "Masterpiece Epic Truly Brilliant No words to define how I live that fu**ing 4 hours of life..": "Masterpiece Epic Truly Brilliant...Zack Snyder Vision is too dark so far better than other joostice league his vision of making this film is literally very dark.\nThis movie starts giving goosebumps from start to end when it comes to thrill action darkness this a lot similar looks like dc animated universe franchise movies and giving us a glimpse of apokalips war when. It comes to cliff hangers Snyder sir really impressed me a lot how a movie of superhero is that good and dark in seriousness..and this movie is very much better than endgame in comparison of seriousness so we as a fan really want to see another trilogy of justice league of 4 hours runtime like lord of the rings please Warner Bros please let the fans relieve this epic justice league and please restore the Snyder Verse because we want to see Justice league Apokalips war in live action and no better director than Zack Snyder is understand the fan demand in better way like Snyder does because if u let the Zack Snyder complete his visions then it definitely become the #1 movie of the world Zack Snyder's Justice league ..\nPlease Dc fans support and start petition on #restore the Snyder Verse...", "We All Need to #RestoreTheSnyderVerse!": "One thing for sure is Zack Snyder definitely knows what to do.

The company should give overall authority to film makers (directors) not to bunch of idiots, for example WB EXCECUTICE positions who have no vision at all and totalled the justice league completely in its initial release in 2017.\nEveryone may not agree with me in this part like every comic adaptation should be long so it can lead to better character and world development.\nKeeping my fingers crossed for justice league part 2 and 3.", "All hail Zack Snyder": "I love this movie .

We dont want any snyderverse more!", "Such a Beautiful movie": "Can't believe that Warnerbros thought that this is unwatchable. This one of best CBM of all time", "Zack Snyder's gem": "What a difference when the executives and critics don't get to interfere. Give Zack the money and let him build the DC universe and you might compete with the Marvel one, keep doing what you do and waste it. Overpaid morons. Absolutely brilliant Zach, well done. Better than the Avengers by a considerable distance", "All that was missing was a real Lex Luthor": "I have to say I went into this movie very timid as most DC movies have failed to live up to their marketing. Marvel has somehow found the formula early, do not leave out the details, stick to the comics as best as you can, and build a storyline no matter how long it takes to build it. Most fans of superhero movies are coming from a place of not always knowing the background story of the characters in play. I was very disappointed by the past movies that have come into play Batman vs Superman was barely bareable to watch, Suicide Squad was a mix of plots with a script that had no set line, and the last Justice League was sliced and Diced to create a barley edible movie. Warner Bros has not found the path to greatness, nor will they if they keep canceling out directors that actually have a idea of where the DC universe should go. I thought the character development was excellent, the only character they failed to build up was FLASH. Which they are coming out with a movie in the future lets hope that movie does a better job at introducing him. I also have a few issues with DC music, somehow Marvel is excelled at creating amazing soundtracks but DC has just not quite found the formula. Music will make or break a scene. I do enjoy how each character has their own music when they cme on for a fight scene. I am just not a fan of the music they have chosen. I was looking through the bad reviews and I do have to say Snyder did something right becuase most bad reviews for a movie will have some legit comments on to why they thought the movie was bad. These comments were just simple with no context almost as if they wanted to hate the movie and write bad review just because they could but do not really have anything legit to say. I am okay with the fact that this movie was four hours. I am not positive what they would have cut. There were a few times I thought maybe they could have redid some of the scenes from the original movie but not enough where I was disappointed. I do not want to leave any spoilers, all I will say is that I was amazed by certain parts and characters they snuck in without being ready. I just miss the original joker, I can not get behind Jared Leto being the joker. He is almost to scary for me. Heath ledger found the perfect middle ground between comedic, scary, and sad. Batman series however was the best movies in the DC universe outside this movie. My last comment about this movie and the original justice league is Lex luthor should not be played by Jesse Eisenberg. Lex Luthor should be cool but whicked smart. Rich and charasmatic. This lex luthor is just crazy and slightly awkward not even slightly a fan. Alright I think that is all haha", "Worth It.

Zack once told he made BvS 20 minutes longer than MoS, and JL was 20 minutes longer than BvS.. If it's based on 4 hours 2 minutes on JL, then the real BvS - not the ultimate cut - is about 3.5 hours (just hope).

Each character literally bloom in their glory and no one is irrelevant. The scenery, the score, the effect, the screenplay. Everything is in sweet harmony with each other and offers a beautiful unit. While it concludes some aspect of the previous chapters it opens roads to new and exciting storylines we hope to see in the future. This version differs from the theatrical cut like night from day. This is the successful first step to restore the Snyderverse!", "Wake up WB and #RestoreTheSnyderVerse": "Its a far superior film than that trash from 2017... story depth is amped up X1000! It truly doesnt feel like 4hrs, the pacing of the film is perfect by the time its done you're left wanting more and surprise it felt like a 2.5hr movie. The fight scenes are WAYYYYY better. If i were to compare in grading the two films the first one was a 4 out of 10, this is at least an 8. The villians actually feel menacing, you feel like the world is actually in danger. Surprisingly the 2017 movie used alot of Zacks footage but you can tell they reshot them and the delivery of the same lines were tonely different. Snyders version felt grounded where the theatrical cut they tried to make it gymicky or silly funny. I truly do not understand how a studio could have this allllll shot and decided by gutting the film of 80% of its content was a better idea. Makes no sense what so ever. I'm totally satisfied and i truly pray they let this man finish his vision because you get 2 scenes of the future and they leave you with a cliff hanger feeling wanting more. Nobody who watches this film with an open mind...\ncan say it was a bad film... its not a perfect movie but it deserves to be a top 3 DC movie and top 5 comic book movie all time in my opinion.", "WOW.. Finally Justice is served.": "The earlier version just felt like being super hero movie fan we were cheated.\nThanks to Zack Snyder for bringing this up.\nI am looking forward to the upcoming DC movies, really excited for Snyder verse!", "What we deserved": "The Four hour epic that Zack Snyder gave us is the movie that deserve back in 2017.

Most of the character is explained in the way that non DC comic reader able to grasp who they are (except for Superman Batman and Flash that maybe already well known for many people). The explanation is not detail but trigger the curiosity to learn more about the said character.\nThe plot is commonly used for superheroes movie, bad guy appears, bad guy kills, good guy assemble, good guy and bad guy fight, the bad guy died, but there is another bad guy and cliffhanger. Many story on the movie needs another explanation that can be answered by read related comic or watch another related movie (if available).\nThe movie is able to to grasp the essence of the groups story as the comic stated (although it combines more than one comic story, just like the BVS). The movie is entertaining with it's dark theme. For fast pacing movie fan, they might be dislike the slow paced the movie had but the slow paced things, in my opinion, give the viewer times to grasp the emotion that the character had. by pouring the emotion during the slow paced story, we can grasp the feeling that the character might have. Know your hero before you praise them. Justice league is great superheroes organization with vast member (not just 6) and 4 hours movie maybe will not be able to truly explain the greatness (even if the movie is fast paced).\nIn the other hand this movie triggered the hater (DC's or WB's or Zack's hatters) to give bad comment, since you can find many unreasonable comment placed in many critics site. The movie it self did not promise anything except to make the Justice league story as close as the comics (for DC comic reader it is quite true) but many want explanation, what explanation do you want? the 4:3 resolution?\nMy suggestion, watch this movie and don't skip, if you skip, yo will missing the emotion chained to the story. After that you will find out whether you like it or hate it, curious about the character or comparing with other movie. But if you want a family movie, don't watch this movie.", "Epic end to an epic journey": "This movie is what we should have gotten in 2017, it's bigger, better and has more heart. The characters are more fleshed out in this version of the movie. Characters that were sidelined in the theatrical cut of Justice league, like Cyborg and Flash has way more development in this movie. Ben Affleck's Batman actually has a character arc in the movie. Steppenwolf has a better motivation and is more involved in the story. The new characters in the movie should have been included in the 2017 Justice League movie too. Characters like Darksied, Joker, Martian Manhunter, Ryan Choi and Desaad.The difference between Snyder's Justice League and the theatrical cut of Justice league, is that the new one actually has heart. It's more emotional and the characters feel more real.", "Beautiful masterpiece with better dialogs and character development": "Speechless \ud83d\ude36, the movie sets up everything Zack Snyder visioned for the future of snydervers, no plot holes .

The nations largest selling nrwspaper VG says exactly the same thing, and rolls six dice. For me, it will be like giving the Nobel Prize to a love story inn magazine for young girls.But based on the reviews, I spent almost four hours on what seemed semi-fascist nonsense from a children's comic book.Overconsumption of poorly photographed sunsets, as a background, gradually became an annoyance in itself. Worst when artificial light is used on the actors, and the hue in the foreground and background do not match.I miss someone who can problematize the more or less covert \"strong man\" attitudes, the undisguised acts of violence as a model, which seem to permeate such films.

Thought to be impossible for us to watch. But it is real now. And it is a way different movie than the 2017s Justice league. I loved to watch it. And mostly I want to see the storyline of this movie continue.", "The Justice League": "This movie is a representation of how good films can be when the director is given full creative control. It is nowhere near the state it was when Joss Whedon made it. It's incomparable. The storytelling is compelling and each character has a fleshed out reason behind their actions with a very cohesive narrative. The CGI and some of the dialogue do often feel out of place and cheesy but it barely scratches how amazing this film is. My only real problem is the long run time which isn't exactly a criticism of the movie but I wish there were more films about the characters before this to make it shorter. Anyway, I feel like everyone would find each minute satisfactory. It's well worth the wait that DCEU and Snyder fans will really enjoy", "In the end it all feels empty and unearned": "Justice League has its moments (Wonder woman early on and Flash stole the show in the end) but as a whole with the way these characters were built up and introduced I didn't feel anything for any of them and that took the movie down for me. It felt like I was just watching a CGI highlight reel for people I didn't care about. In fact I would say I got an Attack of the Clones vibe watching this. That movie had cool moments for sure but I never watched it again because I didn't connect with anyone.I think it all stems from the fact that Justice League had BvS as its foundation and that movie was an anchor around this universe's neck. I'm a big Superman fan. Man of Steel was a very promising start but it all went downhill from there. At the end of Man of Steel Kal-El looked like he had some hope in him, like he was on his way to becoming the Superman that's revered. In BvS the audience was bludgeoned with darkness, darkness, darkness for the entire movie before throwing the main characters (who barely interacted with each other) in a brown, yellow and gray CGI wasteland to fight a mute generic villain. The death of Superman (which should have been an epic moment) was wasted because Superman was this morose, brooding, \"woe is me\" mute of a character that was miserable all the time and that was impossible to warm up to (pretty much like every character in this universe). Killing Superman off in BVS and having Batman do a complete 180 and suddenly act like he failed him (as if they had a ton of history) didn't work. And that was the foundation that Justice League was built on which put that movie behind the 8 ball.The moments in Justice League (with the exclusion of Cyborg) don't feel earned because they rushed through all of this in two movies and thanks to that Justice League had to be 4 hours long and heavy on exposition and character/world building and it turned into a slog of a movie. And like I said, I'm a Superman fan. His character is just a colossal waste. All of the stuff he lacked in the theatrical cut of Justice League, he also lacks in Snyder's cut. In 3 hours of BvS and 4 hours of Justice League he barely interacts with anybody on the team and hardly says much at all really. He's just....there, to be a blunt instrument against Steppenwolf. I was sorely disappointed with how he was used. Batman also feels tired in this.I'm also a big musical score guy and the score was really hit and miss in the editing department. The Wonder Woman theme was so over-used it bordered on ridiculous and took me out of the movie any time she was on screen. It got to be like a parody at one point.", "Watch the Old version for laughs": "This is the movie the fans deserved. What WB and Joss Whedon did was insulting after watching Zack's version. The execs wanted a pay bonus so they rushed it and wanted it to be \"lighter\". Zack's version had more heart and comedy then the Josstice League. This is art.

All who gave the movie 8+ review... For example, that (how to say not to touch anybodys feelings?) girl in a covertible...

Since Nolands Dark Knight trilogy is bad pretty low standards on the DC front and this is no better. I hope this was the last reminder of a dark period in DC history where they took cheap turns to try and make a quick buck. I dont even remember the first League of Legend movie and I allready forgot this one. Even though I watched it only yesterday. Why is it so bad? There is no character building. Is superficial. Sure this guy probably did a better job with colors and, music and atmosphere. But he can't save the movie from it self. It is utterly shallow in its storytelling. They barely scratch the surface of the characters. And it's it's CGI organization. This is an attempt to copy Marvel in all ways but name. And they do a poor job. I gave it 6, which is a stretch.", "Movie for the fans": "Snyders version of the justice league is a completely different experience. The character building and side storys for the heros is much more fleshed out and lets us connect with the characters especially flash and cyborg.

But, if you like action, of you like these superheroes, if you like something you can watch with friends and family, then this movie deserves a watch from you. I only rated it 9/10 because it's too lengthy and you lose track a bit of things, but the extra details and background stories of each character/hero this time is way better. Even the new story of the enemy and how it all ends is a lot more interesting. Plus, this movie is dedicated to Autumn Snyder. Show some respect, kept the negative comments to yourself.

The big question is, if it's better than Avengers. I would say they are different kinds of movies. Avengers is great for a fun pop corn movie experience. Lots of jokes, and fun, and great moments.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that wasn't the case. I was, and still am, blown away. The 4 hours breeze by, and I never felt like it dragged. The additional character-driven storylines, mostly Cyborg, add a lot to the proceedings and flesh out their background and motivations, investing the viewer more in them. (And they no longer act like they're trying to be The Avengers.) The action is amazing, and the R rating allows Snyder to pull no punches.

Zack Snyders Justice league ... 4:40 mts ( I dozed of in between) to watch this massive movie...... Now I have been waiting for this since word got out.... and if I hadn't watched the old justice league I might have enjoyed this one...... the movie fills up many plot holes that justice league did have.... Its dark, its gritty and has some great action scenes. The one thing I don't like about Zack Snyder direction is how often he used slow motion.... I mean .. it looks good but even in dull moments he uses slow motion... which unnecessarily drags the movie.....Should one watch the movie yes.... Did I enjoy it .. not really ...", "This is the Justice League we were waiting for": "This is the movie we should have got back in 2017 instead of Josstice League.

IMO The movie is a great example how well meant is the opposite of well done.

He deserve all the respect!\nThe film is amazing! Has no argumental holes and have good action! I recommend it", "Thanks Zack for this": "I have really enjoyed it, this is all the fans wanted. The DCEU should listen to us, maybe is a very long film and the people who are no into this (a regular people no a fan) are not interesting in this film but we need this cause we had a lot of characters who don't know eachother, but apart of this the film is so gorgeus, the photograpy is so cool and the plot too. I'm sad to know that this new character who appears in the film is not going to continue with us. As a fan I just can to say: RESTORE THE SNYDER's UNIVERSE, he has a big brain. I also like so much the evolution of all the characters, cause they have more time on screen; and the dialogues have changed so much, for example Flash doesn't sound stupid, Cybrong has more space (the casting of this two is great, great actors), Gal is stunning, as Ben, Henry has proven that he is the real superman and Momoa is not ridiculed. I'm sorry for my english, I'm not very good on it but I also can't describe how happy I am, I can't wait to buy this blu-ray. Thanks HBOmax for the opporunity and thanks to Zack, the rest of the cast and all the crew who have done this possible.", "For the fans": "This version is an amazing recreation of Zack Snyder's vision of what the Justice League was supposed to be. Batman isn't joking in this. Flash is goofy and awkward but not a coward. Aquaman is established as conflicted with his own destiny. Wondef Woman comes to grips with her role as a hero.\nDarseid, steppenwolf, and even a hint at Granny are awesome inclusions for the fans. The Injustice, and Knightmare glimpses are equally great for the fans.

Worth the hope that we would see it.It's epic in scale but goes deep with the characters. It's just a very full, satisfying, and massive film.Also, it's probably the most accessible Zack Snyder film.", "Waste of 4 hr time": "It's just a remake of 2017, wasted my time. I was not expecting this. This is just purely waste of long run 4 hours time. It's better to sleep.", "What about science?": "DC was once known for its cinematic science and physics. But with this film, Zack Snyder has unjustifiably violated all the laws of MASS and Physics.", "Zack Snyder did it!": "At first I thought that 4 hours of screen time will be too much. But from the very start I understood the need of those additional scenes. The characters of Snyder's JL are complete and their motives are clear.\nThis is the best DC Universe movie. Period.P.S.: it will be a shame to throw a possibility of SnyderVerse under the bus. WB, you have a gem on your hands, do not lose it.", "Seriously overhyped cheese": "This is a very boring and long movie. For anyone who hasn't seen the previous films, you should skip this.There is nothing new in this movie that hasn't been seen in superhero movies before, it is in fact very cheesy and bordering on camp because of how seriously this films takes itself, like when at ANY TIME wonder woman appears on screen you can hear the cheesy amazonian chanting. But no, it is not camp, because it's not even unintentionally funny enough.It's not a genre-defining archetype of superhero movies either, the way the story is told is messy, takes too long to get to the point, and that is without good writing. This is a boring film with boring costumes and without any emotional moments or well written dialogues to back it up, but with a lot of explosions, shooting and braindead action.", "Rushed": "It was a good movie with some big flaws and some little ones.1. They definitely overpowered Superman. The way he stopped steppenwolf with ease and beat the justice league without effort. Making Superman seem as a one man team is stupid, that is why this film doesn't even compare with marvel becuz no one in avengers is overpowered and all of them have a purpose to help the team\n2. I know flash is new and inexperienced but I don't think he is this stupid to not even land a punch or miss Superman. They made Superman too fast(which relates to 1)\n3. Aquaman didn't even use his abilities(only once) should've had water around so that he could use it to his advantage. They shoudve made him a little more dangerous then Just an elite fighter, by giving him a power outside the of water like mera, by maki by him learn.(this point is gonna relate to 7)\n4. Wonder Woman definitely could've seemed stronger vs steppenwolf\n5. Cyborg was good, but lacked personality\n6. Batman did absolutely nothing, (Bruce Wayne) assembled the team and built the voyager, they didn't even think about what his purpose would be on the team they just threw him in there\n7. They needed to add more backstory, by making solo movies and they definitely need to work on character, everyone seem monotone/boring/no personality, only flash was interesting.8. They tried to make it seem like they didn't have hope but it didn't even seem that way. They just depended on Superman, compared to marvel where no one relied on captain marvel they were just glad she was there\n9. Instead of just shoving everything into one movie, they should've spread it into 2 or 3 movies, so that the suspense could build up\n10. And last one(finally) add more characters, seriously this just seemed so small compared to infinity war. I know that zack set up for a sequel/cliffhanger for maybe another movie by showing Darksied but the original group needs more muscle or at least add other groups( for example in marvel they have: guardians of galaxy, wakanda, masters of mystic arts(dr strange), ravagers and asgardians. You don'tPrecisely need all of them but use a couple like how they did it in infinity war.By the way I love DC but MCU seems more interesting, so they need to make the DCEU seem more enjoyable.", "Same story, bad pace, slightly better ending": "Zack Snyder knows how to make beautiful shots, but he does NOT know how to create rhythm or how to pace his movies in the edit room. Its the same movie but with a lot more slow motion, overused songs trying to make every scene looks epic (it fails) but with more minutes to the origins of Flash and Cyborg. And its boring most of the time. But to be honest, the last battle with Stepenwolf is way better than in the 2017 release, and Superman can shine for the first time in 3 movies.", "This JL version HAS A SOUL": "Comparing to the JL 2017 who was a real Frankestein, a disaster, really bad CGI, poor villain and nonsese heroes motivation (someting like Avengers Age of Ultron) this version of Zack Snyder looks more convencing, all the characters has real motivation including the villain or the villains.

Had this version been released in theaters it would have been an absolute hit. The pacing was good, the actors jelled so well together. We got to see so much more of Ray Fisher, and he hits the mark as Cyclops. Everything makes sense, and you're never left scratching your head. It was filmed perfectly and even the soundtrack meshed well. Jared Leto truly redeems himself as Joker and it's a bit sad we won't get to see the Knightmare now. It's an absolute 10/10.

Hail Zack Snyder and his Vision.", "Arrest anyone involved in this film": "If you put over A 5/10 this movie you should be in prison.", "If this what we deserve, what did we do wrong?": "Personally I feel that this version was worse than the original.I felt that some of the scenes he added were just random, unnecessary and out of place, and some scenes that weren't included, ignored some character development for batman and superman. Not only that but some flaw they could of been fixed from the original, such as Atlanteans being able to talk under water, were not fixed and over all i just didn't like the fact they changed Steppenwolf's design.This is my opinion towards it but honestly i hope others agree with me because I really don't want the second movie to be based off of this.", "Absolutely brilliant!!!": "As a DC comic fan, this movie lived up to the Justice league comics and animated series we've all come to love.

Absolute masterclass.", "Definitely improved but could still have been better.": "I liked the original Justice League fairly well (3/5).Zack Snyder's version fleshes out a lot of the subplots and characters, and it makes a number of other improvements. However, the film still suffers from an overlong build-up, redundant scenes, and too much time spent solely to setting up \"iconic shots\".In short, this could have been an amazing 3 hour movie.", "Worth every minute of the 4 hours": "So much story being told with better fight scenes and CGI work. This really builds several more DC movies. Warner Bros, learn from your mistakes and keep this momentum not yours. Step back and let the creative minds like Nolan and Snyder take over? A must see and ready to watch it again already.", "Satisfaction": "Much better than the 2017 film.

He got control & he absolutely delivered": "THIS IS WHAT JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE SHOULD'VE BEEN.\nZack Snyder is really a true artist, if you really understand his vision... Zack Snyder had to quit the project due to his personal issues in 2017. and we had to wait almost 4 years to really see his vision.. It was worth the wait & I really understand the tribute he wanted to give as a father throughout the movie, to he decreased daughter.. All The things he depicted as a relation of a father, the things he probably feel about his daughter.. True masterpiece & definitely a must watch movie. Probably the best movie of 2021 as of now... Theres an open ending which should be addressed in future sequel.. Would love to see the other 2 remaining vision of Zack Snyder as he wanted to make a 5 movie story around superman and theres 2 more to go.. WB should make it happen.... The movie was 4 hours long but tbh I never felt bored throughout the movie.. The characters development is on point. However not much depth in Barry Alen's story but as we getting a Flashpoint story, his backstory will be addressed in the movie.. I truly loved the movie & would definitely recommend it", "One of the best movies I've seen so far": "Just finished watching the Snyder Cut. I'm glad that he was able to actually release his original cut. It's renewed my faith in the DCEU after the box office bomb that was Whedon's theatrical cut. Granted, 4 hours feels a bit long, but it's entirely worth it", "Snyder's best work up to now": "We definitely need a 2nd, 3rd and so forth parts. Snyder's vision is clearly not a marvel one and that's what's needed for the viewers so we can get more variety. We all like french fries, but we can't eat everyday from the same brand:) Snyder is a visionary, a unique director with a unique style. We definitely need to see more of his work in DC.", "Rearranged but not fixed": "When I first saw that a new version of this film was going to released I thought \"What the hell they can change so much to fix this movie?\"\nDon't get me wrong, this version is infinitely better than the Snyder/Warner/Josh version, but is no enough to turn into a good movie.More scenes, more arcs, different characters, more villains, surely contributes to fix some mistakes, but the soul of the movie is still there and is still problematic. Its one movie that should be several, it has character growth occurring suddenly and without a proper arc, several long and pointless scenes, a terrible and boring villain and more. The end result is as mentioned above: it's certainly better, but not good.", "Dont like this to overrated": "How is everybody so good talking about this movie . Bad movie, bad acting ,bad cgi , bad characters and why is it in 4 3 thats the most weirdest choice ever.", "It's epic": "This is a movie very dark, 4 hours of Zack Snyder's movie.", "Justice league snyder is a great movie": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is, simply put, an absolute brilliant film. The pacing, action, acting, cinematography/visuals, and score are all top notch. While the 4-hour runtime may at first seem daunting to take on, the film actually moves along in a way that feels more like a 2 1/2-hour movie. This is a beautiful testament to Snyder using every bit of that time to masterfully build the story & character arcs in a way that feels entirely earned.A few spoiler-free thoughts/standouts:1. The Action: Phenomenal action! It's nothing short of thrilling, to say the least. The action all throughout this film was a huge standout & all perfectly shot by Zack Snyder.2: Wonder Woman: In my opinion, this movie was hands down the BEST portrayal of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman so far. She's strong, feminine, inspiring, and downright the warrior we know & want her to be. She fits into this film so well & Gadot's performance is top notch.3. Cinematography: The cinematography & visuals could not be better! This is an absolutely GORGEOUS film with exceptional CGI. Snyder did a phenomenal job of making every single shot in this movie look incredible.4: The Score: Wow! Tom Holkenborg took on a TREMENDOUS task of composing nearly 4 hours of music for this movie & it absolutely does not go unnoticed. I would even go as far to say that the music in this IS a character that supplements the story and visuals perfectly. It is such a beautiful score.", "4 hour of epicness...\u2728": "It is very beautifully crafted by very genius director sir Zack Snyder.\n#restorethesnyderverse", "Here's to the Snyderverse": "The best DCEU movie I have ever seen, I hope there is a future for the snyderverse", "A True DC Fans Wet Dream": "Wow, simply incredible.

Thanks WB and Zack, Autumn would be so proud of you today, Now give us a MOS 2 ..", "A New Bench Mark for Superhero Movies!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an epic film of monumental proportions. Let's go back in time (like The Flash) the original concept for Man of Steel came from David S Goyer while he and Christopher Nolan were writing TDKR. They hit a creative wall and took a break. When they check on each other to see if there was any progress, David, \"No. But I have an idea for a Superman movie.\" That is Man of Steel.

Under Zach Synder direction & co-writing, this story is much more richly crafted, which gives the actors real opportunity to breathe life into each character. The lengthy fight scenes that overwhelmed the story in 2017, have been tightened up considerably & serve to move the story along, verses just action for the sake of it. Each superhero's story arc is well defined & represented. Characters of Cyborg, Aquaman, & especially The Flash, are given much more maturity. Wonder Woman & Lois Lane each have a bigger part to play here than in the 2017 release. Even Batman is no longer the weary, road worn warrior. The epilogue leaves me wanting a Justice League 2 with this same cast! Regardless of your feelings about the 2017 Justice League, I urge you to watch this version! #TheSnyderCut", "A real triumph!": "An absolute triumph!

Whedon literally butchered this film, but it was not all his fault. I think he was just following orders from a higher power at WB. I think he was forced to do something much lighter and shorter. Most films are set to these boundaries, but Snyder has shown us that when genius meets freedom, a true piece of art can come to life. I just can't help but wonder how many films have been destroyed by time, bureaucracy and executive power boundaries.I loved this film. It is something different and unique, and even though it has it's flaws I think it really captured the dark and gritty DC tone.

Snyder understands these characters and the lore and meaning that we have built around them since the 1930s. He honors that legacy by fitting each movie in his saga to a slightly different tone that best serves those characters. If Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was an ode to the gritty, sprawling crime stories that define Batman comics, then \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" takes on the epic scope and scale and heartwarming character interactions that have made the Justice League of America comics so iconic. The trilogy from Man of Steel, BVS, and Justice League gives the characters so much depth and draws them with such care that even if you want to quibble with artistic choices here or there, Snyder shows you how this can better reveal what the heart of the character is all about. His Justice League is paced so that character beats have the same impact as his astoundingly huge action setpieces. What's best about the film is the effortless way it brings in dozens of comic book staples (Arkham Asylum, Darkseid, Deathstroke and more) in teases that would have been a perfect setup to a sprawling extended film universe. It's unclear whether we'll get more films that align with that vision, but I have never been more excited than I am at imagining the possibility of seeing Lex Luthor once again, or Deathstroke fighting Batman, or Batman teaming up with the Joker in an apocalyptic universe. I am so, so thankful we got a chance to see this version and see Zack's passion for these characters once again. As a standalone, this film is beautifully shot, with an amazing, chilling score and incredible performances from the whole cast, who really make you feel for these characters. Please, powers that be, if you're listening, give us more of what Zack had planned, because it has been incredible.", "New cut, new movie.": "This is a completely different experience than the previous cut.

I love the fighting choreography, the story is much improved and it is complete. The characterization was also wonderful! The atmosphere was much darker which fans want, yet it was epic and thrilling. Definetely worth-watching and it is a MUST for Zack Snyder to make the sequel of this!", "This is the justice league we deserve, thanks zack snyder": "A completely different movie from the one we saw in 2017, hundreds of times better than it, and one of the best Super Heroes movies I watchedEvery character has given their space in this film, and even the villains in the film have prestige and much stronger and better than the previously one.All the characters were awesome, but I was always stand to BatmanEnjoy and live this epic in all its details, I didn't catch any boredom within 4 hoursThanks Zack Snyder, and I hope he completes his project in his mind because it is clear that he can expand the world, or catch a new project with his vision and take it out in the DC film world without interference from Warner Bros!", "The time I spent watching this movie": "The time I spent watching this movie, was best 4 hours of my life! It was really worth it!", "While watching I laughed, I cried, Got Goosebumps. This movie is spectacular.": "Just Finished this movie and seriously speaking, I'm loving it. After 2017,I never thought I got to see this movie but I got and My god what a movie this was. A must watch superhero flick. A masterpiece in many sense. Hoping to see the sequel .", "No remake needed": "There were some good scenes. But it wasn't remake & extension needed for this movie. But some people didn't like the first one.", "This Justice League... is the one we deserved": "Makes the other version JV League at best. Holy h-e double hockey sticks... from beginning to end", "Great!": "Its just the perfect rival to the MCU! I felt like i was watching a proper DC movie. Felt that this was the avengers but in DC verse.", "The natural order of spectacular cinematography has been restored.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League does in 4hrs what Avengers did in an entire saga. Not only does ZSJL unite a team of superheroes, it gives each one the opportunity to flourish in their own subplots and become approachable to the audiences. It pits them against a hulk bristling with thorns and who cleaves through enemies with his axe (Steppenwolf) and asks of them to take on the perilous task of resurrecting Superman, even fight Superman, because without him they can't hope to save mankind from Steppenwolf and whatever plans Darkseid has. This film is phenomenal and I can't wait to see what Zack Snyder does next. A spectacular feat of movie entertainment, full of hope and perseverance, going against all odds no matter what, and going through the undulating waves of emotion as we explore the inner world and lives of godlike people. Well done Zack. Once again you've raised the bar.", "Release The SnyderCut in Cinemas": "SnyderCut Justice League is way far better than the previous one. This movie has all that that missing details which has to be shown in the previous movie. According to me Zack Snyder showed why it is called the justice League because it contains many Super Heroes and how they will work like a team by supporting each other during the fight. The screen time of every character was good but it can be improved in the upcoming Movies of the DC Universe.", "JL : Snyder cut": "Up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky.\nFantastic", "Better than the first.": "Definitely an improvement on the first, but long winded and tons of plot issues.", "#ResurrectTheSnyderverse #RestoreTheSnyderverse": "Zack Snyder gave us everything that we wanted in a Justice League movie there were aspects of it that I would have liked to have seen done a little better CG work as well as storyline. The idea of Lois potentially being pregnant without the understanding of how long has been in between Superman's death and Justice League resurrecting him. The character development backstories was a much needed scenario for this film to get a better insight of who they are and where their hearts lie overall I enjoyed this movie. The film left me wanting more and moreI hope that like resurrecting Superman they resurrect the Snyder verseAnd make this film Canon. Zack Snyder deserves to be at the head of the table for all future DC films", "Far far far better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "One hell of a movie. Beautifully crafted. Its worth the wait. Snyder did the best to sync everyone accordingly.One deserving movie. People should try to understand the movie more than commenting.", "I want Snyderverse": "All superheroes have an important role, no one is insignificant. With an ending that shows this story is far from over, I wanted a continuation of this series. I want Snyderverse!", "Oh yeah!": "Perfection! Why the heck they didn't release this version at cinema's? Well done Zack!", "Zack Snyder has restored my faith in the DCEU": "Snyder's cut has done alot of 'Josstice' to the Whedon version of 2017. Epic, Grandiose and brought alot of wholistic character development to the league. I demand sequels of all characters built from this film all directed by Zack Snyder himself. He gets it!", "ONE OF THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIES": "No hay palabraa para lo que acanp de ver. Supera por mucho la version de cine. SE HIZO JUSTICIA, TENEMOS LA PELICULA QUE SIEMPRE DEBIO SER. ALELUYA", "There's an error its not a 4 hours movie!!": "We've got something to cheers in these tough times. As the movie progresses it just grips more and more with all the characters. And the final fight scene. Oh god, just epic. Loved it!! \ud83d\ude0d", "We've seen this before.....mostly": "At 4hrs long it is too much, I personally struggled with it and that was partly due to me hating the first one and this one being so familiar and largely due to the pacing issues of it all, too many slow motion scenes, way too many slow motion scenes, a decent amount of unnecessary filler. The score was good except whenever Wonder Woman appeared!!, what was that, drunk old ladies trying to sing? The characters looked suicidaly depressed but that fitted in with the morbid tone of the visuals, they look dead, devoid of any life. The characters seemed better this time round, more fleshed out, Gal Gadot for me still struggles with delivering lines, Cyborg and Flash were done \"justice\" this time round which was great to see.\nIt is a much better film than the first one although eerily similar until the last hour or so, this is not surprising when you consider Snyder worked on the first one first before Whedon took over. I was not entertained for most of the film, again this maybe due to the similarity to Whedons pile of rubbish. The last hour was better as I felt I was watching something new then. All in all it was better than the first one by a old way but it was not great as all these DC and Snyder fan boys are trying to say. I need to say that this has shown that Whedon really did have a job on having to cut 4hrs of footage into 2hrs of runtime for the execs, no wonder he had to do reshoots and rewrites as trying to rework 4hrs of some else's footage into 2hrs would of been a monumental job.", "What a movie !!!!": "I am speechless , the movie has everything , storytelling , amazing CGI, fight scenes and effects , charachters developing , music , every point is on its place ! And 4 hours was nothing , even wanted more", "Zack Snyder's Justice League. GOOD": "This movie has to be the best movie in all superhero movies and has to be the movie of the year because this movie was just so amazing!!! I hope that they make it to where they'll let Zach Zander make and finish his vision and hopefully he does because this was just so amazing, I loved every bit and part of this movie. And they music he had put along with the scenes and wonder woman and the Amazon's, it was just great. Loved how the darkside and stephenwolf looked, it was great, I still feel like the no killing is something they should've followed because the justice league does not kill but it was just so great though. But if you haven't watched this movie but you want to, I highly recommend it,their were sometimes a bit sad parts,I'm not gonna spoil the ending but your gonna love it, it's that good.", "DC Is Back!": "Zach Snyder has struck the right cords with this remake of the Justice League. Instead of an Avengers lite, DC needs to stick to this darker, moody, more violent tone that sets it apart. This movie is something special because it's not like marvel, not because it tries to be marvel. The character exposition is on point and there's a building crescendo of the story that wasn't in the original cut. We need more of the DC universe and I hope this movie is what prompts a revival.", "best of the best!!!": "No loop holes,every character maintains there importance. Overall it's a masterpiece!!!\n#restorethesnyderverse", "Justice League we deserve": "This is what JSL was supposed to be, hoping for more", "THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF ALL TIME!": "And also one of the best movie ever made!

Fans deserve it.", "What a victory!": "This movie is the perfect continuation to the DCEU Snyderverse and it leaves you wanting more! This is also a victory for fans and the director himself. They said the age of heroes would never come again... It really does have to!", "Justice League as it should have been from the beginning.": "(Just a very small spoiler ahead, be careful)\nFirst of all, what I am reviewing here is a move coming from a graphic novel. It takes inspiration from DC comics and in great part from Frank Miller's Batman. It's not a movie that aspire to be the Accademy winner in every category, it's entrateinment. Just pure 4 hours of entrateinment coming from some superheroes' comics. This is not a movie from Kubrick, Fellini, Scorsese or Malick. This is a movie by Zack Snyder, a director who signed every single movie he made with his specific trait. And the way his movies are made may not be appreciated by some, I understand very well. This is why you can just love or hate Snyder's movies. And I love them, every single one. 300, Sucker Punch, Watchmen were movies I fell in love the moment I watched them, and I did not know Snyder yet, I just watched the movie. Years later I found out they were all by the same director!\nNow, back to the subject. Justice League (2017) was a real disappointment. The moment I watched I could not believe it was a Snyder movie. And I understood why when I searched the web about some review: it was not what Snyder wanted. He had to leave the movie halfway and WB changed the director to complete it. What a mistake!\nAnyway, a few years later here comes the new \"director's cut\", the movie it was supposed to be since the 2017. And it is beautiful.\n4 hours that flow very quickly, so quickly that at the end I was asking for more. It could not end so \"early\". There are so many stories to be told yet. So many things that could still happen. But, as far as we know today, it won't happen. There will not be another movie by Snyder about Batman, Superman, the Justice League and all the other characters of the movie.But \"hope (S) is the last to die!\"\nAnyway, the movie is a tipical Snyder movie. Slow motion, great action, fatastic computer graphics, dark atmosphere, almost no jokes (sorry, this is DC, not Marvel and even more: NOT Infinity war/Endgame, those two were terrible in my opinion). For me Marvel are the \"teenage to 30yrs old\" comics and DC is for \"30+ old comic geeks\". And I am 52yrs old.\nI love the DC most tormented character, such as Batman and Superman. I love Frank Miller's Batman. And Ben Affleck portraied the perfect Miller's Batman (and I am getting more and more sure that Ben Affleck did a better job than Christian Bale). I loved also (SPOILER!!) the short appearance by Jared Leto at the end, and the way his Joker has evolved. I think he was inspired by Heath Ledger's Joker, and did a great job, even if for just 4-5 minutes. The only blemish I can think of is about Alfred (Jeremy Irons) who did not reach the great interpretation by sir Michael Caine.\nSo if you like DC comics and Snyder's style you will not be disappointed by this movie.", "Melodramic Scenes!!": "The way the story connects with Zack's ideas is just melodramic. You're 100% invested into each and every scene. In no way, even comparable to the horrendous JL released in 2017. The scenes, the thoughts, the emotions; everything was alive and to-be-felt.", "Damnn Justice League on another Level": "It is one of the best DC movies you can ask for, totally worth it", "Best CBM team-up of all time": "The plot is so clear this time around. No nonsense humor scene. True to the character.

The only thing that could have made it better, if you ask me, is if we got an introduction to Hal Jordan, and 2 cgi shots I thought looked a little odd. But that's it.

Get real.\nGlad I watched it, because it had one of the most hilarious scenes in existence, Batman in his ejector seat... damn.\nAnyway, watch the movie simply for what it represents, a big middle finger to overbearing film industry studios, but don't watch it and convince yourself it is good. Because it's not any better than the WB version, only a different brand of bad.", "Amazing Job Zack Snyder!": "This movie was amazing! simply one of the best superheroes movies with TDK and Thor Ragnarok.4h is daunting at first, but the pacing is actually perfect. There's not a single dull moment. The fact that it's divided in part 6+1 part is perfect for bathroom and snack break.\nThis movie is beautiful and the CGI was really great compared to other DC films. Every frame is like an artwork sort of like a Ghibli Movie. Eyes candy one would say.\nI feel like this movie was very good because we were able to see the full vision of Zack Snyder without minimal interference from the studio.My favorite DC films so far.Kudos to Zack Snyder.", "Amazing extra details and plot changes !!": "I am really glad to see the original version of Justice League(Snyder Cut) released , what a difference !\nChanging the character of Batman from a scared useless wussy, to the powerful wise full of faith leader .. showing the history and life details of cyberg, adding a lot of details about the life and role of Flash, the real return of Superman, the strength of Steppenwolf , showing the rest of the evil team , the second part of the destroyed earth dream , and tons of Easter eggs for future movies !! Well done !! I hope more movies are based on this !!", "Most spectacular superhero film of all-time. Restore The Snyderverse": "The Journey to ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE was a battle in and of itself that I could go into for hours, but to sum it up... We waited over 8 years, since 2013's Man Of Steel, to wrap up the story of the Birth, Death and Rebirth of an alien immigrant from outer space who gave everything to the world-the best live-action Superman we will have ever seen. Just like the fictional world's response to Superman, the real world's response to Zack Snyder's Superman and subsequent DC Universe was met with constant ridicule, with the misunderstanding of the most important and recurring themes of Kal-El and these heroes. These misguided and shortsighted critiques led to Batman v Superman being heavily edited, removing essential content, and then proceeding to be criticized for missing material. Warner Bros changed course, Zack Left JL due to a tragedy and in 2017 we were left with an absolute disaster of a film now known as Josstice League, a complete and utter catastrophe on all levels. After 4 years of constant fighting and fan campaigning with the now historic #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement, and over half-a-million dollars donated to Suicide prevention later, we have achieved what was thought to be a pipe dream, something that would never happen.The infamous, legendary SNYDER CUT is out now on HBOMAX and the film is absolutely spectacular and a triumph in every way imaginable. An undeniable, vindicating passion project, Not only were the fans right about this film outclassing the '17 version by miles, but This film ends up being the best DC film ever put out and ends up being the most spectacular and grand comic-book film adaptation that has ever been released to this day. Not only does Zack thoughtfully and carefully wrap up all the threads he started sewing in Man Of Steel and BvS, he plants seeds of the larger DC universe that we could watch grow for years and years to come, and he does this in the most epic way imaginable.The scope of his storytelling and path building for the future is absolutely epic and immersive, with a mythological take on these DC heroes that gives us proper time and many meaningful moments with every character involved. Even those who only seem to be smaller, supporting characters have rich and flowing personal stories that are extremely essential to the story as a whole. Every single hero and villain had time to shine and time to properly introduce and start their story. The standout for me were Ray Fisher as Vic Stone/Cyborg, who after being completely shafted and tossed to the side in 2017's version, shows that his frustration was completely justified, as he is the HEART and SOUL of this film in so many ways. A cathartic, and powerhouse of a performance from Ray, with a rich and emotional backstory that is truly the center of the entire film. What Ray does in the role, what the role and character stands for, will go down as one of the most meaningful and significant additions to a comic-book film of all-time. Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash was also really well-done, his character had humor, heart, he stole every scene he was in and had the start of a really great story with his introduction. The Flash also shines in not only his best live-action scene of all-time, but one of the most spectacular and well-done sequences in any superhero film. The development with Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman was also a huge standout. Fueled by Kal-Els important and life-changung sacrifice, Bruce forms the team to defend the world, showing him change from BvS into a more hopeful leader, set on protecting humanity and living up to the promise he made to Superman on his grave. Unlike the previous JL film, Superman's return actually MEANS SOMETHING. Bittersweet and carrying a ton of weight, Henry Cavill once again shines in the role, showcasing the rebirth and redemption of Kal-El in a way that feels earned and extremely significant. I truly hope we see more of him as Superman.Every bit of this film is top-notch, masterful filmmaking. Unlike the'17 version in practically every way imaginable, the action goes above & beyond, absolutely epic. Every hero gets a spot to shine and showcase their abilities, and when the entire team gets together for the first time it feels like we(and they) earned the moment, a genuinely amazing team-up to save the world.The villains are intimidating and complex, and even though Steppenwolf has an understandable motivation of restoring his honor, he is not humanized enough to take away from how evil and menacing he is. Ciaran Hinds was fantastic as the disgraced military leader of Apokolips, a terrifying villain that shows no mercy, with a rich backstory fueling his motivations, a complete turnaround from what we previously saw. Ray Porter is DARKSEID, though only heavily teased, he ABSOLUTELY crushes this role, making you feel every bit of every moment he is in and making you want to see more of this ruthless, tyrannical force!! Darkseid was done insanely well, showed zero remorse and his set-up for future films was perfect, the best DC villain was done justice and then some... Jack Kirby would be proud!! Studios should take notes on these villains.The aspect ratio was the right choice, and even though it isn't in a wide-screen format, every scene still feels larger than life, like a splash-page of art in a comic-book, jumping off the page with pure artistry and eye-popping visuals. Fabian Wagner's cinematography was extravagant to say the least, the scope and scale of some of these bigger shots can't help but make you think of Jackson's LOTR epic, oozing with legendary, mythological elegance. While the larger scale shots are epic to say the least, The smaller scale shots of the characters are beautiful, lingering, intimate looks on the innermost struggles and triumphs of every character.Junkie XL's score, by its very nature, is a character all on it's own, pounding with heroic grandeur and delicate personal notes. These themes not only elevate all of it's new scenes to monumental levels, but also uplifts and cleanses any scenes that didn't have the accompanying score in the previous version. This score makes familiar scenes that whedon shot, feel night and day different. The rendition of Hallelujah at the end was absolutely heartbreaking and all of the other songs on the soundtrack fit their respective scenes to perfection, great choices all-around.With a 4 hour runtime, some might think the film will drag or be boring, though it is quite the opposite. The film never feels like it is dragging, with the pace and editing complimenting the film every bit of the way. The chapters were a great addition, and is one of many reasons the film feels so epic. Every character, every story and every bit of this film is oozing with masterful filmmaking, deep love, care and understanding of their characters, origins and personal journey and struggle. The Comic-Book religious, socio-political and philosophical motifs and parallels are legendary, some of the best in the history of media...nothing has ever been done to this scale. Personal, relatable and mythologically epic. This movie made me cheer, made me laugh, made me cry and made me hopeful for the future. This is the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie I've always wanted to see. This is the best adaptation of these characters I have ever seen. This is the best portrayal of SUPERMAN to this day, with the character development and personal story that will go down in history. One of the all-time best portrayals of WONDER WOMAN, and BATMAN. This is the most epic and spectacular superhero film of all-time and this is one of the greatest comic and film trilogies to exist. The care and love given to this world, these characters, heroes and villains, and their stories is something I'll ALWAYS want to see more of. An absolute knockout...I am blown away and then some...10/10 #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "#RestoretheSnyderverse - Thank you Zak Snyder!": "Can't believe how good this was!This film is an Epic and Masterful experience in filmmaking. It also delivers exactly what the fans of DC, that have so staunchly defended the DCEU and its mixed bag of films to date - so much so they fought for the release of the much talked about 'Snyder Cut' of Justice League 2017.For context - Zak Snyder had wrapped filming on JL 2017 but (understandably) stepped away from the project in post production after a very personal family tragedy.In came 'Avengers' director Joss Whedon to 'finish the project' for the theatrical release. Whedon, in many people's opinion, did the opposite. He changed the film. Not little changes or minor reshoots either.Aside from the controversy and allegations that has been levelled at Whedon's on set behaviour since the film came out. Te movie itself did not do well at all with critics or fans of the franchise, especially from a filmmaking standpoint.For example, this was not a movie. It was an abomination of what appeared to be a movie trying really hard to be Marvel, and with editing that shredded Snyder's original vision down into a 2 hour derivative, formulaic and ultimately boring as all hell JL movie. And for some fans that was the last straw. Especially after Suicide squad - Some gave up on the franchise, and understandably after yet another disappointment.Some of the worst offences in the original (in no particular order) are: What they did to Batman and Steppenwolf with reshoots. How they entirely omitted essential character building sequences for the Flash and Cyborg, who are entirely different characters.And so on, and so on.It's ridiculous to me how the ones at the top (WB) can look at what they had in ZS original vision and decide to butcher it so badly. It's one of the great miscarriages of justice towards such a talented and under-appreciated filmmaker in Zak Snyder. And I'm starting to really believe we all should of had more faith and patience in his plan for this DC universe.But enough about that disaster in 2017 and now onto the triumph of the Snyder cut and what stood out to me.....First of all, this movie benefits from being close to 4 hours long. Also with this movie being 6 chapters long, it breaks up the movie well and I'm some ways makes it feel nicely paced.They use every second of the extended runtime to fill the screen with such grand and epic cinematography that works in complete unison with the more than phenomenal score/soundtrack by Junkie XL.I had gladiator vibes when the score turned into an eerie and mythical theme to the Amazons - and how masterfully it transitioned into WonderWoman's iconic theme tune.In general the Music was flawless in this film, and Cyborg's theme when he is realising his full capabilities and influence was incredible.Another scene that was perfect musically was Barry saving Iris from the Car crash - with 'Song to the Siren' playing in the background, contributed to a beautiful sequence and set up a relationship that may be built on in his own movie.Batman felt like Batman again. Alfred was brilliant (that Tea scene with Diana). I enjoyed watching him unite the team with Wonder Woman. Almost as the veterans of the group, fighting next to the relatively inexperienced Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. Leading the strategy as two of the three Trinity members.Aquaman did a great job at showing where Arthur is as a character in this film. How he has cut himself off from Atlantis. This was yet another part of the movie that really cared about the character and it really works well to prelude what happens in the Aquaman movie.Steppenwolf is at least 500x better in this movie. He is brutal and merciless. His goal is to reclaim the mother box's, defeat the earth and regain his place at the side of Darksied in Apokolyps.We get to see him in all his glory. His CG is so much better and his sequence with the Amazons was incredible.The action in general was immense and benefited greatly from being R rated. Every battle sequence had me on the edge of my seat and it was truly amazing to see my favourite comic book characters done so well, and with such respect for the source material and fans. This was, after all made by a fan, and Zak Snyder has managed to make one of the all time great comic book movies. Right up there with the best of Marvel - Infinity War and Endgame. And in the pantheon of great Comic book movies that achieve higher than that mantle of 'Comic book' and live on in the hearts of fans as a Great 'film' and I am truly happy that Zak Snyder was given the opportunity to finish what he started.If HBO Max are keen, and Zak Snyder he chooses to return, I would welcome with open arms the rest of the trilogy that was originally planned for the JL films.Even if it has to break away from Cannon DCEU then so be it. Just make that happen.Thank you Zak Snyder.#restorethesnyderverse is on and I believe in it.", "Not the Justice League We Deserve or Need": "This is better than the theatrical cut, but this is NOT the Justice League we deserve or need.One of the big problems in this is Batman's lack of preparation. Batman has always been known to have contingencies. They decided to revive Superman, who by the way died unnecessarily in BvS as we found out in WW84 that WW can fly, which means she could have saved Superman. Batman, thinking ahead, would have had kryptonite in his belt as a contingency in case they can't get Superman to their side. But Snyder isn't smart enough to move the plot another way. So, he goes for the easy way by making Batman stupidly unprepared.Aside from multiple unnecessary scenes, this movie would have probably been only 2 and a half hours long if not for the slow motion scenes. This had so many slow motion scenes that it makes the film boring. One unnecessary scene is WW in the museum. What was the point of having that scene? It had nothing to do with the plot.The way The Flash runs looks stupid. He is getting far yet his feet moves very slow. And the lightning effects are just too much.Also, for all the thousands of planets that Darkseid had destroyed, he apparently forgot the one where he lost to. This 1 out of 50,000++ is apparently forgettable for him. Even Darkseid has been dumbed down in this film.Atlanteans and Amazons have had their Mother Boxes stolen. They have known for centuries that this is dangerous and can lead to the destruction of Earth. Yet they took no part in the battle. They did nothing and waited for the Earth to be destroyed.If after all these flaws, you still feel that the Snyderverse should be restored. Then, there is no hope for a Justice League that we deserve or need.", "This is the only 4hr movie I am willing to watch twice": "Actions, stories, and editing are all great. You will regret if you don't watch it.. The heroes in this one have more personalities.", "Nothing short of spectacular": "This is without doubt the greatest superhero movie I have ever watched. And quite possibly one of my favourite movies ever also. The only thing holding this movie back from 10 stars...I had to watch it at home. This was built for IMAX.....at least a cinematic experience.", "This was actually good...": "I am by no means an DC Fan. I love the Nolan Batman movies and thats it. I cant even remember the original cut but i think i have seen it. I have to admit i was not interested in the new cut but it was broadcast here on SKY on the same day as the US release. I thought i give it a try but never thought i would watch the whole 4 hours.\nAfter around 1 hour the movie gave me a Lord of The Rings moment as they showed some Flashbacks. Never thought i catch something of that in a Justice League movie.\nThe Flash was really funny and well acted. I cant even remember him from the original cut. All the character got a lot of time on screen and as there wasnt that much solo movies around it was important to give them the screen time they got here.\nI dont even write reviews but with this movie here. I mean it shows how limited a Director is in todays movies. How many movies did we not get because of the studio castrate the directors vision? Its really sad thinking about all the movies we hoped will turn out good and then they where not.\nMaybe this will change a little bit now. I read Snyder didnt take any money for cutting it but wanted total control of the movie. That alone earns my respect.\nGive this movie a try but dont expect too much. I think you will be positively surprised,", "Excellent DC Finally got the love it needed": "This movie is excellent! The fact that when studios listen to their fans and give directors full unlimited rights to their vision really pays off.WB need to get zack working on the follow up to this with zack in the driving seat once again.", "A Great Finish To Unfinished Work": "Really enjoyed the story, action, soundtrack is \ud83d\udd25, all the characters were able to put in the work, and cinematography is on point. *SPOILER ALERT*\n-The cgi moustache does not make an appearance in the Snyderverse-", "An Epic Piece of Cinema; Heartfelt and Richly Satisfying": "I am simply in awe of this film. It so completely fleshes out characters, their backgrounds, their motivations, their fears and their strengths. None of the silliness nor paper-thin plot that was problematic with the theatrical release was present in this film. It was truly character driven and when it was finished, it leaves you sorely wanting more. It's serious but not dark. Instead, it is uplifting and hopeful. There is a cliffhanger ending but not as a tease, really. It's to imply that there is unfinished business for the team of superheroes which binds them together and will strengthen over time with the challenges ahead.\nRay Fisher's Cyborg and Ezra Miller's Flash received so much more screen time - their history and their contributions to the JL. That really strengthened the story and the team. But make no mistake, I believe Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was leagues better in this film. It wonderfully showed that she is a tough and deadly warrior if she needs to be. I enjoyed Jason Momoa's Aquaman so much more in this film as well. He was more brooding, skeptical, serious and less like a college fratboy mugging for inappropriate laughs. This film is epic on the level of The Return of the King and while some will no doubted find fault for a variety of personal reasons, I cannot honestly believe that anyone could saying anything truly derogatory based on the plot, actors, visuals, pacing, or overall linkage with the Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice films.", "Snyder saves Justice League, Justice League saves the earth.... Snyder is the real hero!": "As everyone here have been saying, this is exactly what a true DC fan needed. This is what we get when the director gets complete freedom! It was quite an honorable thing Mr. Snyder did with this movie, in all aspects! Directing... amazing, storytelling... amazing, fight scenes... EPIC!!! Even the scenes used in the first edition, like the WW's bank fight scene, looked 100 times better edited by a true visionary like Mr. Snyder. I am a huge fan of Frank Miller, and seeing his adaptation in live action made the little boy in me the happiest boy in the world!We always have and always will.... Have Faith... in Snyder's vision!", "Snyder saves Justice League, Justice League saves Earth... Snyder is the real HERO!": "Like all the reviews and opinions around the world, finally a DC movie worthy of DC fans. It is not for the faint of heart like the Marvel movies, DC has always been and always should be... dark and broody! Love the cursing, love the killing, love the Snyder Cut! Thank you a million Mr. Snyder for an epic viewing experience! The scenes that were previously used in the first edition looked like a joke, but those same scenes looked epic in this version (like WW's bank fight scene). I am a huge fan of Frank Miller and seeing his adaptation in the big screen is like the little boy in me is living his dreams! You're a true artist and I hope we get to enjoy your vision of DC, Mr. Snyder! We Have Faith In You!...

Really hope there is more from the Snyderverse. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Write for myself": "This film actually more then a twice longer, than a previous version. Story of Flash and Cyborg - fantastic. The black Superman's suit is so epic. And i always love DC more than Marvel.", "The 4 hour is not for nothing": "This is a classic dc movie. A very long one with a lot of slow motion. It the 4 hour make the story of the movie understandable than the earlier one.", "Fixes most fixable things.": "The only thing that keeps me away from setting a 10, is that superman is too Overpowered (he always has been).

The cinema-shorter version can not even compare to Zack Snyder s versio.. 4hrs went like 4 min. This is the version that should have been released , I loved every second of it and it was even better then Avengers end game 10 out of 10", "Way better than the Whedon version!!!": "I went into watching this film with great hope and expectation, and just like Batman, I had faith this would be better than the theatrical release a few years back. In the first 30 minutes you could tell this was WAY better than the original release!! It would be a crime if this the sequels don't expand on this version of Justice League!!", "Everything you wanted and more": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an absolutely amazing continuation of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and is enjoyable for everyone even if they did not enjoy those movies. It's incredibly enjoyable to watch, has amazing heartfelt moments, good humor from the characters, and is absolutely gorgeous to watch. HBO Max splits the movie into chapters so you can easily take breaks if needed. Highly recommend watching", "Solid movie. This is how it should've been": "If you were really let down by Justice League's theatrical release you shouldn't wait on this at all. This is how these group super heroes movies need to go. I'm hoping with the success of this the DC cinematic universe will finally set off", "It is entertaining!": "It is a fun exciting movie. Some moments in the plot maybe silly but it is mean to be entertaining. There is no point to over analyze this movie. I enjoy all 4 hours of it. If I have a chance to see ZSJL in the movie theater, I will go to see it again.", "My opinion": "This is the real JL movie!!!JL 2017? Naaaah.... It's just a trailer for JLSC 2021.2 hours trailer...", "Yessssssssssssssssss!!!!": "So glad this version is now out and Snyder really deserves great praise here! Too many characters that needed more screen time to allow the viewer to really understand (and care - Cyborg and Flash in particular) their struggle or plight. Superman's return is 100x better than the 2017 film and much of the displaced \"humor\" is gone in this updated version. A well-rounded 3rd installment that (in my humble opinion) legitimizes Batman vs Superman and possibly allows for more stories from Snyder... if that happens, it would be great... if not, we got a really great trilogy to watch!", "Trainwreck": "I had my hopes that the Snyder version would make everything that was awful in the first movie and make it better. But no... This is a 4 hour long Trainwreck. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.If they continue with the DC universe they should completely star over with a new director. I mean first Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and now this.", "A Full of Heart Superhero Movie": "Im both marvel and dc guy. But, in this film, i can see a deeper meaning of family, love and being an outcast, and how to overcome it. In this movie, we learn that, time is the very thing that we never get back. So, spend it wisely with your love one, because we never know what the futurr may hold. Cheers for the Cyborg back story. Beautiful, and emotional.", "I would like to give a big congratulations to DC fans around the world": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a great movie. Steppenwolf was a MUCH more interesting villain (and actually looked cool this time around, which is a bonus), Victor Stone became easily the most immersive character, and the build up to Superman's resurrection was much more satisfying. There were a few minor tweaks that I think would make the movie a little better (less slow-motion, don't drag the fight scenes on for too long), but overall the majority of problems with this movie are out of any one person's control and because the DCEU didn't have an established universe of solo films to lead into this. Considering this film had to have multiple, lengthy flashbacks to explain context, it amazes me that this was as good as it was. Well done, Zack.", "Thank you Zach Synder !!!": "This is movie is what the fans deserve. Hopefully enough to spark a sequel !?!?!?!", "The Justice League I waited for": "This was made for the fans by THE fan!! Such a massive improvement on the theatrical release and what I imagined the DC cinematic universe to reveal. The character development is far superior and fleshes out the heroes. The added violence and adult themes adds to the story and the urgency of the heroes coming together. The DC universe isn't the Marvel universe. It doesn't need the comedy. It doesn't need the vibrant colour. It needs grit and heroes that fight for truth, freedom and equality by waging appropriate war on their enemies. Total and utter improvement in the theatrical release. I'm blown away and so grateful this project come to fruition. I can't help but want more from this universe. HBO and Zack Snyder are members of the League in my humble opinion!", "This Movie is Absolute Masterpiece": "4hr makes the movie more perfectAll the characters role are important none can be seen out of placeVfx is in superb quality", "Old Stuff in new cover": "This is the old story of Justice League..There are few new things they added .

The score of this film is phenomenal, all the scenes are amazing.", "FINALLY SOME JUSTICE": "DID JL (2017) & WW1984 (2020) DISAPPOINTED YOU?\nWELL SNYDER CUT (2021) WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR TOLERATING THE OTHER TWOS WITH 2 and 2.5 Hrs EACH AS THE SNYDER CUT IS 4Hrs LONGI'm a huge marvel fan, but I do watch all non-marvel superhero movies too and tbh I even watched JL fdfs which was an utter disappointment. But Zack here has shown that what he was planning to do from the start. I hope WB would select directors like him who could bring DC pride and glory along with breaking BO records.", "The perfect superhero movie!!!": "Nothing is rushed...each and every character was established perfectly and climax is just wow!!! Zack you beautyyyyy.", "Better, still not good": "While an improvement over the original, this just isn't on the level of the marvel franchise. Impressive visuals but the dceu premise is still holding it back, as well a some impressively empty characters and relationships. This movie just does less in 4h than avengers in 2.", "Finally...Justice!": "From the opening scene this film is so much better than the 2017 cinema release. It actually follows on from Batman vs Superman, with a far more compelling introduction which has far reaching consequences. Steppenwolf is actually an imposing character both in appearance and motivation, which makes him a far more imposing and challenging presence to the League.The longer run time means that the characters get far more development over the course of the film. The familiar scenes are put back into there original context, no longer rushed, they can actually breath. There is also a whole host of new material. Each heroic moment, and emotional beat feels earned! The cringe worthy humour of the theatrical release is gone and funny moments are now actually...funny. Each frame of the film is carefully constructed, giving an epic, visual, cinematic asthetic to feast on! The score makes a massive difference too!Both Cyborg and The Flash are no longer token members of the team, but have real presence and impact.As the film progresses there is an actual arch in which the League comes together as a team, each member has a significant part to play and they actually function as a solid unit by the climax.Yes, it's a 4 hour film, but people binge watch TV shows all the time. Even if you don't want to watch it all at once, it's split into chapters, so you could watch it as a mini series, in sections. Enjoy!", "Too good, sad there won't be a sequel": "I was skeptical about this film after the 2017 version. But decided to watch it anyway. I was delighted by it, but left wanting more... I was a little confused with the epilogue... But everything prior to that, it's exciting. It would amazing if there was a continuation to this film... Only think I'd change, is that I saw it at home and not at the movie theater.", "Best superhero movie EVER": "The best super h\u00e9ro movie ever.

Just as bad as the original presentation but made worse with 4:3 aspect ratio.\nThe hype made the film generate a very high expectation, which ended up yielding some disappointments. And 4 hours of film was a big exaggeration", "Strong action and visuals, awful writing.": "I watched this film after it was recommended to me by several friends. They told me it was darker, more violent, and grittier than other movies they had seen in this genre. I'm not the biggest fan of superhero movies but I'll watch them occasionally and I still find them enjoyable. The description my friends provided of this film appealed to me.I certainly don't feel the need to go through superhero movies with a fine toothed comb because these movies are, in my opinion, made first and foremost to be entertaining, and because I'm in no way a qualified critic of film. Simply stated, the writing of this film really does a disservice to what is an overall exciting and visually pleasing film.I didn't expect this movie to have a remarkable script at all but it was actually pretty terrible and often got in the way of enjoying this movie. The cast is quite good and the acting was fine for this type of movie but the writing was frequently cringeworthy and corny. A lot of times a character would make some dramatic statement only to pause and then unnecessarily clarify what they had just said. It seemed like the writers were writing down to the lowest common denominator (maybe this was intentional for maximizing viewers and this is not a problem unique to this film).Additionally, this film is a frequent violator of \"show don't tell,\" opting to have characters make declarations that are hokey and detract from the overall storytelling. In one scene, Wonder Woman says something to a young girl which is both motivational and consistent with what Wonder Woman represents as a character and a symbol. Later on in the film, Wonder Woman has a brief line of dialogue in the midst of a very intense fight in which she says something that sucked me right out of the scene. This particular line, among several others, was nothing more than blatant pandering to today's cultural sentiments and almost made me roll my eyes. Wonder Woman's action scenes were, in my opinion, the best out of any of the heroes in the film and by quite a decent margin. She zips around the screen, defends civilians valiantly, and pummels foes impressively with absolutely brutal feats of strength. All the while she demonstrates humility and a calm, dignified demeanor. We are shown a powerful, refined, intelligent heroine but the dialogue at times cheapens what is otherwise a very well done iteration of Wonder Woman, and the same goes for pretty much every other major character in this film. I'm not bringing this up as an assault on our modern sensibilities or anything like that. I want people of all genders, sexual orientations, races, backgrounds etc. To be able to see themselves represented in all forms of entertainment and culture, including superhero movies, but the writing was so off putting and in your face at times that it cheapened what was already being demonstrated so clearly on the screen.I certainly don't mind watching longer films. If done right, they allow for a degree of storytelling that can't be achieved in the more conventional 90-120 minute film, but the writing in this was so poor that I could not recommend devoting 4 hours to watching this film. It really was that distracting. If you are a superhero movie fanatic, particularly of the DC universe, you are probably going to watch this movie no matter what, and I wouldn't discourage you from doing so. But if you are a more casual fan of superhero movies, I really wouldn't waste your time.", "This is the kind of DC movie that I'd love to watch more of": "Didn't think I'd ever enjoy a 4hrs long movie but I was proven wrong!", "#RestoreTheSnyderverse #ForAutumn": "How is this not canon to the DCEU? This movie has me lost for words...... it deserves more than a 10/10. Can't believe 4 hours wasn't enough I wanted more. We need ZSJL 2,3.

Junkie score is solid. one of the best performance was by Ray Fisher.", "Great movie with a new feel and sound.": "First if you are hesitant about watching a movie that is 4 hours long. Don't be. I see some of the critics have mentioned the length being an issue. It's not, and some will moan for the sake of moaning.That said, this felt like a totally different movie. Alot of footage not seen before, cameos which were not there originally. And scenes that were from the original movie have been enhanced, if not extended.The real shift in tone comes from Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL. The score really shifts the mood in scenes you saw previous, though the scenes are the same, the narrative feels somewhat different, without the cheesiness set in the previous movie.Dropped are the scenes where superman races the flash and the flash running people out in the final battle.A massive triumph with Cyborg. To say his story wasn't the heart of this film, would be a lie. Fisher is brilliant.The flash also gets additional scenes and the focus on his speed and how fast he can go is a really nice change.Dropped also is that awful scene with the lasso and aqauman sharing the love.Steppenwolf is strangely much more compelling and more intimidating. Where as originally he felt like a filler.Overall, I wish this could have been the original movie. The Joss Whedon view has alot to answer for from the terrible score to the awful amount of cringe moments. Those moments take away from the characters and the arc of the story.So please give it a chance, give it a whirl. Make sure you give yourself a break after part 4 as it's the long stretch after that.This movie needs to be made canon and really wouldn't affect what's out there now.Thankyou Zack", "Just...Wow": "When the calls for the Snyder Cut first started, I was not excited. How could some edits make the movie *that* much better. Holy cow was I wrong. Yeah, it's ridiculously long, and if it had come out in 2017 it would have needed to be two installments, but such a better movie. Character development was off the charts compared to the old one. Cyborg and The Flash were so much more important to the story. The stakes in the final battle were so much higher and felt more genuine than in the previous film. I truely hope this reignites the franchise and the story can continue.", "The Best h\u00e9roes movie": "Amazing.

Love the scene with Superman and the voice of his two fathers (both JOR-EL and Jonathan Kent). Wonder woman is a badass warrior. The post-apocalyptic ending scene was great.The opening scene is majestic!! The old GODs were great. We got to see Hal Jordan and future ATOM. Loved the epic music of Junkie XL.

Having said that, it is the greatest comic book movie ever made. 4 hours flies by. When it ended, I wanted more. It's emotional, epic, funny, and with all of Zack's greatest tricks. No one visually tells a story like him. It's truly remarkable. The cast all knock it out of the park. The last hour and a half of the movie will leave you in tears at the sheet beauty of what's on the screen. The cinematography, color, shot choices, choreography of the battle sequences, and music are all unmatched. I haven't stopped thinking about it. Why WB wants to move away from this is just baffling and infuriating. We simply don't get movies like this.

I feel like there was a lot of stuff that was added that didn't really enhance the story, but was rather just fan service for those who have been screaming about this movie online. A lot of the stuff in this movie was unnecessary, the constant slow motion made action scenes drag on, and when they wanted to use slow motion for more impacted emotion, it wasn't as powerful. Another thing that was unnecessary was the R rating. There was a ton of added CGI blood that looked kinda off, and was just there to be edgy and give it an R rating. Of course there was plenty of things that were made better from the theatrical cut, and overall the movie was bearable and I would say that it is certainly mediocre.", "The characters we have loved shown justice at last": "Everything about this movie was spectacular (minus a few scenes that probably could have been left out). The character development was very well done, I felt a connection to all of them, including the villain! Junkie XL's score played the exact right tunes at the perfect time, creating scenes where real emotion could be felt. The story was explained significantly better, and the tone neither added to the darkness, nor took away the darkness of Zacks previous DC movies. Rather it took the darkness and added more hope to it. Great, explosive film that creates an epic experience.", "JUSTICE SERVED TO JUSTICE LEAGUE": "Glad I never watched Justice League 2017.Snyder was so sure of himself, he let go of his fees as well.

When Man of steel came out I was surprised how great it was. Batman v superman was a mixed reaction but my opinion was it was good movie. When JL came out I walked out thinking it was terrible with only 2 or 3 good moments.\nThe 2021 JL was to me a masterpiece. From minute 1 to the end of a 4 hour story I did not want it to end. Every aspect of the movie was great. Each character gets there time to shine and story arcs are fleshed out.\nMy only nit picking is the slow motion scenes a bit to much. Apart from that a well executed film.\nMy only gripe is WB has no plans to have Snyder do anymore movies and this version opens up to sequels.\nSo if your up for some great action. Surprise cameos and awesome special effects and a great story telling then this a great movie to watch.", "Uhhhh": "Can someone tell me what 10 year old made this film?

Almost every characters story arc is told different, even the villains and it felt like it was all flushed out better. There are many scenes in the 2017 version which baffled me a little... like why that arrow(amazonians), how did they get into the ship(resurection) etc... and every detail is flushed out and told as a cohesive story. Some of the forced jokes taken out and replaced with more tone appropriate jokes to the movie. The action was definitely a whole lot better, felt like some of the best action sequences which were in the snyder cut was definitely worth every minute. There's a few twists, different ending and some well appreciated surprises which didn't make the marketing/trailers. All in all... I don't think any one person is responsible for the 2017 trainwreck but this one is definitely a huge improvement.Only negative I have for this movie is although the epilogue were amazing scenes on their own.. they felt a little out of place and probably could've been weaved into the movie rather than just placed at the end which felt like it was disconnected from the flow a little.Overall: Definitely worth the watch, it is length but worth it..

This was the film we were all waiting for and the film we wanted to see when we heard justice league was first coming out.

The music is all over the place and doesn't fit at all.\nThe flash is more annoying than before and hardly does anything.\nThis might be the worst of all the batman's and that's hard to say cos Batman is my favourite.\nAll he does in this movie is crash his vehicles and shoot things. In the final fight he disappears for like 20 minutes..oh and he can block superman's heat vision now...\nBen affleck is a wooden plank\nGal gadot is a wooden plank of emotion\nAquaman is fine I guess but noone has any chemistry\nDarkseid doesn't do anything all the scenes from the trailers are pretty much all of the darkseid scenes.

If take any one of them out they couldn't save the world. The Story arc pretty good. The movie was long bcoz of each character needed that time develop. Hopefully Snyder will give us more JL movies.", "A beautifully crafted superhero movie that somehow missed a piece.": "Don't get me wrong as I agree that Zack Snyder's Justice League is far better than what happened in 2017. Usually hype kind of kills a movie but that is not the case with JL. The movie is beautifully made with so many iconic cinematic shots and is supported by a marvelous score. Heroes look great, villains look great, their CGI looks great and the involvement of Darkseid is much more appealing. But what this movie lacks is the emotional connection we create with characters.\nIn BVS, my all time favorite comic movie (except The Dark Knight because it is more grounded to be addressed as a CBM movie) I created a powerful connection with Batman, Bruce Wayne, Superman and Clarke Kent.It made me sit through the movie with an understanding of the characters and what drives them to their ultimate goals. But somehow Justice League wasnt successful in making me understanding the characters and their ambitions as a whole. I didnt perform an emotional bond with any of the characters including Batman who in fact my favorite hero.\nAnd furthermore Darkseid couldnt scare me as much as I thought he would. It made me think whether the potential of gloomy darkness in the beginning is wasted.\nBut overall, the mood was clearly present throughout the movie. From the beginning there was the fret of coming danger around the corner and which always hangs above the air. The opening scene: (No Spoilers because it was in BVS) the death of superman was obviously heartbreaking as Snyder revisits the scene with more cinematic approach.\nSo overall Zack Snyder's Justice League is a must see superhero movie to anyone who is in love with the genre. The comedy was not lame but entertaining. And the movie as a whole gave the audience the heroic epic finale they expected. Zack Snyder once again proved that there is no other who could approach a CBM like him. But frankly if he ever had chance to #RestoretheSnyderverse I highly hope he will concentrate more on the feel and bond the characters make with the audience as he exactly did in BVS. For anyone who seeks advice whether to or not to watch the movie I say go for it! It deserves every minute of your valuable time. Hats off Snyder!!", "Dream comes true": "JLSC is the ultimate comic based movie i have seen so far.", "Worth every minute of 4 hours": "Watching it makes you realise what DCEU could've been.

Why not go back to where he left them in the first place?Pros: overall it's a much better movie than Josstice League, humour is better, shots are better, no pervy booty shots of Diana. Flash is muuuuuch better, he probably was my favorite change between the too but he is still too dorky. He included Atom in a very nice way.Cons: it's unnecessary long, there was so much damn slow motion I wanted to speed the movie up. Music was awkward and awful imo. The movie was not exciting, fight scenes were better but not good. Too many stupid choices like Diana blasting dudes and killing people in front of children with no problem but then blows up a building to kill one person which I'm sure left some kids with concussions and or deaf. Plus some cops definitely got killed. Slow motion! So much I have to say it twice! Superman's scream in the beginning echoed that much? Wouldn't people go deaf? Mother boxes covering the planet in light would leave people blind. Lex and Deathstroke were a waste. Joker, the injustice joker was useless as well and just terrible scene overall, the entire Knightmare was awful.I'm glad Snyder got his vision but this is the last of it for me, I don't want to see another DC movie from him ever again.Does Snyder know that Superman isn't always angry?\nBatman is a strategist not a person who operates on \"faith\" and says stuff like \"we gotta come together!!!\"\nSnyder just proved that he doesn't get these characters.\nOh and that stuuuupid goat singing everytime we see wonder woman.", "a true and great, Snyder film": "Horrible scene of Iris being thrown out of the car, instead of hitting but hardware in front ...But the movie: Very Snyder Omg !! Many epic scenes that took too long, a color filter that makes it more boring, and very slow motion. Really much.\nApart from these mannerisms of Snyder ... Plot well tied despite being long, better performances, including Superman that I did not like the Cavil version, cool appearances to leave us wanting more, (despite the first one by Martian Manhunter being quite silly and without purpose.)\nThe director's own humor, well done but not much, and mainly it doesn't have that tone change that the cinema version has with the VHL.\nWw action scenes just fantastic, and the others too, of course.\nVillain much better than the first film, and Uxas sensational. And also the mythology of the gods and Apocolips is epic.\nI like \"I want more!\"\nVery cool movie.\nApart from these little points (whoever is a fan of snyder will love it, and who doesn't like it will speak ill ..) it's cool, and makes the first one look like a parody.\nAnd without a doubt the best hit of the film, was to recover the joker of the excellent actor Jared leto, who was bad in a general consensus previously ... It's sensational and the distorted future in Batman's dream is simply sensational too.\nReference to the deadly joke of the dark knight, Injustice, Flashpoint, among others.\nGrade 7 out of 10", "It truly is a crime!!": "That this cut wasn't shown on the big screen.

Story was awesome. pacing was great. Well done to all. Thank you!", "Zack Snyder's Justice League is True Cinema": "A while back, Martin Scorsese made headlines when he stated that most superhero movies were not truly cinema as he understood it. He took a lot of heat for that statement, and later clarified what he meant:\"Many of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures. What's not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes. They are sequels in name but they are remakes in spirit, and everything in them is officially sanctioned because it can't really be any other way. That's the nature of modern film franchises: market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they're ready for consumption.\"More or less, I agree with Scorsese. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE superhero movies, both Marvel and DC. I will always go to the opening night showings of these movies and get excited. I've been that kind of die-hard lover of comic book superheroes my whole life. And whether or not those movies are considered \"cinema\", I'll enjoy them either way.But let me put aside my fan-boy persona for a moment and say something as objectively as I possibly can: Zack Snyder's Justice League is not just a good superhero movie, it is true cinema.The story behind the #snydercut of Justice League has been discussed a lot lately. Warner Bros lost faith in Zack Snyder to deliver what they wanted, so when he suffered a family tragedy, the studio stepped in and brought Joss Wheadon on to rewrite and reedit the film. The 2017 theatrical release we got of the now infamous \"Josstice\" League was exactly what Scorsese lamented about superhero movies. It was cookie-cutter, emotionless, and safe... Except for the fact that it was a disaster.Warner Bros wanted a carbon copy of Marvel's formulaic movie franchise. But now having seen Zack Snyder's Justice League, it is clear that Snyder's vision for Justice League was diametrically opposite of Marvel's formula. The Snyder Cut has less in common with superhero team-ups like Avengers or X-men, and more in common with epics like The Lord of the Rings. Rather than being treated like a climactic event in a franchise, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a well-crafted, artful ensemble film that cares more about character and world building than it does about basically anything else. Yes, there is a plot which is essentially the same outline as the 2017 film, but that plot is now driven by well-rounded characters operating in a vividly fleshed out world as opposed to being driven by a studio-mandated 2 hour runtime.Every character in the film gets a fully realized character arc - and not just the 6 members of the league, but Steppenwolf and Silas Stone (Cyborg's father) also get their chance to pull on the heartstrings. Characters that were reduced to glorified cameos in the 2017 cut like the Amazons, Alfred, Mera and Lois Lane are all developed into competent, respectable characters with agency.Speaking of competent characters with agency, there is a blatantly clear distinction between the 2017 Wheadon cut and Zack Snyder's Justice League. It is clear, now having seen the original cut of the movie, that almost every character who was removed or had a significantly reduced role in the theatrical cut was a woman or a person of color. Female characters like the Amazons and Mera demonstrate competency, agency, and leadership rather than being treated like eye-candy. Lois is given a full emotional arc. Iris West, Ryan Choi, and Martian Manhunter are all characters of color who are tragically missing from the theatrical cut.But the people who are most grievously affected by these choices are Cyborg and his father, Silas Stone. Cyborg truly is the heart of the film, and seeing the incredibly emotional depiction of his character and his relationship with his father is all the more tragic when compared to what we saw in 2017. Only one scene with Cyborg was the same between the two movies, and the decision to reduce his role from being the heart of the film to being the most overlooked member of the Justice League is both deliberate and offensive. Cyborg actor Ray Fisher has claimed these decisions were deliberate, and while I can't speak into the intentions of what happened, Zack Snyder's Justice League stands as cinematic proof that, whether these decisions were deliberate or unintentional, they were decisions nonetheless.But that heart of Zack Snyder's Justice League is on full display, and is perhaps the greatest strength of the film. In a film dedicated to Snyder's late daughter, every main character is driven by their relationship with their parents or parent figures. Chief among these is Cyborg's resentment of his father, Aquaman's denial of his heritage, and Flash's desire to free his father. These are mirrored by Steppenwolf's surprisingly empathetic character beats, as a being in exile and debt to his lord and master, Darkseid. The conditional nature of Steppenwolf's relationship with Darkseid starkly contrasts Superman's father Jor-El's call from beyond the grave to love the people of earth just as he loved his only son.The film also has themes of teamwork, hope, and faith. Zack Snyder's Justice League actually sees the league progress and learn how to act as a team, with Batman serving the role as team leader. Ben Affleck, who is still my all-time favorite live-action Batman, portrays growth in Batman's character from Batman v Superman. Before, Batman was a dark, brooding loner who was slipping in his moral code. But after his encounter with Superman and witnessing Superman's self-sacrifice, Batman is now admittedly a leader who is driven as much by guilt as he is by faith. It is incredibly complex character building, and seeing a Batman who operates on faith is something that I have only seen portrayed in a few of the best renditions of the character - Batman: The Animated Series and Tom King's recent Batman comic book run.But the final theme of the film again is centered on Ray Fisher's Cyborg, who at first resents his father for turning him into Cyborg. His arc is focused on discovering his purpose, and learning why he was given the gifts he was. Though Silas Stone acknowledges that the world is broken, and everything in the world breaks, the film makes a strong case that even when we are broken, we are not alone.Zack Snyder's Justice League may be long, but it is a masterful work of art that demands repeat viewings. It must not only be seen, but it must be internalized and experienced. It will challenge, but it will also inspire. Zack Snyder's Justice League is true cinema, and I for one am ready for more. It's time to #RestoreTheSnyderverseP.S.Without going into spoilers, it must be said that the Flash's role in the final battle was awe-inspiring and iconic. Why they decided to trade that for Flash saving the random Russian family is mind-numbing. Heck, why they changed ANYTHING to what they did in the 2017 version is beyond me, but at this point, I am just so grateful we got to experience this film.", "Fantastic Superhero Flick!": "Have watched the original JL released and enjoyed it.\nWith this release it was a breath of fresh air, the action, build up, characters were on point and made this JL the movie it should have been.\nDefinitely recommended!", "Exactly what was needed.": "Always felt the DC universe felt lacking when compared to marvel until watching this masterpiece.

Every scene builds on top of the previous one, ensuring a sustained intensity throughout the movie. The character development is obviously the most noticeable improvement here, especially for Cyborg. You could almost feel Stone's journey, from a broken man robbed away of a promising future, struggling to accept the fact of being a half-man half-robot, to proudly embracing who he is and make peace with his past. Barry Allen took center stage too, not just being a comical character throwing some cheap jokes like the one we see in the 2017 disgrace of a movie (shame on you Whedon!). We also finally get to see a lot of his other powers here. And spoiler alert, these two are gonna play an important part in the story!Yes, the CGI could admittedly be better in some parts, but Black Panther which was also a great movie, with great plot, amazing actors and character developments did itself have a rather bad CGI (yup, i'm talking about you the crappy tunnel fight scene!). So i think it's a bit unfair to judge this movie solely on its CGI.In the end, this movie is DEFINITELY WORTH YOUR TIME, and even if a sequel is not gonna happen (which would be a shame), this movie has ended the DCEU (at least as we know it) on a high note. But hey, the fans made this movie happen in the first place, perhaps the fans will also make a sequel happening too.

There wher so manny epilogs that i did something that i hadnt done for the tnire movie up until then, i looked over to see how long it was left.I would have enjoyed a couple of origin films about cyborg and flash but it wasnt something that hinderd my enjoyment of the movie.

This event movie has so many layers that justify the 4 hour run time ( which go by in no time ). It has fully fleshed out themes & characters that allows you to fully immerse yourself in Zack's world. Towards the end of the movie I was looking at the time & was thinking that \"this can't end now, there's too much story left to tell\". I really hope that this is the starting point for the continuation of the DCEU that Zack started.

I actually cared for Cyborg in this film and finally understood the antagonists motivations. Snyder redeemed himself with this one. My only minor gribe with the film is there are a few scenes.that maybe could have been cut to shorten the film. Like the akward singing to Aquaman and we didn't need to see Louis mope like 5 times in the film. I think maybe twice was enough for the audience to get the point that she really misses Clark. Other than that it was a truly wonderful film. 9.5.", "Worst movie I've ever seen": "I just finished this film on hbo It took 3 different occasions to get all the way through this garbage I actually feel asleep watching every time I have wasted plenty of time in my life staring at a tv but never have I ever regretted 4 hours wasted like this.

Growing up, watching Justice League animated on TV , all I ever wanted was to see those characters in a live action. That dream was ruined with the 2017 Justice League. But Zack has made me hopeful again.After watching Zack Snyder's Justice League, it is clear that 2017's theatrical cut was butchered by Joss Whedon. Steppenwolf was ruined by fixating over motherboxes, calling them \"mother\" for some reason. There was no influence of darkseid in the theatrical cut. \"Come together\" was a horrible theme for Justice League. Flash landing on Wonder Woman's breasts to add distasteful humor. Killing Cyborg's character arc completely. Showing Flash as an unimportant nerfed metahuman who needed a pep talk from Batman to save two humans from aliens. These are some of the things I hated from the theatrical cut. I could go on and on about these, but the point remains the same : Zack fixed them all.The music was better (with the exception of weird throat singing during every WW encounter), Cyborg was the heart of the movie as promised, Batman showed himself as a leader, the League was not completely reliant on Superman to do their dirty work, Flash and Cyborg had ACTUAL role to play this time, all the characters had back stories and important character arcs, a freaking cameo to set up the future movies (which seems unlikely , thanks to WB).

I found myself in awe and drawn to the story. It has made me desperately anticipating a part 2. I've always like DC and I feel the Marvel universe was dominating!

This is by far Zack Snyder's best film to date and this Epic Movie leaves you wanting to see more of what is to come. We must Restore the Snyderverse. Junkie XLs movie score is as epic as one could envision and all the notes hit the right chord. I really don't know what to say. Each character gets thier time to shine and it shows what character development can do for a movie and the four hours doesn't feel like it at all. Great pacing.", "Justice League 2 MUST happen now! (with Ben and Henry)": "This IS the real Justice League and it doesn't disappoint. I thought the difference would be subtle it isn't subtle. Even though the high level story is the same it is a new movie and it doesn't feel like you're watching the theatrical release. You really don't know what's going to happen. Zack Snyder eliminated the cheesy graphics and dialogue. He then replaces it with his vision which properly connects all the DC movies (even the ones made after Justice League). This soundtrack is appropriate. The computer graphics match the DC universe. It is amazing. Now we have to put pressure on WB to deliver JL2 and bring back the actors. It has to have Affleck and Henry Cavill. The line change had to be Jared Leto. He really doesn't make a good joker IMO. I know we can't have Heath Ledger back but surely they can find a better joker. Well done Mr. Snyder and thank you WB for doing this. All is well in the DC universe again!", "Finally fulfilled what alot of dc fans have been waiting for.": "Each character of the original seven leaguers get screen time and are well developed throughout this movie. Cyborg feels like a main character vs barley being apart of the movie the first time. Barrys powers are explored more and each character has good fight and struggle with steppen folf making them all seem way more powerful then the last movie. The pacing of this was far beyond the last movie. This movie is on par with the DCAMU films.", "What were Warner Bros thinking?": "I've watched this version of the movie twice since release. You have to question what Warner executives were thinking when they cancelled this and bright in Whedon to finish the film.This version thankfully cancels out the memories of the 2017 version. We now have a film that develops proper story arcs for the main characters and villain. It continues on the themes that Snyder established with Man of Steel and BvS. We get a far more interesting story than simply - \"here some demons that feed off fear but are scared of the sound of police sirens\". The mythology of old and new gods is established and explored in more detail.The soundtrack by Junkie XL is wonderful. The film sounds like it's part of the same series of films as MoS and BvS. As much as I love Danny Elfman his rehashes of old Batman and Superman themes just doesn't work in this era.This is a wonderful comic book adaptation which everyone should make time to watch.", "Restore the Snyder universe": "Masterpiece, why they didn't show this one first, that's how it was supposed to be from the beginning", "THANK YOU!": "You have probably heard this now a hundred, thousand times! But thank you, from all of us, for breathing life back into the DC Universe. I hope people who haven't seen this, know its not just a touch up, it's a recreation of what should of been. Got rid of the corny things and added fair screen time for each character. A film the fans deserved and the characters themselves. The casting was perfect, it's only fair they get a perfect film. Even if you don't make another DC film this one left us all on a much higher note, than whatever the original was supposed to be. Superman and the Justice league have been around for decades and deserved a lot more than second place to the avengers films. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!", "Such a good movie, wow!": "This just goes to show how easily a time limit and bad editing can ruin a movie. The success of this film is bittersweet for me. I can only imagine what could've been possible if Zack Snyder finished his original movie.", "Great, but not incredible.": "I thoroughly enjoyed this version much more than the first one. A longer runtime allowed for more character development which was a huge improvement. Still, not everyone gets a \"re-do\" and the whole super hero-team-up theme is getting a bit tired.

However, directing and way how some scenes are made is a masterpice (think GOT last season, ruined by poor script).

The whole Directors cut rewrite put our movie night group of 8 to sleep and in our opinion they could've utilized at least two hours four better content. Overrated Batman vs Superman 2? Zack Snyder extended cut that none of us have any plans to ever watching again! Besides the fact that DCEU Flash is A horrible act that is painful to watch and obnoxious as hell. Not to mention Ezra's running style makes him look goofy and uncoordinated for a superhero. But I guess that doesn't really matter in a disappointment like this. Especially after all the build up and buzz going around about Zack Snyder Justice League cut being so epic, but we were all epically not impressed with this movie and it probably because Snyder just isn't that good. #overrated, #DCFlop, #Snorefest", "Exelente pelicula 100% recomendada": "Exelente pelicula, me encanto\nEs la verdadera liga de la justicia.. fiel a los comics y representada por los mejores actores", "Filled with atmosphere and passion": "The highlight of the other well made scenes overshadow the more questionable sequences but overall consistent and filled to the brim with atmosphere.", "Finally the Justice League Feeling in Live Action": "As most DC fans can agree The Justice Leauge is very special to our hearts. Justice League stories always give off a feeling of familiarity and warmth that you can't get anywhere else in Comicbook Media. Justice Leauge is close to the heart because they are a family, not a team. To think that this has never been emulated in Live Action is insane! But finally, it has. Snyder finally delivered that Justice League feeling us fan have craved to see on the big screen since we where kids. Watching this felt no different than reading Grant Morrisons JLA run or watching a season of Bruce Timms Justice League. You go into this movie and instantly have that sense of familuarity and recognition that this is THE JUSTICE LEAUGE, and you know it. Where Joss Wheadons JL felt cold, distant, awkward and not even close to emulating what makes the JL the JL. Snyder finally put the pieces together to bring it to us like he knew what he was doing all along. This truly does feel like another classic Justice League story.

The first hour was all storytelling.", "Worth the wait...": "With all the hype going around, it seemed unfair to not have reviewed one of the most anticipated movies of the year, so here I am.The Snyder Cut (2021) is a 4 hrs long extended version of its predecessor Justice League (2017). After Zack Snyder stepped down from his own film back in 2017, due to the tragic death of his daughter, WB entrusted the film to Joss Whedon, who previously directed superhero films like The Avengers (2012). However Wheddon's version of the film was far from Snyder's vision, which soon gave rise to a massive fan movement #releasethesnydercut . Its all history now that Zack Snyder has taken up the director's chair one more time, and released what is probably the greatest DC superhero film by far.Goes without saying, if a film is extended by double its initial runtime, the plot no longer remains unchanged. After Superman's death, Bruce Wayne assembles a team of superheroes whose aim is to protect three powerful artifacts, known as the Mother Boxes, from falling in to the wrong hands of planet destroyer Darkseid. Snyder gave the new heroes their backstories which the initial film lacked, one of the reasons why fans couldn't connect closely to the hillarious speedster, The Flash, or the metahuman, Cyborg.Zack Snyder's Justice League was an absolute showstopper and definitely worth the wait. I rated Justice League (2017) 2 stars, but this deserves wayyy better.", "leaves you asking for more": "Very good, better than expected, and leaves one asking for more, those 4 hours fly by, and although there may be moments when the solemnity of the scene lasts longer than usual, it allows the characters to feel more. Big difference between a 2017 one to that of snyder. Although many shots are the same, the way he tells and captures his vision makes it a different film, much better, by far.", "Worthy of a sequel": "This film should be the reason for the continuous overflow the DCEU.", "This movie is everything a DC fan wanted": "Like a movie, it has flaws but for those who like DC ...", "The movie fans deserve": "Worth the wait....

Let's be honest the bar wasn't set to high. But even now it is pretty meh movie, not good, not but, just is. And I'm judging movie only, without context. And looking at it as a movie... well i haven't felt anything. Maybe except cringe couple of time. And I do wanna feel all the feels while watching Justice League! I love them, I watched animation way to many time and Batman is my hero. But while watching this movie I haven't feel anything, no joy, no excitement, no tension, nothing. It was mediocre at best.", "A completely different movie!": "Like most fans, I was very disappointed with the original cut. The story felt very disjointed and never quite connected with the audience; as if something were missing.Well, as it turnsout, there was. A good forty minutes of important story telling and character development. This version was so much more emotional than the original cut, that it's almost unbelievable! Putting those minutes back, even made some of the acting choices, that were made, make a lot more sense.After watching this version, I can't help but wonder, how the studio could have settled for anything less. Now, I understand, that getting people, to sit through a four hour movie in a theater, would be very difficult; but I think it would have been much better, to release this movie in two parts or split it into a four part mini series, for one of the streaming channels. Because I can honestly say, after watching this new cut, I went not liking this film, to actually loving it. This version literally gave me goosebumps.Now, I admit, I could have done without the last five minutes or so. I felt that it really, added nothing to this story and made it drag on a little too long, but other than that, this version is nearly flawless.

I'd watch Zack Snyder's version and think, \"This is great, but I'm sad that such and such a thing isn't in it anymore.\"Not the case. Every single part of the 2017 cut that I liked is here. And everything that I hated is gone. The broken clock was never right.This movie is a massive improvement on the 2017 cut, to the extent that I have to wonder if something weird happened behind the scenes, something that the public will never know about. Every single aspect of the film is improved.Scratch that - because improving on the 2017 cut is not hard. Every single aspect of this film is GOOD. Many aspects are great. Overall, this is a fantastic movie. I don't usually post reviews on here, but dang. I think this one deserves all the praise it can get.", "Superhero masterpiece": "The best superhero movie I've ever seen. Ben Affleck's Batman is cool as hell.

Sheer expression of power and strength! Little girls today get to grow up with these women on screen and I am so psyched!Also, can we talk about how much of Cyborg they actually erased from the theatrical release?! No wonder the movie didn't make sense and NO WONDER Ray Fisher was pissed! They butchered his character, a pivotal character to making the story work! What were they thinking??And how adorable Henry Cavill makes Superman look? Like a powerful god, but also the baby you wanna wrap in a blanket and keep safe! Exploring his relationship with Lois was such a wonderfully soft sequence.I loved what they did with the Flash and setting up Flashpoint though. How did they miss that one in the theatrical release? I mean you have a film lined up, how do you miss it? That's just sloppy and unprofessional.And finally,\nMe: Aww! Lois is pregnant. Clark's gonna be a dad!\nAlso me: *has Injustice flashbacks* I really hope they'd continue this one. With the multiverse set up and may be find a way to get this film a theatrical release. It so deserves it!", "A masterpiece worth living inside!": "This kind of cinematic experience can be experienced only once. Why we didn't experience it in the first go is sad to imagine. This should have been lived in 3D in cinemas. Snyder's vision is what DC needs to build DCEU. Really hope that they decide to make the second part and let us comic fans live the entire movie in cinema! Just amazing. Not one scene is a waste and everything is so well explained. It was a DC fan's epitome of dream. Everything was there. The dialogues, the character chemistry and the darkness that defines DC... Mr. Snyder did justice to every single character and we connected personally to each one of them. Even the villains managed to bring out the best of our emotions.\nThe four hours left us biting our nails over what's about to happen. And even after that, there's so much more that we need to see and explore.

DC is all about the characters with dark and gritty storylines not like marvel where its a bit more light hearted, so this puts the DCVerse right back on track.

All the characters are way more developed, action sequences are way better and enjoyable - it feels like everyone JL member is fighting as a team and is contributing to the cause, the comedy bits don't feel cringy, CGI is much better, Steppenwolf isn't just a bad guy- he has reasons and motivations to do what he is doing. I can go on...Granted that the length of the movie was almost double of the theatrical cut but most the Snyer's cut could be fitted in 2 and half hours.The monologue is the best part.

Lines are super cheesy, felt like I've seen this movie before with the exact events, not sure where. Does not bring much to the table, although cheers on the costumes and the special effects. Marvel set the bar way to high for any other universe to step up right now. Just feel like cyborg is a copy of Tony, WW of cap and so forth.

This film had the opposite effect. This is the film that Snyder deserved to have had shown originally and not the Frankenstein's monster of a film that was made in it's place. Every character has their own time to shine, specifically Ray Fisher's Cyborg and Ezra Miller's Flash. Now, Steppenwolf actually feels like an actual character now with his own motivations behind his actions. Batman is finally a Badass again and Superman no longer has a wierdly distorted face. Hopefully WB realise the potential of Zack's Vision and extend it, because seeing that Knightmare sequence and what could come afterwards only left me wanting more from this series.", "Osam": "Hvfjftidystididtudyiduduyaydtisixkhudhxidyudutdiydiy", "Timeless masterpiece": "Words fall short to describe it. It's basically a piece of brilliant art. Snyder has his unique views and portrayed it beautifully. Not always the world see eye to eye with his views but that has always been like this for legends.Watched both the theatrical cut and the Snyder's cut. It's at least 80% different from the theatrical cut.The previous one didn't explain what are these para demons and how they were created, what exactly is Steppenwolf's agenda, how did Dianna know so much about steppenwolf and many more other points. But this movie describes everything and answers all the questions.There's plenty humour if you watch it mindfully. It's not a comedy movie so don't expect the heroes to sit at a bar or cafe or round table and joke around. The world is in danger and they have little time and resources to save it. There will be pain and darkness when a movie shows love and loss and human emotions.So if you prefer a light movie that has simple storyline with no depth and bright sunny days to relax mindlessly then I suggest against watching it. A lot of work goes into each and every frame and not every movie is a fairytale. There are other movies in that specific genre.And if you do decide to watch it then don't keep a notion of how a superhero movie should be. As this movie is simply brilliant in every aspect. So honour it that way without comparing it with anything else.", "Masterpiece by Zack": "Movie was perfectly directed. Specially the visual effects and sound during under-water scenes.

This movies does not leave you hanging and asking for more at the end. It shows you not only what is happening but why it is happening. When the end credits roll, you feel happy and satisfied. A true gift from Zack Snyder to DC fans.\nBest parts about the movie: Awesome cameos from a future justice league member, superman in an awesome suit, better backstories for victor and flash, glimpse of apokolips, power upgrades for all of the heroes and a lot more.\nSteppenwolf has back story, a motive and you can finally understand why he is doing what he is doing.

He truly is incredible.\nBen Affleck continues to be the best on-screen Batman ever.\nAqua Man playing Jason Mamoa was awesome. He's perfect for that role.\nI cannot wait until my daughter is old enough to see Wonder Woman and the Amazon's. Such a great display of how strong women can be without the \"men are toxic\" mindset.

That is really good for a movie, and it is 0.5 higher than endgame.

Gal Gadot is wonderful actress and Jason Momoa a perfect grumpy hero... Or they could be if somebody could do a proper screenplay and direct them skillfully.C'mon even Marvel succeded using clich\u00e9s and terrible jokes and still make decent and interesting movies...

The selection of the song is really beautiful... this is what I like the most, it's really a masterpiece after all.\nThe superheroes introduction at the beginning was filled with good and iconic scenes from each superhero.

This was a beautiful story rich in the why of it all. Ensemble banter and CGI battles only go so far when you hack 80% of the character development. I've seen those movies, I want something different, and this is it. Honestly I watched Man of Steel immediately after this movie and it only made me appreciate that movie more.

So much could have been shown starting from the point where first Justice League left/ended. Seriously you can sleep an hour and still be on the same scene. Why so slow. Marvels have build up a storyline with a villian (Thanos) that fails 99% of the heroes. DC has only 3 characters, The Best \" Superman\", Second best \"Batman\", Third \"Wonder Women\". You need to keep atleast the respect of Superman. You cant humiliate a Super Hero character. Pathetic.

This version of Justice League however does outshine the previous one, which was a disaster in its own right.A lot of the added scenes and editing make the story more coherent and fleshed out, but this doesn't change the fact there is just too much explanation or backstory needed to introduce 3 whole characters who didn't have their own movie yet (when Justice League originally released).The acting is great, the dialogue is cheesy at times, the soundtrack and story could be better. All in all Justice League is a mediocre film and too long, that has it's moments. However if DC (or probably WB) actually took the time to first introduce every single (hero) character with it's own movie and then started working towards a Justice League, it could be one hell of a movie. For now the whole plot is rushed and it shows. DC deserves better.Oh and thank God for no CGI mouth Cavill, because that is stuff from nightmares.", "Better than the original right from the beginning!": "This is how you make a movie.

To that end, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. 4 hours went by quickly and everything flowed smoothly. Characters were well developed and the action scenes held their epic-ness. A few things a I noticed:1. Wonder Woman - seeing wonder woman here makes me remember how awesome wonder woman really is. Great action sequences with her.2. Cyborg - His character arc was well developed and made the plot more cohesive. It was a real shame how much was cut from the original.3. Batman - this is the Batman we all know and love. No comical stuff. Ben Affleck does a great job.4. Steppenwolf - in the original movie, his character was not well developed. He just looked like a generic monster attacking earth. In this movie we understand his motives more clearly. As the main villain, it made the movie much more engaging. Plus his look was much more menacing.Now that we got the Justice League we wanted, it makes us wonder how cool Justice League part 2 would have been.

No reasonable story, things just start happening from nothing, and in general the stories / scenes / dialogues are very boring... Full of clishes, no surprises...

Totally summing up (negatively) to the bad stories, events, dialogue...Maybe is the pandemic effect, or just fanboys, or even the very low expectations regarding the first movie... one (or all?!) of the reasons behind these 9/10 overrated reviews...", "What a massive surprise.": "Unlike the dreadful OTHER version this is a masterpiece of Zack's brilliant mind.", "Better than 2017 Justice league": "While the 4 hour watch time may seem threatening to some, it's a good watch.However some issues I have with the film while minor still exist; Due to this being the film that was meant to be out in 2017 it doesn't account for the events in aquaman so Arthur still has his mother's trident and hasn't mastered ocean combat so he isn't at full power like at the end of Aquaman.\nAlso the final battle against Stephenwolf felt anti-climatic for the 3 hour 45 minute buildup but is satisfying to see him destroyed by a 3 combo takedown from the justice league at least.Overall a good watch that's only issues are due to the unfortunate time it was brought out.", "Best!!": "I waited 3 years 4 months and 2 days for this movie after Joss Whedon massacred Zack Snyder's vision.\nThe movie was worth the wait.", "Please Warner, learn how to build a universe": "Batman is \"the guy who shoots\".And he kills people, just like Superman and Wonder womanThe movie tells us we must be excited because he teams up with a joker we never really saw being his enemy.Same for deathstroke but even worse.Superman is too strong compared to Stepoenwolf. From the moment he resurrects it's literally impossible for the heroes to fail.The 3 boxes really needed to be introduced in different movies, like marvel did with the infinity stones.Steppenwolf really needed at leash one more movie to be properly introduced, like marvel did with Loki being the villain in Thor before the Avengers.Flash, Batman, aquaman and wonder woman really needed to be introduced in their own movies, like marvel has always done.Ok Snyder i see she is Wonder Woman, you don't need to use her theme every single time she is on frame.In a 4 hours movie there is like 1 hour of slow motions.Using a flashback in order to show an epic battle despite not having created a universe that justifies an epic battle.Imagine a flashback that lets us know that Thanos had already been defeated by other random guys that are not the heroes of the movie you are watching, without having even seen him fight in the present.This movie is just bad.A bad superhero movie and a bad movie in general.", "Justice done!": "Amazing. Spending 4 hours is of total worth. They have given depth to various characters. Direction is intriguing. If you think it's like rewatching the previous Justice League but trust me, it's nothing like that.", "A must watch for every DC fan": "Everyone must give a 10 for this movie as it represents what a DC movie is", "Honestly quite dull": "Gave it a chance and honestly, it was quite drab. It's a four hour movie where the first two are spent with nothing happening to really push the plot point. Batman was rendered useless for the most part of the movie, the fight scenes were awful with the heroes having no dynamic scenes to show off how different their abilities were and why the needed each other. It tried to put metaphors and narratives that came off as meh. Too much slow motion too! However, it wasn't all bad... the flash scene was good use of slow mo but my god... that ugly run style. I guess it's a good background movie, but if you're a Batman fan, maybe not so much", "The Ultimate Redemption": "This movie is a love letter to all our younger selves, who would look to the stars and the sky, squinting against the sun to catch a glimpse of the red cape. After drawing my curtains from seeing the whole movie in one sitting, I felt the same feeling.There were tons of moments where I laughed, and proceeded to get my eyes all teary at some scenes.So how is it different? The tone is corrected. Compared to the original rainbow themed movie, this movie, with its visuals and cinematography instills in the viewers the seriousness of what is going on in the DC Cinematic Universe. A dark being who has destroyed worlds has now come into theirs. This is no time for jokes, this is the end.Furthermore, Cyborg's story arc plays out beautifully. The earlier version showed Cyborg as some grumpy dude who's angry because his father resurrected him? But now there's legit reason for him to be angry and finally, his joining the League looks and plays out all the more beautiful.Then there's Darkseid and Steppenwolf. They feel like the villains a God and meta-humans need to team up to fight. Then there's the Joker's scenes. I'll try my best not to give out any spoilers but BOY that is probably the best dialogue in ANY DC movie EVER. And yes, I do include the Dark Knight trilogy, but in one sense. The Joker in TDK has quotes regarding Philosophy and concepts, such as madness, the nature of good and evil. But in Justice League, his quotes are a biography of Batman. A look into his mind from his greatest villain.I can rewatch the whole movie 10s of times JUST to see those scenes with Joker in it.Ultimately, Justice League did what Marvel took a decade to do, build characters that you fell in love with the moment you were introduced to them.", "The Justice League we should have gotten": "When will the studio realize Zack Snyder knows what he's doing. Just let him make the movies without the studios stepping in. The studio can just sit back and collect the piles of money.", "It's perfect at last": "It's just another movie.

Scenes only available through the - of what the eyes can see - but not upfront but inside, in the dreams histories of man only dared dream of.\nAs sad as it may be, every step of humanity has its own share of our greed. Positive or negative it may be, the delay has been caused by the selfishness of the studio that has produced what ultimately can only be called trash, which was released years ago. But thanks to the rallying of men and maybe the quarantine too, it is now released as how it was intended to. Though it has its flaws. I love this movie and everything it represents. I am hoping for more and is excited of what's to come, not just in cinema but all mediums of art as well.", "This is what a justice league should look like": "Those complained about Snyder being too serious when in reality he tried bringing a realistic edge to the superhero genre love it or hate it but in watching this I found a whole new level for him he's a genius and this is his masterpiece it's crazy thinking how we didn't get this version in 2017 like wow if this is the one wb seen they haven't a clue tbh I think they looked at the success that marvel where having and wanted to compete on their turf using similar themes instead of standing out the way Zack truly has here this is a masterpiece and yes four hours can seem long but that's they beauty of home viewing we can pause and resume perfect for those who trusted and those wanted to get that god awful taste out of their mouths from 2017 now I wish to see a sequel and the stories set up like Ben affleck Batman solo outing hopefully will at some point but Zack Snyder has outdone himself they say every director has one masterpiece and I think this is Zacks he's found his groove", "Finally true DC movie will request dc to continue this version": "The movie had all that which a Justice League fan hoped with it. I really loved the movie as it fills the gap of its previous version. This story has more depth, more detailing in the movie. While the previous version has so many faults in the story line contrary to that this was more complete. I really love the was all the characters are built up giving each character their origin which was missing the previous one.\nImportance of flash cyborg Aquaman wonder woman in the fight with Steppenwolf was clearly depected. I was not a fan with the depiction of batman in the previous version but I liked the batman of zynder's justice league. I do realise if this would be the final cut in 2017 many of the scene would have to be cut short but but still it would have been much more better than what we got.", "Better than the 2017.": "It's better than the theatrical cut.

Unlike the Joss Whedon version, the Zack Snyder version succeeds in every way and beyond my expectation. All characters get their roles, even cyborg, flash, and also Steppenwolf have deeper character backstories than the previous version.Apart from that, the joke in this version is also not overblown and it flows with the story. Its explanation, motive, plot, and other are also explained in detail. The stunning cinematography of Zack Snyder makes this 4-hour film feels short.So, as a movie connoisseur, Zack Snyder's Justice League is an epic film; with Snyder's astonishing visuals, JunkieXL's incredible music score, and The smazing crews behind the production, i can claim this film is the best of the best.", "I'm eagarly waiting for the sequals of zack snyder": "Zack Snyder vision is brilliant.

WB please restore the Synder Verse.", "Dang, now this is how you do it!": "This movie was leaps above the previous one, yes it's 4 hours but it leaves you engaged throughout! Definitely not a movie you start watching at 8 or 9 PM but man, this movie is a Avengers comparison! How much love Avengers receive, this one should receive the same! I love DC and Marvel, my favorite superhero is and will always be Superman, then Hulk but my goodness, Zack redeemed himself after the bits and pieces of hero movies he put out with Man of Steel, Justice League and so on! This is the 300 of DC superhero movies! Before this the best DC movie was Wonder Woman, now we have a new leader!!!!

I would definitely recommend watching this amazing movie.", "This is how you create a DC movie!": "I would rate it 0 if the movie didn't respect Batman just like Joss Whedon's cut did. I love Batman, and he's as badass as he was in BvS. The movie is dark, logically correct, coherent, and touches your heart if you're a DC fan. The villain is not a loser, just like he was in Whedon's cut. Steppenwolf is intimidating, and I like that. Hats off to Zack Snyder. He is a complete genius! Loved the movie. I am rating it a 10 out of 10.", "The best superheros live action assemble I've seen": "It's what Marvel's Endgame tried, I love how you can feel the heroes here are almost godlike beings, and every single hero was needed to finish off the villain's plans.", "Second try": "Basically its JL 2017 plus more stories...too dark...", "Syder > Whedon": "Any scene in the theatrical cut I liked, was present.

This version of Zack Snyder is the Justice League fans deserved. Much better than the 2017 version. One of the things I liked the most was the development of the characters, in the Snyder version it is much better, although it lasts longer and, the truth is, those 4 hours flew by. I loved.

But of course this just blows the 2017 Justice League out of the water 'Aquaman Pun'.\nAll characters are expanded on and explained which is just beautiful and Cyborg really was the heart of the film.Bruce Wayne/ Batman - Not as serious like in BVS which i was a fan of but he was fueled with rage in that film, he is a leader and motivator for everyone in the team and really connects well to the original comicsDiana Prince/ Wonder Woman - Best we have ever seen of her and her updated theme left chills down my neck to finger tips.Arthur Curry/ Aquaman - My favorite for personal reasons, explains his troubles with Atlantis which do differ to Aquaman 2018 but nothing too different, this is just a perfect role for Jason Momoa as a life long fan of him.Barry Allen / The Flash - My god what a complete difference, Barry was amazing in this and i personally cringed at him before in the JL 2017. he has one scene which is just so epic and you know your looking at someone who can handle his abilities.Victor Stone / Cyborg - Zack really did put his vision through Cyborg, most important character in this film - not going to say anymore for him watch for yourself.All villains had their motivations which were fleshed out and understanding plus the theme which surrounds them is stuff of nightmares - we need to have a sequel as it cannot end on that note!Thank you Zack & HBO MAX am based in the UK so NowTv thank you also - #RestoreTheSnyderVerse & All love given to Autumn Snyder which this film is dedicated to.", "This is what DC needs if they want something big in the future, not yust individual films.": "I was never a DC fan.

One of the greatest comic book movie ever made...": "Finally, after waiting for several years, reading multiple posts on snder cut we all got to see this. I just don't get...why they haven't released this before. Even though I watched the theatrical version, this movie felt completely new. Excellent intro to each superhero. Cyborg and Flash have become my favourite in this movie. Their characterization was well defined with much importance where as in theatrical version they were just present.", "Think for yourself / Question the illogical and average critics": "There is a misconception bertween artwork and consumption. Beyond the fact that cinema always seeks to be profitable, there is no need to entertain everyone.It's irrational not to understand how there is a deeper development with each of the characters in the League, especially those who were harmed with the theatrical version of 2017. You may not be a fan of Zack, superhero movies or American comics, and still you can fully enjoy it if you let yourself go.Reviewing the most common complaints: The aspect ratio is uncomfortable, the slow motion are unnecessary, the chant of the Amazons is annoying or that it shouldn't last the 4 hours. All are authorial decisions that together work for the absolute technical enjoyment that the director aspired, decisions that were already taken from him when he retired from the project and he wanted to integrate them together with his characteristic style.Do not be convinced by wannabe critics, form your own opinion and let yourself be carried away by the mythological lore that characterizes DC in the \"Justice League\", as it has never been seen in the cinema.This comics have narrow roots from the Gilgamesh tale, to Hebraic symbolism and the Greek Olympic pantheon. Zack Snyder's Justice League is contemporary polytheism at its best. A virtuous audiovisual epic tale.", "LOTR revisited!!": "I never felt that I would experience the feeling of epic-ness I experienced while watching Lord of The Rings. This comes pretty damn close. Although I enjoyed Marvel ,I was getting jaded with it as it did not evoke awe. This movie did and I am so happy for it.\nHoping DC continues with this universe and not just copy the marvel formula. For all those who have watched Justice League as kids, please watch this. This is how we all envisioned it although we never knew that we did.", "Same, but 4 hour long in 4:3": "What a waste of time. Here is a spoiler for you. It's in 4:3 format!!!", "Welcome back.": "Been always a fan of DC Comics. This is the comeback that we all needed. Great job Snyder. You have restored our faith back.

Thanks again", "Now, now, now this is the DC movie we wanted": "Seriously, DC movie had never been this good, or should we say they were not presented well until this arrived. 4 hours is not such a long time, if you get this type of content to watch.

Snyder has just done the perfect justice to the justice league movie.", "Justice for the League.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League, the complete version of 2017's Justice League is finally here. Yes, I said \"the complete version\" because that's what I've always felt since I watched Justice League 2017, incomplete. But in this movie it has given more details, information and little bit of Snyder's love. We can see Zack Snyder's passion all over the movie. Watching the movie felt like Snyder lives in each and every frame of it. Even though watching a 4 hour long movie is exhausting all I felt was the cinematography washing away my exhaustion. I have never seen such bad ass villains, surely better than Justice League 2017. They looks terrifying and I could not believe their ferocity. It seems CGI team did their job better than expected. But what I love the most in this movie is its colour tone, which is totally different from the Justice League 2017. So I give my sincere gratitude for the visual effects artist who has done an amazing job. Finally it may be not the great masterpiece but it is one great movie u can watch and remember the power of people, fans and men.

Cinematography, visual style, character development, Junkie XL's score inspired from traditional folk music and its philosophical symbolism are worth all the praise. It surpasses the ultimate cut of Watchmen in ambiguity and epicness. In a world full of superhero formula films, ZSJL served as a visual treat and an honest example of exceptionalism. It has everything that fans wanted and more than it. It's a masterpiece.Nnote: This is my suggestion that if you're planning to watch it you should buy it legally and make a little contribution to #RestoreTheSnyderverse movement.What will we achieve from Snyderverse?

It's a film that teaches us to have no fear, to embrace our true selves and be confident. This film broadens the scope on what it means to be a hero. It means losing, it means messing up. But it also means standing back up, It means shouting so loud that your voice echoes to the heavens and hells and they hear you say that \"we have no fear and we're willing to fight the coming darkness in our lives regardless of their might.\" This film is a well inspiration, a beacon of hope, that even the coldest of hearts can't withstand or even a reluctant hero that talks to fish.\nThis film highlights that even though we may have different upbringings and come from \"different walks-of-life\", we can still can rise up together and stand tall in the face of darkness. We can challenge and overcome our greatest demons with those who truly understand us and those who have our backs. This film is about unity, comradery, coming together in a time of hopelessness to ignite the spark that will save humanity. That will resurrect the hope that was taken.\nTo quote the great @TheTyroneMagnus \"The #SnyderCut is not to be watched, it's to be experienced.\" This is a film like no one has seen. Completely unprecedented in the field of cinematography. A directors true vision brought light by the millions of voices shouting to be heard, yearning to see the universe they love just one more time. And just like how Superman's death scream spread far and wide for all to hear. So did the call for this film.\nFrom Barry breaking the sound barrier to save Iris West, to Diana clashing her Bracelets of Submission to save a room full of kids, to Vic realizing he's not broken or alone and that he finally can rest in his own body, this film has it all. The kick-ass fight scenes and badass shots we all love in a good CBM. To the heartwarming themes that get portrayed that inspire us to be better versions of ourselves. This film has something for all to enjoy, weather you're a hardcore DC fan that reads comics and dives in to all DC related media, or you're just a casual movie goer who knows the characters of Batman, Superman and Wonder Women that have been mythologized into our culture as icons to aspire to.

The film will give you goosebumps, smiles, tears, the works! It's a beautiful feast that goes by fast and leaves you wanting more!This is not the 2017 Justice League movie we once saw. But an epic journey, completely different, filled with new heroes and villains. There's a fully immersive storytelling which allows the backstories, team's assembly, and battles to work perfectly flawless on the canvas of Snyder's masterpiece.

This film is everything fans, and regular movie goers, hoped for and more!It's a MUST SEE for all!", "Best heroes film ever": "Show down to the fan and bring out for us one of the best film ever.", "Epic masterpiece.": "What an absolute epic if a masterpiece that should have set up the start of so many DC movies and justice league sequal. We were truly robber that snyder was unable to bring this gem to us the first time around.The music, tone, and dark atmosphere to a world ending situation is so authentic. So tired of the slap stick comedy nonsense when real.

New favourite movie ever.": "This review isn't 10/10 just to push the movie. I admit that I have loved Zack Snyders DC movies and I have been looking forward to this day for a loooong time. But even though I was fairly certain I would like it, I definetly underestimated how incredible this movie would be. As a die-hard DC Fan I can say that I have seen a lot of bad or mostly mediocre DC movies recently. But this movie is far away from those. This movie gave me everything I wanted and more and made my little comicbook-fanboy heart melt, cry and scream out of pure joy (probably cried like 7 times, screamed and applauded so loud my whole city could hear) This quickly became my favourite movie of all time and I will watch it a lot in the next years to come. Thank you Zack Snyder and everyone involved (Including the fans that fought for this) for this incredible adventure.

WB & DC, stop getting in the way and let this man make great movies for us, the fans and make money for you. This movie is the justice needed for what was put out in 2017. I highly recommend that comic book fans, DC fans and movie fans watch it.", "This is the synonym for Justice in live action.": "The care, the affection and the direction that the history takes, it is undeniable the perfect work of Zack Snyder in Justice League (2021).

I feel that most of his movies were underwhelming and left a lot to be desired. BUT having said that, I wholeheartedly believe that ZSJL is not only Snyder's best work till date but arguably the best Comic book movie in memory; and yes, I am including The Avengers Saga and Nolan's Batman Trilogy.Unlike other comic book movies which seem to scoff at the idea of a comic book movie and how \"none of it makes sense\", ZSJL embraces it along with all of its fantastical elements and the over-the-top world building. It gives enough credit to its audience that they will appreciate those elements the same way they appreciate them in the Harry Potter or the The LOTR movies.However, commitment to the source material is what we have come to expect from Zach Snyder by now. But, this time he also surprises us with a tight script (I know it is 4 hours long) where each and every scene naturally pours into the next one creating a flow which carries you through its 4 hour runtime with so much ease that you cannot help but wonder that why did you not get to experience this ride earlier. Also, for a change, It is not trying to show its character's at their most 'badass' but at their most 'human' unlike the misbegotten 'Theatrical Cut'.All in all, I strongly believe that Zach Snyder's vision for DCEU needs to come to fruition for the benefit movie as well as comic book fans, the superhero movie genre, DCEU, WB and Martin Scorsese.", "A True Perfect Piece!": "There are many goosebumps scenes in this movie. All I felt at the end is having a perfectly balanced dinner. To all the super hero movie lovers this is a must watch banger. Awesome action, Fantastic Sound tracks, Well handled emotional scenes turns into a master piece!! Bow to Snyder for bringing this to life!", "Best DC movie since the Nolan trilogy": "I am so pleased that Zack Snyder got to finish his vision, and doing that he has set a new bar for future dc movies. The character arcs are 10x better than the theatrical cut and so was the world building. Definitely a lot to watch in one go but it's worth it if you can, if not, it is split up in to several parts which are great stopping points. It's so great to have a awesome superhero movie after this COVID movie drought.", "Justice has been done": "Thank you for releasing the Zack Snyder version, the threatrical version was a horror film.", "A Vision Realised": "Zack Snyders Justice League is beyond far and wide better then the version we got back in 2017. There is so much more reason and Context to scenes that were part of the 2017 version that zack had shot, even from scenes that fans haven't seen before. The motivation and drive for are Heroes is a lot more planned out and it gives more time to explain why each hero has a reason to be apart the journey. The villain Steppenwolf is given more context and layers to his story as well as motivation for the film and visually looks amazing and menacing this time round, the films tone and look really sets up the world has high stakes with the threat of Steppenwolf as well as a potentially looming bigger threat. I overall thought the film was a vast improvement even though 1 or 2 visual effects are noticeable and could have looked better with more given time it didn't take me out film, The runtime is 4 hours long but if you are along for ride like I was those 4 hours fly by.", "This movie is AWESOME!!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is incredibly epic, everything a DC fan desires, the truth is that I have no words to describe the feeling of love and hate that this movie caused me; it only remains to thank the director and the support of the fans for such a wonderful work of art.", "Snydercut review": "This movie is soo good its every thing I dreamed for i love every character arc", "Worth to watch": "All the new scenes are worthy they have so much references, action and character development i like them all, the 4 hours of the movie are enjoyable and the best parts ocurs at the end and of course the post credits scenes are 10/10", "GREAT MOVIE BUT": "Just a few scenes needed brushing like Wonder Woman and aqua man just coming out of the rocks that fell on them, what was that about ?? \ud83d\ude02 & some dead jokes.

All the extra scenes were necessary and just so great.", "Snyder Gets The Last Laugh": "Absolutely fantastic from beginning to end. I was worried that the movie would seem to drag at points with it being 4 hours long, but by the end I wished I had another 4 hours to go. Cinematography, score, and everything were too notch. If WB doesn't throw an open checkbook at Snyder to return, then we've all lost.", "ZSJL stides over the body of Josstice League": "I don't even know where to start here, there is just so much improvement from 2017 JL to ZSJL. For one Steppenwolf gets alot of character development, as well as The Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman. The slapstick, cringeworthy, corny jokes have been removed and the overall tone from the music to the gray filter on the film to the dialog is all heavier, darker and grittier. I don't know if I can put it into words but it truly feels like an EPIC, the score stands out night and day compares to the 2017 version. The addition 2 new Superheroes being teased was a great touch too. Also it explores the Nightmare Timeline a bit more which is a welcome addition, since Zack Snyder set up that timeline in BvS but in the 2017 version of JL we didn't get a single thing about it. Overall this is a mature superhero film that isn't for those who want to watch a marvel film. Or a film that's light hearted. This film Is grizzled and jaded, and Zack Snyders Justice League pulls it off amazingly. Fans of Watchmen, MoS, BvS, and DC fans in general will no doubt thoroughly enjoy this movie.", "This was amazing": "Thank you Zack Snyder!

This movie also has a better explanation of the prologue and continuation of some of the characters - and that is where it stops for me.Sure, it's long with a lot of entertaining moments - like the previous, but this one is longer. Unfortunately it also, truly, feels much longer. Most, not all, but most of the increase in time is a very \"good\" amount of slow motion - up to the point of an extreme amount in my honest opinion. I feel there is just too much, way too much. Outdrawn is a decent word.What really made me yawn though - I'm sorry, but I did - is the fact that mister Snyder thought it was a good idea to literally cut out all humorous scenes. No chuckles. There are movies that are excellent without chuckles, but this one was just simply better with the humorous moments.To me, it would be amazing if he/they made a third cut. One where he/they removed most of the slow motion and added the \"chuckles\" - as I like to call them.I'm rating it like this because it's not that bad, it just isn't an improvement all in all - for me.", "Review em portugu\u00eas": "Que jornada para todos os f\u00e3s, um presente uma obra prima o filme que todos os f\u00e3s queria e amaram ver, o Snydercut \u00e9 tudo que o Zack Snyder prometeu e muito mais, o melhor filme de super herois da hist\u00f3ria, e to na torcida para que a Liga Da Justi\u00e7a Do Zack Snyder 2 aconte\u00e7a.\n#Releasethesnydercut", "Beautifully done": "Love all the changes and the new stuff.

That was incredible.": "Before watching, I was afraid that the film would not live up to my expectations. Because the expectations were the same for the Justice League version directed by Joss Whedon. After the film's failure in 2017, there was hope and faith that Zach Snyder's version would be released. And now 3 years have passed, she came out. The mood for the film was as follows: I really wanted Snyderkat to succeed, but there were skeptical thoughts, because this is a repeated retelling of the plot that I had already seen, and how can this version surprise !? ALL!Full disclosure of characters: history, experiences, problems. You can see the motivation of each and the importance of all the characters in the script. You believe and empathize with everyone, even the Steppenwolf.Steppenwolf, he changed, he looked like a formidable villain, and not like the 'understand that' from Whedon's version.Removed all the ridiculous jokes and scenes that were in Whedon's version, which brought the film to a new level of perception. The jokes that Snyder used are appropriate, and in the context of the plot, and in the whole picture, they fit very coolly into the narrative.Separately, I would like to say about the musical range, it has become much better and you perceive everything that is happening more emotionally.Graphic arts. I was waiting for a problem with CGI, because a little money was allocated to finalize the release of Snyder, and very little time for post-production, as for a project of this scale. But Zach did a great job. Of course, there were scenes where you notice that it could have been better. But these scenes are insignificant for visual perception. But the main battles and action, in terms of graphics, are at their best. Where graphics were important, they were excellent.Timing at 4 o'clock was not noticeable at all. It feels like you're watching a standard two-hour movie. The desire to pause did not even arise. A phased, measured narration is very engaging in viewing a picture. Scenes that are supposedly unnecessary add even more immersion to what happens in the film.Darkseid is even more formidable and more terrible than Steppenwolf. I would like more of it in the overall timing. But what was shown was very cool. Such incompleteness in the narrative with Darkseid gives hope that maybe we will still see in the future the continuation of Zack Snyder's vision in the DC MCU.In general, the plot is built amazingly. He left a huge amount of emotion, which was so often lacking, after watching films from the DC Universe.For me, this is one of the best films by Zach Snyder. And the best film in the DC MCU. Hopefully, after the success of his Justice League, he will still return and unconditionally lead the movie DC, and Warner Bros. will give full creative freedom of action, as it was in this version of the Justice League. The film is a masterpiece, it was incredible. Thanks, Zach.10 out of 10.#SnyderCut#RestoreTheSnyderVerse#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague", "So much better than first Justice League": "Loved it from start to finish, let's hope Zack makes another.", "Greatest superhero movie ever made": "Snyder is a visionary, he not only created an epic but a movie that would be cherished for generations to comeEven though it's 4hr long, it doesn't feel like it.Truly an epic, a must-watch for every superhero movie lovers", "Overlong and dissapointing": "This could have been 1 hour 30 shorter, scenes are drawn out trying to raise suspense/emotion/intrigue and fail on all, its too slow for the first half and it struggles to recover, in the end there won't be a sequel so what was the point in #thesnydercut o look tedious amounts of slow motion for no reason.", "Just finished the Snyder Cut": "Just finished the Snyder cut.. I literally don't even know if someone can review this after seeing it only once. I've never seen something like it, it's good, but it's more like a work of art than a movie. It's so unlike a normal superhero movie but it's also not like watchmen, man of steel or bvs. There are definitely rough edges from where you can tell he had to stop filming, but it's so big, so grand. In many ways it's like the lord of the rings, with so much symbolism and big moments with a feeling of something larger. This is not to say it's near as good but it gives you the same feeling. 4 hours almost feels to short like it could have had even more which is weird to say because each scene even when the pacing is lacking feels like it matters.It's 100 percent better than 2017 like I don't even know why that movie got released after seeing this. It's 100 percent unique, and it's definitely a top tier superhero movie, but I feel like I'd have to watch it ten times to place it because it's got so much symbolism, so many important motifs and honestly just so much content.It is not for everyone, if you like marvels formula and only like superheroes the way you want them to be, basically one dimensional, then you probably won't like it which is fine. But objectively it's good, maybe great and it's unique.And even though I love Zack Snyder it's not what I expected like, the first hour flew by but I felt extremely unsatisfied by it but then it builds so well with such momentum that at the end I forgot why I felt that way and it all culminated beautifully. I look forward to watching it for years to come.", "Give Me the Snyderverse": "Absolutely Incredible, one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. Would totally be down to view more movies in this longer format on streaming services.Can't believe the studio originally cut all but 10 min of Zack's footage in favor of millions in reshoots for the theatrical release back in 2017. This is cinema. This is how you do a true-to-comic movie. Someone needs to save DC films and get this IP as far away from Warner Bros as they can.It's now apparent Warner Bros has destroyed the DC film universe. I couldn't care less what they make next, if it isn't continuing what Synder presented here, I don't want it. After the Josstice League in 2017 I had hopes that they'd course correct but after Wonder Woman 1984 I don't have any desire to see what they've got in production.Awesome movie Zack, well done.", "Longer, Darker and Better": "Although parts of the movie are similar to the original cut, the ending is completely different. I like how they gave enough time to focus on the story development and just not rush to the end. The visuals are the best and music is second to none. What I like most about this movie is it is long(>4 hrs) but it's worth the watch . It is packed with lot of action and amazing storylines.I felt like the original cut didn't do justice to any of the characters actually. Also in the original cut, they made it seem like none of the characters are important other than superman. He comes at the end and steals the show. Synder's cut is very different . They show the team work and the bonds they made with each other. Overall a great movie and I'm glad they continuing with Snyder's version for the subsequent movies. Great job !", "Finally a movie that is like the comics": "If WB doesn't give Zack his job back to make more of JL movies, they are more lost than ever", "Excellent movie": "This movie was well formatted. They took time to develop the movie characters. Zack nailed it man.. this was his masterpiece since 300. I was totally entertained. The story kept building to a capitulation.

With that being said:This movie is 100% an improvement to the 2017 release. The 4 hour length feels appropriate as it flushes out the plot lines occupied with the previous release, where previously it felt at every corner new characters, new storylines, new enemies, new supporting cast were being introduced without the context to truly validate their inclusion. The Snyder cut with few exceptions addresses mostly all new angles introduced to the DCCU with the previous release - yet simultaneously introduces new elements without fully fleshing them out appropriately.It still feels bloated, it still has a confusing theme between lighthearted banter in contrast to comparisons to superior nearly religious beings and iconic dramatic imagery, it still feels like they are rushing to the finish line that Marvel has accomplished over the course of a 13 year period with a quarter of the amount of cinematic releases.The Snyder Cut of Justice League is a gigantic leap in the right direction to correct the previous direction of the DCCU. I hope it is continued. The source material deserves appropriate representation in cinema.

It firmly puts Joss Whedons effort in the bin. It doesn't feel like 4 hours long as the story keeps you firmly planted in your seat as the story unfolds. The cgi is crisper and sublime. The only disappointment for me was still the lack of Henry Cavills Superman character. In my opinion he still deserves another stand alone sequel to Man Of Steel.

Zack Snyder's Justice legue Has set the Bar High this time around. Weather you take cinematography, direction, action sequences, dialogues, background score they will just blow your mind. Visionary Director Zack Snyder has figured out the justice legue this time around and has excelled all our expectations. The movie run time is 4 long hours but you will never get bored for even a single second, the story is written very well that it never gets out from the plot, the story plot is divided into 6 epic plots all having a quest filled with action packed sequences, epic dialogues, story passes through all the 6 plots just like butter which is should be apreciated considering the Zack Snyder's visionary storytelling and direction. The characters this time around are well sung and there past stories well connect with the characters past experience which were witnessed in the past DC Movies. Performances of all the DC Characters really takes the movie watching experience one notch higher.

Although I have already known most of the plot and how the ending of the movie would be (as I have been following the news reported by the fandom and the photos and concept arts Snyder himself posted on Twitter), this movie still exceeded my expectations and is far beyond imagination.Honestly, when Snyder's name popped up in the beginning of the movie, my eyes are wet and couldn't imagine I am really sitting there and truly watching the legendary cut which didn't have the chance to be put on the cinema. To me, this is beyond a movie watching experience, it's a dream comes true and a symbol that reminds the world that Zack and the fandom have prevailed.The CGI is great and Steppenwolf's design is really cool and finally made him a villain. This movie is tied with the previous movies, especially BVS which has an important effect on this Justice League movie. All the new members' origins are told greatly and successfully built up the whole story. The Flash and Cyborg became one of the foundation of the League and are no longer some merely childish or pure machine, non-human figures. The new soundtrack is absolutely great, especially the new theme of the Justice League and Batman. Wonder Woman's theme is also polished and showed how an Amazon and warrior should be.In sum, this movie is a masterpiece to fans and I believe those who are new to this universe or didn't enjoy the theatrical cut in 2017 can give it a try and experience Zack's vision of the iconic DC super heros.", "Superficial and pointless": "So many glorifying reviews however this film same as the first one was a waste of time and left me craving for some good acting and some depth.", "Left me wanting more!": "I am not big on watching long movies.

It was truly one of my favorite cinematic pieces of all time.", "Worth the four hours and left you wanting more.": "Spectacular.

It was cohesive, enigmatic and a wild ride from start to finish. The former installation of Justice League felt about a hundred hours long and not in a good way.As a lifelong comic book fan of Superman, I have been disappointed for the way he and his universe have been portrayed. FINALLY, I felt myself get excited to see their story play out. The characters had such chemistry and it made so much sense for the DCEU that *could be*.I have a lot of complaints with DC dating back to the nonsense with Superman's mucked up backstory and some other non-canonical shenanigans, but they finally did something RIGHT. Its ok to change up the backstory if you make it make sense! Marvel does it all the time to suit their big picture and its ok when you make it work, and I finally have some hope that DC can also make it work.This was ridiculously exciting to watch and I can't wait to see what happens next.", "Made an account just to rate and review": "10/10 this is the quintessential super hero/justice league movie.

A ride that brings out the inner-kids and open the floodgates of memories of us watching Justice League the animated series.\nLet's hope for the next release which is more like JL 2( Batman's Knightmare).

It's a great comic book film with characters brought to life in an extraordinary way.

Dont miss it...": "Same storyline but the way snyder elaborated is an actual treat. Equal importance to all characters. Far better than the first justice league. Good dialogues, screenplay, and acting of everyone. Bruce wayne looks so handsome and sexier than in the dwan of justice. Superman entry and his way of punching is marvelous. Flash and cyborg took a greater role. Aquaman and wonderwomen also did a awesome act. All the unwanted things from first justice league is removed, and i really thank snyder for that.

I will say the cgi for sure a step down from the likes of Marvel so I knocked it for that.", "Restored Synderverse": "Watched this movie in one go, feel connected to every character.

No.He is till the one who excute suicide mission,where is ur brain ,dear Bruce.\nAquaman? useless\nCyberman? useless\n......", "I just loved it. Thanks Zack": "It's worth all the wait. Still I feel sad that it didn't happen back in 2017 atleast 3 hrs should be given by the production so that we can see the beauty of this movie. It's not for children it's for matured audience let all of us agree to that we need or we deserve the 2nd part of it. Coz at end it makes me feel curious to know what's gonna happen next. Such as Bruce nightmare might not be the same future. It's just a warning for him things will be different than what he saw. About the knightmare scene I've to say it gives me the vibes of apocalyptic world in which you can see a group of survivors as a resistance team . I'd love to explore that world. Also I think we have three or more confirmed superhero that'll become part of another movie. They should named it jl United or jla United. Or something classy. It's a masterpiece wish we can see another part of it. Let's hope for it \ud83e\udd1e", "It was better than the original, but only marginally.": "The story was better but the pacing seemed intentionally slowed to stretch it out into a series that never happened. What was the parts nonsense? All the end scenes were unnecessary, just an attempt to set up the next venture with these characters that I am not any more sold on than I was before.I feel like a lot of people love this cut simply because they wanted it so bad so they can't fathom NOT loving it. Man of Steel wasn't memorable. Dawn of Justice had plot issues a mile long. I just don't think Zack Snyder is that stellar of a director. Watchmen was decent but I almost wonder if it would have been better without him.I was hoping this would be successful because I want studios to be unafraid of making longer films. We are used to binge watching shows, we can handle long movies, when they are good.", "Oh boy!": "As much as i must say that i actually liked the first Justice League movie, i cant ignore the fact that the movie was bad. Remember liking doesnt mean its good, starting there, when i heard about the Snyder cut, i was not sure what to expect. Im so happy to say that after the 4 hours the story fits, creates continuity and THIS is the way DC has to take the lead, i like MCU but DCU is my jam and i just cant wait for JL 2 and 3, i hope it gets made, cause we all know this format would have not worked on a cinema, who knows, maybe this is the new beggining to characters so many people love and cherish, thanks Zack Snyder!", "Never a dull moment, entertainment for all. Justice has been served.": "First time reviewing...This movie and the hype that surrounded it made me think this may either be decent or terrible, It was neither, it was absolutely brilliant, cannot believe how good it was and how different it was to the theatrical version. Jostice League was terrible, everytime I watched it, it made me think... what if... what if Snyder was still director. To be honest it was a good thing that he was not, otherwise even his vision would have been difficult to portray on the big screen with WB execs strange run time limits.There was honestly no dull moment, this properly sets apart what DC is in comparison to Marvel. Marvel is great, but this movie... kind of felt like a superhero movie for the adults (yes I know watchmen exists).It's crazy to think WB had actually let go of Snyder, such poorly made decisions is scary to think of. This movie was at least something that Covid played in to the hands of Snyder and the fans. This movie also is not just for the fans, it will keep the whole family entertained.Also, this movie perfectly sets up for part 2, it will be a massive opportunity missed by WB if they do not go ahead with it and also not let Snyder direct it, hes an amazing director, the more movies he comes out with the better he is getting, and he really does understand comic book universe, especially DC.Couple of very cool surprises in this movie too for DC fans too.Will definitely be watching this movie again.", "God yeahh": "Snyder really knows this job.

It gives the backstory to the characters, unlike the previous one with huge missing pieces from the story. If we would have gotten this version instead of the other one, I think we would have more movies out now. Wake up WB, this movie is what the fans want!!!!", "Movie we deserved!": "This is actually a movie that respects audience. It does not think of us as of kids that needs entertainment.\nIt has a solid plot. It is actually hard to achieve. Marvel movies has that too, but in this movie it comes not from explanation of the characters, which is alright, but not if the explanation is given for an incredibly obvious thing, or they just repeat same stuff again and again. Harder and the better way, that gives us not theatrical, but cinematic experience, is a smart and consequently ordered scenes.\nThis is the way audience can get the idea and answers by himself, by watching the movie and making logical connection through the movie. Some movies like to use the plot with lot of explanations said out loud, cause giving information with scenes, music and very few words is actually hard. That needs talent or hard work. This is the way you can get THE MOVIE, not a poorly connected scenes with recap coming from the characters. This is way to create something rewatchable, cause when the other movies with trending and hyping themes, bleeding edge graphics and \"teenager humour\" get old that even previous auditory would not watch it because they overgrown it, real movies will be good and classic any time after as they have holistic and smart plot.", "Worth The Hype.": "Coming from the reception it's predecessor Theatrical Release. This movie was bound to be a success from that horrible botched up mediocrity. But one thing that always bugged me a lot, does this movie actually be worth of the hype it was getting.??\nAnd finally after binge watching 4 hours of this movie(without even taking intervals). I am Glad to say that this movie is definitely WORTH EVERY HYPE AND PRAISE it's getting. It's by far one of the strongest, engaging and epic DC movie i saw..\nso i am not gonna spoil anything here. people needs to watch it.\nAnd Yes this movie isn't perfect for me. But i also realize that the things i didn't like is mostly i was nitpicking bits and pieces.

The action scenes were great, the character building was well developed, and the plot was well considered with direction showing that the movie is part of something more. You can tell that if WB didnt ruin it with the original crap in 2017 this movie would have been a really big hit. Hopefully the director and actors get to finish off the story in a couple of sequels. Only negatives is a couple of fight scenes early in the movie look fake, and the movie was a tad long. 3 hrs 30 min would be better. Its actually run time was 3:45.

It's only now, after seeing Zack Snyder's Justice League, that many viewers will be able to look back at Batman v Superman and see what Zack always saw and intended for this series. Knowing where it was headed, now you can go back and better understand what the filmmaker was doing in the previous films.", "One edit away from perfect": "Zack Snyder's Justice League delivered on the impossible: making an honest to God enjoyable movie about the Justice League within the DCEU continuity.Snyder returns with a film that accomplishes actual character arcs and villains that feel like a threat big enough to assemble the team.While the movie is a lot of fun, 24 minutes or so of the movie are shot in slow motion which does feel like overkill, and there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to include any single Knightmare sequence since they work as fan service but do not add anything to the movie we are watching. Maybe one edit removing those flaws (yes they are flaws) would shorten the movie to about 3 hours give or take, making it easier to re visit.", "Longer, darker, better": "Snyder's version is way better the Whedon's crap. Yes, is way too long but it is justifiable because of the much needed back stories of the characters (heroes, villains,and supporting cast) and scenes that add more soul and substance to the story.

I can accept with disappointment that the Snyderverse is at an end and if it is then fair enough but at the very least WB and DC need to know that this is the kind of movie we DC fans are after.

And it paid them off well, even if it doesn't match the comic book exactly but audience liked it.\nMarvel has its way of doing things.For DC they're best at graphic novels. They need attention and they present enormous amount of details for which audience need to present their full attention to get hold of the story line.\nThat's what Mr. Snyder did with his earlier movies and presented this chery on top of it.\nMan of steel was the birth and construction of the universe. It was a sci fi movie and amazingly set up krypton and earth.\nBvS ultimate edition was when things became more dark because you have Batman being introduced. And the storyline is pretty much about Batman feeling an aliens presence. Also it had to show what Superman was going through even after doingg all the good in the world.\nThe story in zsjl was carried out very well and delivered justice.

Occasional clunky dialogue, some clumsy exposition and iffy CGI. That said it's an impressive cinematic achievement and truly epic in scale.

To me this entry demonstrates that DC did not give Snyder the freedom he deserved and cut short his time at the helm prematurely.The epilogue is a masterstroke.

It is nowhere near a 10/10, I may have even rated it lower if this were the original release. My biggest complaints being way to much slo-mo (every single action scene has multiple slow motion shots that hurt the pacing) and the lack of originality in the score. Positives for character building, especially for Cyborg and his father; great acting and really help establish his character. Still not a fan of this Barry Allen, his \"comedic\" take just feel awkward and the lines that should be funny just fall flat for me. The scenes with his father were cringey at best. CGI and effects are outstanding; Darkseid and Steppenwolf look incredible. Overall, while most of Snyder's additions help expand on the story and improve the film, some are too long and tend to drag. Others feel outright unnecessary (I will spare you any spoilers, but Jared Leto's Joker is still horrendous and I could have done without his entire one scene). I do want to give big props for including \"Parts\" in this version. 4 hours is a daunting runtime, but the film is cut into 6 parts, complete with title screens, which really help to break the film into more manageable sections.

I can't necessarily articulate how incredibly amazing this film's thematic thesis is. As soon as I saw the opening scene, I knew I was in for something incredible. Following Superman's death, the whole world is plunged into despair. A new wave of crime affects the world, and worst of all, the Mother Boxes of Apokolips have re-awakened after several millennia, signaling the Apokoliptian conqueror Steppenwolf to come back to Earth and claim it for his master, Uxas/Darkseid. This forces Bruce and Diana, who established their camaraderie in BVS, to recruit other lost isolated metahumans to their cause before the world is destroyed. Hell, Bruce's arc in BVS continues in this movie; he was inspired by Superman's legacy and sacrifice because it reminded him of what being a hero meant. Superman GAVE Bruce another chance at life, so Bruce took it upon himself to look for other lost isolated metahumans so he can pass on the example and legacy Superman left behind.In conclusion...PROS:\nJunkie XL's score (yes, even the feminine choir for Diana and the Amazons)Stellar cinematography and VFXPretty damn entertaining actionCompelling and cohesive story with high stakes and deep lore (esp. when connected to MOS and BVS)Bruce's arc from a vengeful man in BVS to a man of faith in JL is just awesomeSuperman RETURNSThe other metahumans going from isolated to united due to Superman's example and legacyThe lore explored with Man, Amazons and AtlantisBadass characters (heroes and villains)Balanced toneCONS: (mostly small problems I had; nothing major at all)\nAquaman didn't have as many badass/epic moments as the rest of his teammates (though arguably this can be considered less of an issue)Martian Manhunter; it's cool a fan theory was confirmed but since General Swanwick was a part of MOS and BVS, it would've been cool to see him actually take action in the final battle along with Superman.", "Much needed origin setups for Future DC movie verse": "No wonder Zack was insisting on 2 part movies but this whole makes the movie and DC universe complete giving back story and there powers origine or justification for there powers and also foreshadowing what the possibility are for the future movies.", "Very good, must see": "When i first heard of the supposed \"Snyder Cut\", i thought it was going to be just 15 minutes of more scenes, nothing big that could change my opinion about the 2017 version, which i thought was a mess. Flashfoward to now, ZSJL is a completely different movie that gives each character time, we explore the story behind each hero, their motives, their emotions, we start with a divided group, and in the end you can actually believe that they are united, the process is organic. In this movie, i care for Cyborg, Flash, Aquaman, because their story is shown, developed. Whereas in the Theatrical cut, they were like footnotes, we got glimpses of Cyborg and Flash's backstory, but nothing significant. Same for Steppenwolf, in here i understand why he's here, and he's deeper than just a generic grey villain, i even got kinda sad for him. These four hours were spectacular, the shots are beautiful and well done, the story flows great, i got involved and didn't want it to end.The only things i didn't like were some of the dialogue, which was very expositional, it seemed directed at the audience, and not at the character, and some of the Special Effects were clumsy, but that's because of the small budget, so it's understandable.Before this movie, i wanted this version of the DC Universe to end for good, but after this, i want a sequel, i want to see more, i want to see this Darkseid and this Justice League expanding in the years to come.", "The Justice League We Deserve!": "ZSJL gave us everything we dreamed of. The emotions, the action scenes, the representation of each character's core values...\nSeeing Jon appear as the watcher on the wall was more than I could've asked for.Steppenwolf's suit was amazing. A proper impression of the dark and depressing vibe expected of Apokolips tech.As for Darkseid, the feature as Uxas showed us a side of him we've never seen on live TV; brash, impulsive and cocky. A great prequel to what to look forward to in the more sadistic, matured Darkseid.The introduction of the dark Kryptonian outfit was a refreshing look on Superman. I also love how he was depicted as a new being who's shed the weight of his previous life.Batfleck was a sight for sore eyes, as always, and same goes for Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Cyborg.But perhaps, my best experience came from seeing Ezra Miller's Flash achieve the incredible feat of time travel. I got goosebumps watching that scene.Overall, ZSJL was refreshing, emotional, drama-filled and satisfying to the core.I've seen it 12 times already and I still crave for more!", "Guzel": "Guzelgggfghhgtggghfghggfggh hhfgfffhggggff jgggg hhfgfffhggggff", "The best superhero movie of the decade": "This is what we all expected and more.

It's epic, amazing to say the least !!! Make injustice please! \ud83d\ude4f", "The Light from the Dark": "I've often heard that Zack Snyder referred to Batman v Superman as the \"darkest before the dawn,\" and that many fans have taken that to heart. I myself, as a huge Snyder fan, believe this to be the case. In my eyes, his DC movies have always been about taking the characters to the point where they resemble the paragons of hope and justice that we see in the comics. Zack Snyder's Justice League perfectly gives us the answer as to how true that is. This movie is absolutely incredibly. In it, Snyder and his writing partner, Chris Terrio, have done an absolutely incredible job in crafting not just a casual superhero movie, but an epic that matches the likes of Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. The tone is completely different from Batman v Superman, and yet at the same time, makes complete sense picking up from where that movie left off.\nNow I was a fan of the Whedon Justice League, despite its many flaws, I love the characters and I felt it was still a fun movie. But Zack Snyder's Justice League completely outshines it. More than a popcorn flick, there is incredible emotional weight to the film, not only due to the writing, but as well as the acting. All around, an incredibly talented cast - but there is no denying that Ray Fisher's Cyborg truly is the heart of the movie, and Ezra Miller does a fantastic job with Barry Allen.\nI've seen a few critics and average viewers complain that Snyder's Justice League is really just the same movie as the 2017 cut, simply with some added deleted scenes. But they should know - deleted scenes can make all the difference. Think of the difference in reception of BvS theatrical cut, and ultimate edition. Generally, yes, there is a basic story structure that is identical to the 2017 cut, but the extra 2 hours of content provides additional information that helps to flesh out not just the heroes, but the villain we have in Steppenwolf - at the same time introducing Darkseid as the \"ultimate\" villain.\nIt may take additional viewings to really see any significant flaws, but I am happy that Zack Snyder was able to bring his vision to light. Love him or hate him, it's clear he has a distinct and interesting, if controversial, take on the world of DC, and I hope Warner Media brings him back for at least an HBO MAX series. If they don't, I'm glad we at least got to see his Justice League.", "ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS": "So fricking amazing\nIf this was released in 2017 who knows it could have made 2 billion dollars or maybe 1 and half billion dollars and we would have already gotten Justice League 2 or something\nOMG THE CHEMISTRY THE DIALOGUES THE EPIC CINEMATOGRAPHY THE SCORE THE SOUNDTRACK THE FIGHT SCENES THE SKIES THE ENDING THE JOKER THE DEATHSTROKE MARTIAN MANHUNTER CAPTAIN ATOM aka Dr Ryan Choi LEXY DESAAD GRANNY GOODNESS AND DARKSIED!!!!!\nIn 20 years time THIS IS THE GONNA BE REMEMBERED AS THE GREATEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!\nHell even in 5 years if Warner Bros decide to make Justice League 2 with Zack Snyder then that movie is gonna be CERTIFIED HELLA BLOCKBUSTER\nOn March 18th 2021 it's gonna be written that it was this day ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE became the BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!", "Best movie I've seen in a long time": "Loved everything about it definitely will watch it again and again!!", "Absolutely Fantastic": "Snyder give the justice to every single character this time.

God Bless.", "4 hours 2 minutes of oh my god!": "This is a one of the greate movie in DCEU history. Strongest story line, well performed stars, screenplay, music, graphic drive the movie to next level. It's a 4 hour middle finger 2017 JL. It's a 4 hours of oh my god moment. Have lot of Easter eggs for fans. There is lot of nots in ZSJL. Hope he will untie those in upcoming JL 2 & 3", "An Absolutely Amazing Movie!": "With the initial release of Justice League, I was disappointed by the reviews & rumors coming off the set. Because if this I never watched the initial release of JL. (This is 100% recommended btw.)This movie is absolutely remarkable & truly deserves high recognition. The subplot of Victor Stone, Cyborg, is a breath of fresh air when it comes to a coming of age story. The dynamic with his father was extremely well put together & their family tragedy really set up Cyborg's character throughout the film. Ray Fisher, I hope you are proud! You did an amazing job & deserve all the nominations this coming award season.The rest of the cast was given very well out together scripts, even down to the recurring characters who have just popped up throughout the other films. Gadot, Miller, Affleck, & Momoa were absolutely amazing & I loved the mystery the put behind Jason Momoa's origin story to Aquaman. The atlantean's suck you in & force you to get excited for the Aquaman movie. Amber Heard & Willem Dafoe were a small roles but really stood out in their acting skills, bravo! With the Flash they stacked on to the little cameo he gave in BvS. They need to make sure Flashpoint is made, done justice, & includes Ray Fisher.**Major Spoilers**The Epilogue was REMARKABLE. Please, HBO Max, do whatever you need to do so that the rest of the Snyder universe can be created. The implication of Atom being added to the team, a Batman movie with Harley & Slade, Martian Manhunter being there the whole time, a stand alone Cyborg film (maybe he forms the Teen Titans??) and, of course, at least one Justice League sequel so we can see Darkseid wreak havoc.", "FANTASTIC MOVIE!": "ZSJL is an absolute masterpiece...This film is everything that a DC fan ever dreamed of . Visually stunning and narratively satisfying from start to finish, it is not just best DCEU film of all time but also one of the best superhero film of all time...Joss whedon should be burned alive for butchering this masterpiece and ruining Snyder's vision in 2017..But true fans loves Snyder's epic vision for DCEU that's why they called out for this film in after whedon's disaster..Zack snyder delivered a perfect superhero film here,filled with some of the best visuals ever seen in a movie, eye popping effects, stunning cinematography, eargasmic soundtrack by junkie XL and breathtaking action scenes ZSJL is everything you ever hoped for and even more then it looks initially..This film proved again that Ben affleck and Henry cavill are best Batman and Superman of all time..Jared Leto as joker steals the show, steppenwolf is monster looking warrior from other world who just wants to invade earth for his own personal reasons, darkseid is an evil tyrant lurking in shadows of different side of universe..This film also works as an origin story for cyborg, he is struggling to find his place in the world torn apart between his human and mechanical identity... Batman became a hero again after spending years in rage and hate ,here he is a hero and leader who is honouring Superman after his death via defending this world, the killer vengeful version from BvS is long gone.. wonder woman is helping humanity and continuing her duty to defend the world.. flash is trying to be a hero who wants to help people and still learning about his powers...aquaman is also struggling between his human life and atlantean heritage as a king, and finally heart and soul of DC Superman...In mos we've seen an alien trying to find his place in the world,in BvS we've seen a conflicted hero who is struggling and finding how to be a hero.but in ZSJL we've seen a true Superman who finally became a hero and ultimate protector of earth .An ideal to strive towards...Even side characters like Lois,Martha,Silas,desaad,martian manhunter, joker got small but meaningful part...At last I just want to say this is the movie we've been waiting for our life....If you don't loved this movie don't call yourself as a DC fan....It's time to restore the snyderverse now because without ZACK SNYDER and a complete JUSTICE LEAGUE TRILOGY DCEU is nothing and will fail soon again...Only a full snyderverse on HBO max can save DC now.... Go watch it and get ready for a lifetime experience... 10/10. A+", "Take my. Money and more hbo!!": "Just wow.... This was LOTR epic and we got to watch it at home, what an experience .\nI would literally throw any money for more of this from zack snyder and this vision of a universe or alternate verse.\nPlease God, DC and HBO, u have done it. Now keep going with a good thing, hopefully u get all the support from the viewers fingers crossed", "This is SOMETHING!": "This is that GOOD, genius, has flaws which I have no concern to make them problems. If you love CBM you'll love this film, if you expect more from CBM, you'll love this one even more. It's grand, epic, visionary, full of heart. I think it has some kinda pure fan services, because it all set up by the story, by what it is and what it should be, what we'll see, not something like we want, and would like it to be.", "Fantastic and Far exceeded the predecessor": "I will state that Zac Snyder for me is top 3 living directors when it comes to visuals filmmaking. He's a master of telling amazing stories without words to rely upon. With that being said he is not always the best when there's actual dialogue and from time to time the pacing can feel drawn out and labored. When I saw the extended version of The Watchmen, it was one of the few times for me that a great movie was made lesser by the longer unedited version.So if course going into Justice League my fear of the same occurrence was lingering in the back of my mind. Thank goodness that fear was proven wrong. Breaking it up into Parts certainly added greatly to the ability to watch such a long story without getting exhausted. And so far every addition that was lacking before had added to the story in beautiful ways. I hope this type of storytelling continues with visionaries like Snyder at the helm, because that will do DC the Justice it's deserved for a while now.", "this dang movie": "This dang movie fixed my failed marriage, best movie ever", "Everything is should have been...": "Simply wonderful. Think akin to Watchmen and forget your Disney tent poles. Justice done.", "Best Movie": "It is the best movie i have ever watched!\nWith all the details to everything.

After watching the Snyder cut and being glued to my seat for 4 hours I can honestly say the DCEU May have a chance at redemption. It felt like an entirely different movie with the same plot. After the 2017 Whedon disaster I can finally fall in love again with the entire cast of ZNJL.", "Unbelievable Justice is served #RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE": "We made it and I couldn't be happier please let's just forget the hack job that came before and canon from this, the true Justice League!!! The Score, graphics, fighting, character building and depth it's has everything. Villains you dislike hero's you can actually see layers to. Thank you Zack Snyder!!! Justice is served!", "The best film": "In my opinion, one of the best superhero movies that have been filmed today, although its duration is very long, its content is exciting and highly explanatory, highly recommended.", "How it should be": "I have been waiting for this movie since 2015 when they first announced the original slate. This movie did not disappoint and met and exceeded all expectations. This is the new standard.", "The true DC experience !": "Now I can say that the movie presented all that I expected from a movie of this size, the film presented six chapters that were distinguished by the sincerity of the nature of the DC world, and now a strong background for the movie villain, and the characters such as Cyborg, Flash and Batman were wonderful, great battles and justified decisions and not stupid like the 2017 version, I hope Warner Bros is bringing back the world of Zack Snyder", "JL I've been waiting for. A much better film and an amazing fan service.": "First of all I would like to thank each and every single person who fought for this movie. It's because of you that we got this movie. Thank You so much <3We cannot talk about this movie without talking about 2017 Justice League. Every moment in this movie you'll be like \"Wow, this is so much better\". And of Couse the reason is because it's a vision on one director. What makes ZSJL better than JL ?\nLet's start with characters, in the JL nobody cared about Cyborg but here my god his entire back story is so good he is heart and soul of the movie, Ray Fisher did such a fantastic job. Then we have The Flash who plays such an important part in this movie (you'll see) whereas in JL he was just an idiot. (Still don't like the way he runs though). This is the best version of Wonder Woman we've ever got, period. After the shitbag that was 1984 this was much needed change. Batman here plays the role of a leader. I wish we saw more of that detective version of him which this Batman lacks but it's so much better than \"something is definitely bleeding\". Talking about Aquaman I'm not sure which one I liked better this version of Aquaman is more available emotionally where as that in JL he was just badass. So it's preference and that leaves us with Superman and yes the moustache is gone so 10/10 on that but his return makes so much sense here it's more tensed and at the same time him meeting with Martha and Lois is just is so good. Talking about big baddie of the movie Steppenwolf he is handled so much better (a word you'll find everywhere in this review xD) but he has a motive which he lacked in JL. Motive alone gives him so much depth to Steppenwolf in ZSJL. We got Darkseid and he was awesome and his origin or backstory why he targets earth is fantastic as well and it makes so much sense. Now the things I didn't like about movie, It's a four hour movie and I don't have any issue with that but there are some scene which just didn't work. Score of the movie is overall better than JL but it's a downgrade from Man Of Steel and BvS. The team dynamic is great but at times it can feel like it's not earned yet. There are couple of scenes from JL which I would've liked to see in this one or wish Snyder wrote them. Would I support restore the Snyderverse ? Yes, I know the direction they were going to take with Snyderverse and I liked it but I think there should be more movies in between so that people care more about these characters. It feels a bit rushed at times and if they want more casual movie goer then we need to spend more time with these characters and looking at what we've seen from ZSJL this universe could've and can work so much better. Last but not the least this movie should be celebrated not because this is Zack Snyder's movie or I'm a DCEU fanboy but because this shows fans have voice as well. Studio had no option but to listen to fans and the movie we got makes everything better. Excited to see if we can get more from this universe. Hope everyone enjoys the movie as well.", "This is unbelievable": "I am watching it now. This is the best movie I've seen in years. 4 of the best hours of entertainment ever. This should be nominated for awards.", "The \"should have been-\" Justice League": "At first, I wan't sure of my expectacions of the movie. I mean, the original theatrical cut wasn't something I would see again. But after after seing that Zack Snyder's imagination of the film would be released by command from fans and critics, it made me interested and gave me pretty high expectations.With this version of Justice League, Zakk Snyder brings a gritty and dark action-packed marathon of a movie with some hints of Marvel-esque storylines and brings what the movie should've brought in theatrical cut. WIth two more hours of film, they brought much needed scenes that makes the story and why some choices in the movie was made, much more sense. I would compare this movie to Marvel's Infinity War and Endgame with both having to sacrifice and come up with solutions to deal with the threat of off-world beings and having the fate of the world in their hands.They also did a good job with the cinematography, audio and visual effect to show the more dark gritty and destructive world than what we are used to with superhero movies.So if you like action-packed superhero movies and you have four hours to spare, I really recommend giving it a try. But if you can't watch it in one go, they have made the movie into parts, so you could watch it like a mini-series if you want.So is this a ressurection of the DCEU franchise? Lets wait and see...", "Top notch": "Visually splendid and character arcs make more sense now. Worth the wait.", "Far better than the movie we got in 2017": "It's not a perfect movie, it has it's defects and it know it but I believe that you can really appreciate this movie, which has some very epic scene.\nYou finally get to see the league United , where anyone has it's role , anyone is important.\nOverall I think that this movie gets you emotional when you see the team United, and this is the most important thing that the movie had to do.\nI WANT TO SEE HOW IT CONTINUES, PLEASE CONTINUE THIS STORY.", "Stunning! Memorable!!!!!!": "Great Pace, Excellent Cinematography, Memorable Scenes, Amazing Storytelling.... MY HEROES ARE BACK !!!!!!...... Way to Go Zack!!!", "Maybe It was Just me": "I enjoyed the movie overall but i have to Say some moments were a no go for me im not really going into detail or ill take way to mutch time (get It)PS vfx and special effects could have been better.", "Amazing movie .": "What was once incomplete is now complete\nWhat once had a piece missing now is whole\nThis movie is perfection.\nZack Snyder's vision is finally whole\nHope he gets to make more DC movies", "Ok movie, horrible aspect ratio, too long.": "No one at home has an IMAX screen. This should have been cut knowing no IMAX theater would show the film in the near future. And if he wanted to do the IMAX version then release 2 versions so home users and the rich(theater goers) could watch it their way. Most people especially now can't afford going to a theater, both for their health and pocket book. I for one, have not gone to a theater since 2000, and that was too expensive.", "lmao": "Zach Snyder's Justice League is a bad movie, but it is better than the 2018 release and it's also better than Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. Take that for what it's worth.It's a bloated, self-important mess, but that almost goes without saying. In brief: Snyder directed two previous DC movies very very poorly, and the studio placed greater pressure on him for the 2018 theatrical release of Justice League. Then a sudden and awful family tragedy led to Snyder stepping down from the project, leading Joss Whedon to finish the project, also poorly. The movie released, underperformed, got thrashed by critics, and disappointed people who liked Snyder's previous work.Which brings us to the obsessive internet movement which led to this film's release: fans of Man of Steel and Batman V Superman took to the internet over a period of several years, demanding to anyone who would listen that Warner Bros. release the Snyder cut. The movement was marked by constant misogynistic and racist harassment of movie critics who Snyder fans were insufficiently deferential to their favorite movies. Boy oh boy, the internet sure has made it easier than ever for large groups of people to encourage the very worst in one another.But somewhere along the lines, someone at Warner Bros. decided to let Snyder have another crack at the movie - using previously unseen footage and also writing and recording a great deal more and giving him ultimate permission to be as self-indulgent as he wants. And thus, here we are. Four hours, divided into seven parts: Zach Snyder's Justice League.I'm not gonna spend too much time detailing the plot. Even though it's four hours, it does still ultimately boil down to: bring the superheroes together to defeat the bad guy. You've seen the broad structure about 50 times.What makes this film better than Snyder's past work in the genre is the characters. Batman V Superman looked on every single one of its characters with contempt: Snyder League wants every single one to succeed and rise above their pain. I didn't connect with this movie's themes of coping with loss and finding connection after trauma because I thought the way it communicated those themes was clumsy and boring. But I could see there was a genuine attempt at getting those ideas across, and if the internet is any indication there are people with whom it is resonating.It's also much less confusing than the two previous Snyderverse films. Action scenes now feel as though they have clearer geography and stakes, due respectively to better editing and better storytelling.But my god, is it an absolute slog. A lot of the acting isn't good (Batman and Flash come to mind) and a lot of the dialogue is worse. In many places, Snyder substitutes empty platitudes spoken by characters and slow-motion high contrast cinematography for genuine depth and meaning.I'm genuinely happy Snyder seems to care so much about these characters. But having sat through the entire movie, I can't say he seems to know how best to use them. Having extremely notable creep Joss Whedon take his project and apply a thin layer of MCU aesthetic was not the solution. But I think Snyder is frequently confused in his artistic vision, and he does need some kind of help if he's going to keep this up. Not the studio jumping in and making changes to the movie based on their whims; more like an artistic partner who can curb his worst instincts and help him realize his vision more effectively.", "THIS IS IT !": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is an absolute brilliant superhero film and best DCEU movie so far. Very different than the theatrical cut. The pacing, action, acting, cinematography/visuals, and score are spectacular. Zack using every bit of 4 hours to build up the story & character development in a way that feels entirely earned.", "Amazing, this is the real JL!": "It's awesome.

The plot and storyline is so much better in this version, the pace can be slow at times but it's mostly because of the overused slow motion scenes, the actual plot is pretty fast. Steppenwolf has so much better character background as a disgraced general who's trying to get accepted back home, instead of just a mumbling galactic conqueror. Cyborg's origin is thoroughly explained, and he and Flash has a much bigger parts in this version. The embarassing Joss Wheadon's butt-framing trashes and sexist jokes aren't present which is surely for the better. Batman is much more serious and brooding, and he doesn't make stupid jokes anymore, which he shouldn't done in the first place. The emotional scenes for every characters is much more meaningful and touching in this original version. This is the Justice League that the fans deserve, unlike that 2017 Avengers copycat movie. 10/10 for me.", "Simply exquisite movie, worth watching many times": "This movie is so amazing that it can literally give dceu a decent boost, the 4hr runtime of the movie didn't feel like 4hrs.

We get to know more about the main characters to give us the chance to understand the way they become part of the story, we get to see the elaborate setup of many of the key elements of the plot, and we see a perfect plot of a superhero story that is superior in terms of consistency.But the movie is made, and it has its benefit and advantage: Zack Snyder's Justice League is a down-to-earth superhero movie with god-like characters possessing godly powers, with enough and elaborated story and plot setup that makes all this look and feel not bizarrely overpowered and ridiculously deus-ex-machina-esque.

Everything was so visually spectacular i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Definitely wayyyy better than the original one. This movie is gonna stay with me for the next couple of weeks for sure. Inspite of watching it on the small screen it felt so amazing. So so glad we got to see the Snyder Cut. Now I can clearly say DC is in the right hands.

Instead of a story, bringing us to connect with the.characters, we get an over dramatic music and character text which is telling us how we are supposed to feel. The movie is taking on establishing too many backstories and plot lines. Even though it is 4H long, it is not enough to give the proper motivation and story arc for three new characters, the main bad guy, the universal big bad guy, and the actual plot of the movie.The characters are unbalanced and a the story is not relatable. Snyder, again, shows us that he is incapable of telling a story for grownups.

They share few of the lines but have nothing in common. Steppenwolf in this movie has very clear job, a very difficult task. He has a purpose and it's very well grounded. He's on Earth not for some boxes but to conquer this planet and continue with other ones. This guys is in dept and has to pay it. He has done something wrong in the past and now has to suffer the consequences. I love his devotion to that task, I love his EMOTIONS shown with beautiful CGI. I love every line from the mouth of this terrifying blood thirsty creature. They reinvented this character completely from the comic books, gave him a new arc. To me Steppenwolf is the hero of the story.", "Go Superman go": "The best part of that movie is Superman and just because of this I give a 7 however the rest was ok, with a very strange ending .", "Booming": "It's a great come back for DC as this explains a lot and the time doesn't matter for me as it just made me more excited till the end and seeing Darkseid actually seeing our heroes fight Steppenwolf.", "JUSTICE DONE RIGHT!": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is nothing short of a masterpiece. It is a movie that is vastly different from the 2017 version but similar at the same time. The stakes are higher this time around and everything makes sense. It is extremely well written. The characters are clearly much more developed in this version and you actually understand their motives. This includes everyone from the Villains to our beloved heroes. However, the stand outs in terms of character arcs are definitely Cyborg. Flash and Steppenwolf!The movie begins where Batman V Superman concluded and it grasps your attention right off the back. The beginning sequence alone explains the awakening of the motherboxes. It's a very well put together and beautifully shot sequence. Snyder does a great job ensuring that you stay glued to the screen and not miss a single frame. You get to see the live version, both young and a more mature one, Darkseid in action and its a sighting to behold! It's probably one of the most comic accurate depiction of a character to embrace the screen. The VFX are amazing and do not feel cartoonish like in the previous version. I wish we could see more of him in action! That's not say the main antagonist is any less worthy. Steppenwolf looks and sounds amazing in every scene he is in. We actually get to know the character and understand his motives. It makes sense why he's after the motherboxes.\nThere are cameos both small and large in terms of time on screen. These include Vulko, Mera, Deathstroke, Martian Manhunter, Lex Luthor and the JOKER! These cameos have a place in the overall story as well as grand scheme of things when it comes to Zack Snyder's vision.Overall, it's cohesive, technically improved, visually astounding, better developed in terms of characters and motives, and truly worth all the wait! I can only hope one day we get to see the rest of Snyderverse.", "The movie that I wanted to see.": "The movie that a wanted to see since a long time ago. This movie is awesome and have it all.

Hopefully he does a sequel or perhaps adding green latern into the mix! He deserves a way a remake", "Too Detailed, Too slow": "While the amount of new details was nice to see, the incredibly slow behind the scenes day-to-day cuts between every character was not needed nor should they have been included in this film. The character introductions in the original already opened doors for origin movies, so the slow, honestly boring, cuts showcasing Barry, Victor, and Arthur's powers was unnecessary. Most of this movie is dedicated, it seemed, to slow-motion, which added to the slowness of the film. Barry's introduction scene should not have slowed him down when the world around him was also slowed down, as it made the literal Flash, the fastest man alive, look and feel slow and still. The actual action of the League as a team does not take place until the last hour of the film, and considering many of the commercials showcase the League together and acting as a team, this is extremely disappointing.", "Best movie of dc Universe": "I like this movie,and henry cavil and ban Affleck is best", "Superior In Every Way": "I wasn't Expecting much. But it completely blew me away. It's that much better than the first one. Hail Zack Snyder!", "Epico": "Una pelicula muy esperada y que hace justicia a los heroes de DC comics.

Thank you Zack and Debrah", "It was amazing and I want more": "Zack Snyder's Justice League was a better experience in every way. The longer run time plays a part in improving the film but great writing and directing make the biggest difference.\nEach character gets properly introduced and explored in order to engage the viewer and get them to care.\nThe action scenes have much more force and meaning behind them. We see the heroes struggle to work together and overcome a much more powerful Steppenwolf.\nTheir victory at the end of the movie feels earned through character growth and understanding of each other.\nEverything in the story fits together really well. Scenes are no longer pointless or incoherent, even the comedic beats come in at the right time during the less energetic moments, never interrupting the fight scenes or serious moments of the movie.\nFor a self-contained experience, this might be the best team-up super-hero movie out there.\nIf this was the start of the DC Extended Universe, I would have been a big fan.\nI honestly wish we get to see more out the universe Zack Snyder was building.", "Not perfect, but still AMAZING": "This is coming from a neutral CBM fan.The film obviously has it's own flaws. The writing goes into exposition mode many times, so much so that I wished there was more 'show' than 'tell' in those scenes, or that the 'tell' itself could've been better. Holkenborg's music is amazing (The Crew at Warpower is instant earworm) but it sometimes becomes repetetive. The aspect ratio didn't bother me, but I know some people that were annoyed by it.Apart from all that, this is an epic amalgamation of sheer vision and imagination, great acting (standout performances by Miller and Fisher), brilliant music, jaw-dropping VFX and editing and action choreography (watch out for the truck crash scene!) and stunning production design. The scale of Zack Snyder's vision for the DCEU is massive, and he's a great director, and it shows in every frame of this film (especially the Knightmare scene!)Second best Comic-Book Movie ever, after The Dark Knight.And WB needs to friggin #RestoreTheSnyderverse ASAP!", "just the way he made for DC world": "If there is any chance to resurrect dc cinematic world snyder cut is that way to redemption we hope for more and more from him\neverything was perfect and even a single part of the story left untold\nin one word description\nMARVELES", "It was awesome!": "It was 10 times better than 2017 version. 2017 version was unclear, fight scenes weren't that much satisfying. also BGM is so awesome in this 2021 version.

Batman/Bruce Wayne who happens to be a brawler samurai, world's greatest detective who almost killed Superman, fought doomsday & been torturing maniacs at night, shouldn't be trembling to speak up at least to Arthur curry(Josh whedon bloody hell read your material), this version of the movie doesn't have absolutely dirt jokes or forced sexual innuendo(no WW butt), it's as seamless as heat(1995) in building up tension, acting to Argo (2012) levels action sequences probably better than Marvel & the most important a complete character arc for its characters. I don't imagine anyone but zack snyder making a better DC movie(to which Nolan also agrees),If watchmen(2009) was bold, this one is explicit.I second what Nolan said to Snyder (don't watch JL(2017), it'll be too painful to watch.The difference between criticism (JL )and (Blastphemy)Snyder Cut is the difference between the Godfather & mega shark vs super piranha.", "Justice is served !": "THIS IS ABSOLUTE ABOVE AND BEYONGThe movie is indeed a masterpiece and zack is a brilliant director, hats off to his vision and doing justice with the fandom.", "Absolutely Brilliant & nothing else": "It is an absolute masterpiece..

The pacing was nicely done and the cinematography & visuals wer stunning.

It's passable, at best.": "The original cut of Justice League does have a huge advantage over the Snyder cut... the original cut is only 2 and a half hours long! If you're going to make me sit through a four-hour movie, something bloated and joyless(partly due to the colors being so washed out), it better be a damn great time... and it's NOT.Instead, what we end up is a movie that is improved, but only barely by adding more scenes, but by adding to the runtime, and adding UNNECESSARY scenes and editing this thing in such a way that it takes an eternity to sit through, and you notice the length a hell of a lot more than in Star Trek: The motion Picture... It's not good.Why does Martian Manhunter appear? He doesn't enhance the story, and he doesn't have a dramatic purpose. Also... the actors portraying these characters are fine... but none of them give all that compelling a performance... which I chalk up less to their ability as actors and more to Snyder's inability to direct a snail out of a shell. Affleck is okay, Cavill is okay, Gadot is Okay, Ezra Miller is... intolerable, Jason Mamoa is Okay, and Ray Fisher is... okay. The cast is overwhelmingly meh. I'd much rather watch the worst MCU movie, like The Incredible Hulk or Iron Man 2.Seriously... Snyder is like a slightly more talented Michael Bay... and that's it. That's the limit of his talent.So why does this thing get so much fan praise??? Beats me, probably because there's a lot of fan service, and I guess Joker's remark about giving Batman a reach-around was the kind of hardcore thing we needed in a Justice League film.I think part of the disappointment also comes in the fact that people were absolutely PRAISING this damn thing up the ass right after it came out, as if it was somehow the best Superhero Movie ever made. No... no it's not(That would be 1980's Flash Gordon).Zack Snyder's Justice League is a bloated, incomprehensible, frustrating, overrated mess, kind of like The Dark knight rises. If you can get joy out of it, absolutely good for you, but just don't expect me to stick around if you start playing this thing on the TV.", "An Epic Masterpiece": "The best DC movie I've seen in years. Absolutely breath-taking CGI and tremendous story telling shared in a seismic four-hour format. Bravo to Zack Snyder. Someone who is clearly a definitive visionary, and someone far ahead of their time.", "Really the best dc movie": "In my opinion, the second version of Justice League should be made by Zack Snyder himself.", "Disappointing": "In my opinion, this was disappointing.

Yes this is for you. If not, don't waste your time. It beats marvel movies but that bar is about here, hence 3/10.

I simply can't. He turned a proper JL movie into Superman and friends as none of the other superstars had any meaningful contribution to the plot.In this cut, EVERYONE gets their moment (maybe a little less for Aquaman and WW - but then again, they have had their solo films, so it is understandable), especially Flash and Cyborg. It was the perfect catapult for these two characters to become great in their own solo movies.The final act of this movie makes way for at least 3-4 more movies, which is why it is SO essential to restore the Snyderverse because the possibilities are simply endless.This movie might just be the defibrillator that brings the DCEU back to life - but with only the Snyderverse in place.", "An opening for a better future (comic-turned-movie wise)": "With no doubt, better than the previous version, and a lot more into character details, even with the fact that the Barry Allen depicted in here looks more like a nerd teenager (which by the way is not that hilarious) Than the joke bomber grown-up character we know from the comics, and also telling us there is more to come, and giving us a lot of anxiety by not knowing if it is Apokolipse now or Injustice what we will have, looking forward for the movies to come and the #restorethesnyderverse plot reveal...", "Joss Has Blood on His Hands": "How this film was shelved in place of the Wish version we got is beyond me.

With deep character developments, worldbuilding, and storytelling. That's what i also felt with Zack Snyder's Justice league. It was 4 hours long but every minute is important and connected with one another", "Snyder deserved his version of the movie to be seen": "While it is an improvement compared to 2017 JL, still has its issues. unexplained plot points that look good on screen, but may not be clear, like the mother boxes being space Alexa activating when superman's scream reaches them. Or do the Amazons always have their warriors standing in attack position around the box 24x7?\nThe Snyder trademark use of slow motion, is a bit overused in my opinion. And the Jesus simbolism with Superman as the mesiah is on par with Man of Steel.\nThe additional running time to introduce the backstory of the characters, while is welcome since they no logner jump from Luthor's folder in BvS (where the villain was kind enough to give each hero a logo XD ), it also shows that it was a mistake (Director or Studio is beyond my knowledge) not to introduce the characters before (either in previous in-universe movies or in staindalone films). It is up to debate if Snyder's version would have been as good as it is now if he had to fit the 2 hours format, or if it would have ended in 2 parts.\nAlthough I think a 4 hours movie could have left out the \"Diana makes tea with Alfred\" scene.\nSuperman's black suit not having a reason other than \"yup, let's make it look cool\", only to have a reference to the comics, doesn't make a lot of sense..\nUnfortunately, having seen other movies, one can't help noticing similarities with other movies: Steppenwolf's entrance hitting the ground with the axe, resembling Thor's entrance in infinity War. Same as the axe nearly killing Darkseid, only that Ares didn't go for the head. Even the \"MOtherbox was buried until the nazis got it and then the allies recovered ir\", is the same as the tesseract in Captain America. However, can't blame anyone for falling into some of the heroes movies cliches.\nIn short, I liked the movie, and I am glad we got a chance to see the original one in its complete form. But there's room for improvement, and discussion, as long as we are able to accept each other's point of view about what we liked and what we didn't like of each movie.", "Much better than expected.": "I signed up to IMDb to post this review.\nI expected this movie to be the same as the theatrical version, with some deleted scenes added back into it. I was wrong. This was far better than the original. Not only did it seem to make more sense, it also made the Justice League members feel more revered, less cheap, and more real. The added scenes were a delight. Thank you Aquaman for making me aware of this version, and thank you Zach Snyder for not giving up.", "Thank You Zack!!": "This movie is so good. Everything is on point.\nHoping and waiting for it's sequel.", "Finally a triumph": "Finally a film with total and I speak more of 100% creative freedom than other films.There is clear character development, especially cyborg, who is introduced with the most dramatic and sad testimony to the league.On the other hand we have Barry, a character who was finally given the corresponding weight and focus.Diana, we saw again what surprised us in BvS, a fearless and determined Amazon when it comes to defending innocents.Batman, although he did not have \"so much protagonism\" managed to deliver a share of the Bat we all know, determined, redeemed in this case.Sups, although his screen time was short, and Henry Cavill's acting skills are not the best, his role as Superman was fulfilled to the fullest.As for the overall development, coherence and connection with BvS now yes, EVERYTHING makes more sense, even giving more weight to the controversial BvS.As a film itself, it fulfills the necessary points to be well evaluated and in relation to the Josstice League, it is clear that it was a film without sense or consistency.For all those haters who vote with \"1\" score, grow up, be objective.", "In a perfect universe this would have been part 2": "This movie.. Wow. Why this wasn't given the proper care and time to be made as intended I will ever for the life of me understand.. I glad I was able to see this movie made...

A lot of things happen for no fathomable reason aside from trying to give the main characters some pain points. I get that these are super heroes, but their motivations are so unclear, and behavior so non-human, that they're almost completely unrelateable.

THE JUSTICE IS SERVED!": "Okay so I watched this film twice:\n1\u00ba FIRST as a common viewer who rarely watches this kind of films, and it's quiet enjoyable, a great character development which explains better their motivations and how the suit the league, especially for Cyborg, not to mention the villain Steppenwolf, although the narrative has its flaws and leaves some plot holes, they ar enot distracting from the main plot. The new socre composed by Junkie XL is superior and a delight to to hear for it builds an epic atmosphere for the creation of the league and gives personality to every character. You never feel the four hours, in my case I didn't notice that there was only an hour left. However I can't deny somethings that made me some noise, especially for a pair of scenes that I found like unnecessary, one especially I thought it spoiled a very touching scene. IS IT A MASTERPIECE OF FILMMAKING? I don't think so,.although it's narrative is almost innovative, having times when you laugh, cry and get thrilled, a film filled with emotions, it has mistakes that won't let this movie to turn into a masterpiece, but I won't deny that it will become a cult film, one that will be studied on film schools.\nNow...\n2\u00ba SECOND I watched as a fan who grew up watching the animated series of the JUSTICE LEAGUE, someone who after school enjoyed watching any show related with the DC universe, and I thought it was EPIC, quiet BEAUTIFUL and a DELIGHT TO WATCH! It's not the best DC film for it still has to surpass THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY but it's one of the best, and can't deny I have to say that the SNYDERVERSE has to be restored, I mean who doesn't want to watch the war against DARKSEID?

Before I was able to read, my father would sit on my bed and read them to me, pointing to each hero and saying \"you see that symbol, that's Superman's emblem.\" I would laugh and smile and be filled with absolute joy as he read to me. And by the time I was able to read, almost all my money was going to comic books.\nI was about ten when Man of Steel came out and I remember feeling absolutely amazed at how deep Zack Snyder had created Superman's character in this film. And on re-watches, I am still amazed. In it, Superman isn't a hero, nor a God, he is simply a man. A human. Of course, he does have his powers, but underpinning it all is the struggle that any 'regular Joe' would face when confronted with the issues he is. Issues of morality and self-image, of love and expectation.\nWhen Batman V Superman was released, I was again blown away at how Snyder had dealt with now both Superman and Batman. He built on the foundations he put down, showing us a Superman, or just a man, that is faced with questions such \"if I have these gifts and people don't want me to use them, would it be worse if I stop and people die? Or would it be worse to be hated, but still save the lives of the innocent.\" And batman. Oh, how good his writing was in this film. A man who's city has broken him. Pushed him to his limits. He's lost himself, he doesn't know how to run his city anymore - unless he is running it with totality controlling his every move. So, when Superman comes along, what is he to do but end his tyranny, as he says, even if there is a small possibility that he will turn evil, he has to take it as an absolute certainty for the good of humanity. Any means necessary. But by the time they actually fight, he finds that Superman is the true human, and he the alien. He's lost his humanity, and he needs it back.Enter Justice League. A movie that takes it time to build the characters within (as that is what Zack is all about), a movie that defies expectations (as a lot of people bagging it out before it was released have come to love it) and a movie that stimulates some of the biggest fan-service moments of all time. The directing is brilliant. The colour pallette, all though bleak, compliments the films tone, and Snyder's world, excellently. Most of the acting is great as well, especially Ray Fisher's Cyborg. The score, sombre when needed to be, but almost always epic and moody. And the third act . . . exceptional.\nThis movie is truly everything #releasethesnydercut fans could hope for. I recommend it to all superhero lovers.

He made it for his daughter, and for the people who sought to see his work finished and believed in him. The visuals are breathtaking, a frame a painting, and it carries weight, heart, joy, sorrow, wisdom, and triumph with it. There's darkness and there is evil unbidden and hungry for power, with talented, flawed, and human people rising up to meet it. Uniting, and standing up for justice, rising to meet with those who seek to destroy their world. And then, with a league of superheroes founded, they save everyone. Evil is not defeated, but it is warned. There's sacrifice, there's bloodshed, tears and fears, but right now, I am feeling proud to have seen this dream made, and brought to us.I consider this movie not perfect, but damn near close.

He treats the art with such total respect (allowing the story to unfold at its natural pace rather than rushing it e.g. Cyborg). His use of sound in this film is something else (from that scene when those women sing for Aquaman as he quietly steals away into the ocean) to the clever use of sonar in those underwater scenes! I'm not going to bore you with my absolute praise of his cinematic brilliance but I'll say this - no one can do what Snyder can do in that department (hate him or love him, he's special!). As a lover of film, I feel a sense of divine justice has been served in the releasing of this film - I should have NEVER been kept from it in the first place.

There is more detail and development to certain characters. The film was beautifully shot and some of the redesigns were an improvement. However, some of the visual effects looked wholly incomplete or poor quality. Some of the added detail also felt bloated or like fluff content. So how much better was it?It is immediately noticeable that sequences of the film have been added to or elongated to a point where many sequences were unnecessarily long or even unnecessary altogether. That being said, some of the detail and added story changes were a positive addition to the story as a whole. A handful of other additions were pretty cool but unless a sequel is ever made are just that, pretty cool. A sort of final major noticeable observation is how little Batman seemed to be involved in some of the group sequences. As much material as was added it was rather shocking how little he seemed to be involved.A handful of characters have some very formative scenes that establish a basis for who the character is and what their motivations are. Despite characters being fleshed out well, these story lines could have very well been better handled as their own movies. The final act of the movie was overall an improvement however.The way that this movie was shot was aesthetically beautiful and with razor sharp imagery. Character redesigns were a more visually appealing style, even if subtle. Although a small number of the redesigns were a bit off of the rails in the department of head attachments or details. Sadly though there were a number of sequences in which graphic effects and animations appeared to be incomplete or simply akin to that of a PS3 game. That sort of thing is sort of inexcusable with the graphic technology we have now. Despite the wonderfully shot sequences the well shot and enhanced skillfully didn't contribute much to advancing the story and felt a lot like polishing for the sake of polishing.So how much better was Zack Snyder's Justice League? There were some nice story details added and some additions to the DC film world. Unfortunately so many scenes really felt like fluff or seemed unnecessary to the overarching story. Again, some characters could have used their own films to establish their motives and story rather than installing it into this film. Visually it was measurably better, at least for the most part, but they certainly lacked adding to the story and merely just looked clean. The scenes in which the visuals were pretty poor were just hard to ignore. Certain aspects were measurably better than the 2017 version, but as a whole it was only moderately better. I prefer this version but personally would have removed a bit of fluff from the film to make it flow better and seem less long for the sake of being long.", "Definitely exceeded my expectations!": "So happy that we FINALLY got to see Zack Snyder's Justice League on our screens! This movie totally exceeded my expectations. The cinematography is exceptional, lots of in-depth character development and the soundtrack is amazing!

I defiantly thinks it was better, But that doesn't help since the 3/4 part of the movie still sucks.

The best scene of the whole movie were the epilogue, which seemed like it was leading of to follow up movies, that hopefully won't happen. Steppenwolf were much better anyway.

Marvel's Endgame or even Infinity War cannot come near to what Zack Snyder has created. It goes without saying that DC has comics with Epic storylines that dives way deep into the characters of the superheroes & the villains alike. Hence a DC story is supposed to be better than a Marvel story in every way possible, also considering the fact that Marvel has so many characters inspired by DC characters, e.g. Thanos is inspired by Metron & Darkseid. Coming back to the movie, it has deep backstories for each character, even Steppenwolf which builds up for the final battle just fine and although some people are saying that the movie could've been finished in 3.5hrs, I personally beg to differ as the scenes that are being considered irrelevant to the main story has been put there to provide depth to the characters otherwise how would it have been any different from the Theatrical cut that Joss Whedon made which btw is now thought by many DC fans to be Marvel's plan all along to bring down DC to dust. But Mr. Snyder has shown what DC is supposed to be, bringing out the big guns like The real Steppenwolf, Deathstroke, The Joker, DeSaad, Granny Goodness, Martian Manhunter and supposedly even Green Lantern if the Snyderverse continues. In 6-7 years down the line if this Snyderverse is let to be continued then Marvel's Phase 1, 2 & 3 would easily fall below the DC Snyderverse.

I cannot describe how much I enjoyed the Snyder cut and how much better it was in comparison with the theatrical release of the movie. It's like a completely different and much more epic film.The pace is great, each character is better developed and is given a purpose for their actions and the time to shine (for example Flash is now the mvp of the justice league, while characters like Cyborg and Steppenwolf are also much better) and the overall darker theme and the more serious tone of Snyder's films fits the characters and the DC universe more.The movie is also visually pleasing and has amazing cinematography and much improved CGI, while the score by Tom Holkenborg is incredible. The greatest thing about the Snyder cut is the fact that it doesn't feel like a 4 hour movie at all, as it keeps you on the edge of your seat during its whole runtime and leaves you wanting more when it ends. There wasn't a single moment where I felt bored or disinterested to what I was watching.It was simply a one in an lifetime experience and I really wish we could see the snyderverse continue into the future.

Whilst the central story remains the same, the execution is done with so much more care and attention. Rather than cyborg reduced to a talking plot point and Flash the comic relief, they are now fully fledged characters central to the events unfolding around them. Affleck, Cavill and Gadot are the best versions of their characters here too, with time for their alter egos to breathe rather than being just living action figures moving from one set piece to another.

Each character gets their time to shine and much needed character development that was absent from the botched 2017 Theatrical release.Most of all, I'm left wondering how and why WB hired Joss Whedon to reshoot like 40% of the movie and how they actually thought releasing the 2017 version was a good idea. This is a completely different film than that abomination in tone and quality.This is a grand sprawling visual epic akin to the likes of LOTR.", "Superseded Expectations": "I wish this was released originally because the initial release let a lot of people down tremendously. There was so much depth and character building in this movie (as DC excels at) to leave my friends and I captivated! I would have sat through the whole showing in the theater. Only critique is that some of the sequences and slow motion were drawn out.I hope THIS version jumpstarts the DC verse. Zack Snyder killed it.", "Breathtaking, satisfying, but could be a tad short": "It was 2010. I was a school-going kid, full of dreams. My dad brought home a DVD player and with it, some borrowed DVDs. Back then, this lending business was a lucrative one. Looking back, it feels now like another age. One of the DVDs was of his choice, contained the Fatakesto franchise, another he brought for me. He had said, \"This contains things from your comic books.\"\nWhen I played, I saw there were two films, the first was Iron Man, and the second was Watchmen. The pirate DVD maker did not care a bit about DC and Marvel rivalry. The film opened my eyes to a brave new world, the second... well, my mom walked in when the 'Hallelujah' was playing onscreen. Then it was a WW3. That's the first time I came across Zack Snyder's work.Now, after finishing Snyder_Cut of Justice League, I am in awe. Because it has given me everything I had hoped for. And even more. In 2013, when Snyder first revealed to the world his 'Man of Steel', I was in confusion, as I was with BvS: Dawn of Justice. They were not the characters I had read for so many years. Then came Joss Whedon's JL, a Frankenstein's monster risen from a family tragedy, studio decisions, and elaborate reshoots, change of director. Frankly, though I was not at all happy with the end product, as it consciously kept distance from all the world-building of both MoS and BvS: DoJ, I was happy to see something at least came. A good year before Infinity War, it was supposed to be DC's entry to a cohesive shared universe.It was not.The editing was terrible, there was way too much exposition thrown in the name of character development, and the story was chopped action sequences very loosely connected to an unattractive story. It was an OKAY movie. JL was not supposed to be an okay movie.Now, after watching what Snyder wanted us to see, I kept scratching my head on why WB shelved this. A huge part was due to the length. 4 hours was not suitable for a multiplex screening. Then again, when you are forced to cram at least four movies worth of material in one movie, it is supposed to be lengthy. Marvel perfected the formula of 'Safe-stories', stories where it did not feel there was everything at stake until it came to Infinity War, and Endgame. Among the Marvel plethora, I only re-watch Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: Winter Soldiers, CA: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War & Endgame, just because of their stakes. They are risky stories. That's why I loved them. As well is Snyderverse.Here, Superman isn't just an alien do-gooder boy scout. He had to earn his title of Humanity's savior by forcefully killing the last of his species. Batman isn't just Batman, he is a broken man, tackling insomnia and some serious PTSD, and he stopped caring about the world. Until Superman died.Then the bells rang.This is a story of 7 loners, i repeat, 7, finding their place. Finding each other. Understanding they have a responsibility for this world.What did I like about the movie?1. Cyborg. Definitely. Without him, this movie doesn't make sense. His dialogue, \"I'm not broken, and I am not alone,\" touched me. He's a kid who had it all, then lost it all, then again began rebuilding himself while saving the world. Not even touching why he attacked superman after his resurrection.2. Flash. Without him, two critical tasks in the movie would have been impossible. Like Cyborg, he was not just another casted face. He too was a loner trying to find his place in the world.\"Your son was one of them, dad, the best of the best,\" he narrated while turning back time.3. Batman. The joke-cracking cape crusader was gone. Returned the Batfleck. He was the assembler of the team, a man who was reminded of his humanity by an alien, a broken soul trying to piece himself together.4. Aquaman. A half-born, an outcast, who could have been the bridge between two worlds was brooding in a village. His interaction with both Mera and Vulko doesn't only explain why he resented his mother and Atlantis, but also why Atlantis did not fight when Stephenwolf collected the Motherbox, like the Amazons.5. The amazons. Apart from the sexist armors, that I believe depicted their ranks, Amazons were portrayed as they should be: a fearless, strong, duty bound race of women who are ready to sacrifice themselves for the cause.\"Daughters of Themyscira show them your fear\"\n\"WE HAVE NO FEAR\"6. Steppenwolf. The generic supervillain of 2017's JL was not only given a VFX overhaul, making him look more menacing, like a Lovecraftian nightmare, but also a castaway looking for redemption.7. Darkseid. Ray Porter nailed Darkseid's bone-chilling voice. Enough said.8. The final battle. Gone was the annoying police siren sound, replaced with an engaging, completely changed third act.9. Lois Lane and Martha Kent. Two women mourning not for a superman, but Clarke Kent. Grief that only two of them understood. Though it was not MK, but MM.10. THE JOKER. Leto shines as the joker like the joker should be. In his twisted, cynical, insane way, he is batman's best friend. A person thriving in the dystopic anarchy of Apocalypse Earth.What I disliked?At places, the VFX looked like VFX. Wonder Woman's character needed a bit more development. Superman was a bit overpowered; I think.Given his artistic independence, Zack Snyder would have presented a movie that could rival Avengers: Infinity War in both scope and storytelling. DC has fantastic stories on their plate, where, unlike Marvel, the men don't try to be gods, but gods were trying to be men. Though the movie was 4 hours long, I did not feel it, like I did in the case of JL 2017. This was a labor of love and it felt in every frame.Seeing the possibilities of spinoffs and sequels, I strongly will want more from this Snyderverse, though it can turn an unrealistic and unpopular idea, even if it is an HBO Max exclusive and I had to see it through BMS. After the completion of Marvel's Infinity saga, there's a vacuum, it is time for DC to shine again. The world is ready. At least, I am.", "A thrill ride from start to finish": "An absolute dream team of superheroes.

Filled with beautiful imagery from the visuals of Zack Snyder, captivating scenes that tug your heart with a string, and relatable new heroes that all ages of audience find themselves rooting for. This movie is an entirely different presentation of what was shown in the 2017 version directed by Joss Whedon. Versions of the characters presented in the film shown 4 years ago such as Cyborg, the Flash, Batman, and Wonder Woman are given a complete 180 with their motivations and character arcs. Cyborg goes from being depressing and distasteful to fleshed-out in Snyder's Cut. Same goes for the other characters; Batman is back to being his serious team-leading self, the Flash is given laughable humor along with several compelling scenes that make you root for the character at the end of the day, Wonder Woman is brutal, yet hopeful compared to her bland counterpart in Whedon's take, and finally, Aquaman doesn't despise the world around him during the 120-minute runtime. The 2 extra hours given to this film is a much-needed breath of fresh air to delve deep into knowledge of the heroes' and villains' reasonings of why they do what they do. And, last but not least, the CGI is very impressive for the limited resources and small timeframe given to complete this movie. A round of applause is deserved for this modern-day superhero masterpiece.", "THIS IS WHAT WE WANT": "Zach Snyder has created an absolute masterpiece of DCBut what annoys me the most is how blind Warner Brothers have been to realising how big the Justice League can be if they put him in Charge of all his visions and plans, which will be a successful path for Warner Brothers.#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE.", "DCEU SnyderVerse has begin": "The movie was actually good , after seeing the 2017 JL this movie feel complete, like there are so many new scenes added about the flash's life and introduction to Cyborg that was needed in the previous movie the Zack Snyder vision of the story is pretty amazing and the characters are remarkable well, the problem is 4 hour length maybe some people may not watch it for its length, but trust me it's a must one time watch\nThe action scene were good and there were extra fight scenes too\nIf this movie was released in 2017 DCEU may have matched the standards of MCU\nBut overall a good fun watch movie\nIf the length bothers you watch it in half-half length trust me it'll be a great experience.", "Best Movie remake of all times": "Simply...

But okay, okay, I can morally ambiguous.When his assistant mentioned to him the crazy higher temperature measurement he just clocked, Mr. Always Knows Too Much for Humanity's Own Good says the line \"Three point five million CALVIN\" (emphasis mine) as though that is an appropriate way to fake your science in ANY movie, much less blockbusters.It's spelled and pronounced Kelvin. Calvin is the insolent blonde boy who pees on rival companies' pickup trucks.Kelvin, however, is our best approximation for something's temperature above absolute zero (as close as we could get, anyway).

He horribly failed.I didn't get the point... the first version was a disaster, so W Bros give it back Zack to make it even worst.My main question - Why this movie was allowed for public viewing??? It has to be banned like Roquefort cheese in Australia.", "Better Storytelling and continuation of MoS and BvsS": "This movie fits seamlessly into the world created in Man of Steel and continued in Batman versus Superman.\nThe Theatrical release was for me like a B movie with A-List actors. Tho I enjoyed it, mainly because it was all I had to go on, I was underwhelmed.Spoilers:\nI was truly fearful the Snyder cut would just add an hour and a half of the same with the exact same story line. Now I am actually grateful for the first film: it stands as an alternate timeline we avoided. All my fears about re-telling or rehashing were unfounded. This film is 20% of the previous version. We miss perhaps a joke here or a piece of music there but not any of the prior plot is missed.This film is more, better, smarter, more DC Universe, and showcases every member of the Justice League to dramatic satisfaction.\nNew heroes and anti-heroes are introduced to chilling effect.\nI'll boil it down to this...THIS cut of the film gave me the same hope, anticipation and pride for the DC Universe that the first Avengers gave me for the Marvel Universe.", "The DC Superhero film we deserve!": "I absolutely loved this film from start to finish. Prefix - I am a massive DC comics fan - especially Superman and Batman.Seeing the characters I love and have followed for years being brought to life on screen is always going to be something I watch, even if other reviews are not great.The visuals in this film are amazing - it's right out of Zack Snyder's playbook and almost every scene has stunning visuals and amazing backgrounds / back drops. The special effects are pretty good and the main difference between Marvel and DC films is around the fight scenes and set-pieces; Superman flying just doesn't seem 'natural' in comparison to how Thor and Iron Man fly for example.The story is hugely different to Joss Whedon's version. Although it follows the same beats, Snyder's version is a more coherent and well-thought out story. At no point did I feel that there was a massive leap to the next act, or a lack of plausibility or any jumping to conclusions. The story flowed well and gave good explanations and exposition to what was happening.The characters feel like they are all individually fleshed out sufficiently and give them good motivation and background. Wonder Woman is great in continuing her story and Gal Gadot really does embody the character perfectly for me. Aside from being tough she's also the field commander for the League. Aquaman is rough and rugged and Jason Momoa's interpretation of him is great. He's something different in the team and the Snyder cut has increased his strength so that he's able to fight Steppenwolf rather than just be slapped away. He's a reluctant member of the team and this really makes me think of this film as being similar to the first Avengers film - where the heroes all unite / assesmble. Cyborg was described as the heart of the team and his story is definitely central to the film. He seems massively overpowered and a solo film is going to have difficulty in showing his weakness. But Ray Fisher plays the role so well and his interactions with his father Dr Stone are so realistic (credit to Joe Morton who has a significant role in this film). There is angst and regret and also later some redemption - Ray Fisher and Joe Morton absolutely nail the absent parent and overachieving child dynamic. The Flash is the comic relief and some of his scenes that are in Whedon's version are included but not all. Thankfully we're spared his awful running style (Phoebe from Friends comes to mind) in this version and his personality really shines through. This Batman is the best cinematic version of both Batman and Bruce Wayne that I have seen. Affleck nails the billionaire playboy attitude and also the brooding Batman perfectly. Superman is also equally incredible and my only complaint is that there's not enough of him - but obviously they have to resurrect him.The Motherbox storyline is going to have people comparing this to the Infinity Saga but this is its own story and not an imitation - there are similarities but this is treading it's own path. The updated version of the battle with Darkseid versus Zeusnand the old Gods, Amazon's, Atlanteans, men and Green Lanterns was incredible and I could watch this for hours. This and Themyscira deserves its own prequel film.Some spoilers - the scenes with Desaad and Darkseid are great! I want to see more of Apokolips! I want to see more of the Knightmare future and what happens with how they reach that position and how they correct it. Joker and Batman's conversation at the end is brilliant and feels like it's taken straight from the pages of a comic book. Martian Manhunters look is also very comic accurate and I hope we can see more of him again in the future. Same goes for Ryan Choi as The Atom - now that he's head of Star Labs NanoTech division, he's definitely due a role in any potential sequel.Overall I watched this in an afternoon and took a few breaks as it is 4 hours. It didn't feel like 4 hours though and I wanted more. This feels like a story that I want to see more of and see it concluded properly. The future DC stories can easily flow from here without affecting continuity. Zach Snyder absolutely has to continue guiding the Justice League films and develop his story. On that note - after the final scene there is a cut to black with the message \"For Autumn\". This film was a labour of love for Snyder and his wife who lost their daughter to suicide before the film could be completed. There are some themes of parenting through the film - Cyborg and his father, Superman hearing both Jor-El and Jonathan Kent after his resurrection, Aquaman and his anger towards Atlantis for taking away his mother - that really brings a lot of heart and feelings into this film. This is something that was lacking in Whedons version. I'm glad that the Snyder's got a chance to complete the film and dedicate it to Autumn and I'm glad we all get the chance to see Snyder's amazing vision for these characters.TL; DR - quality film and absolutely worth watching!", "Master piece wonderful movie": "Finally the true vision of zack snyder is completed. This is the justice league movie we wanted and really needed. Great story extended character development with cyborg, flash and aquaman. Loved Cyborg's journey Flash was awesome meeting Iris. Aquaman hate towards atlantis before his movie was also awesome. The Nightmare scene left me wanting more because Darksied said we will travel in the form of the old ways too cool. Joker wow what a treat it was short but wow. At the end we need WB to #restorethesnyderverse and a solo Batman series or movie with our batfleck.", "Imagine if we had got this before Infinity War/Endgame. It would have been massive in 2017!!": "I cannot believe this was supposed to be released way back in 2017 and they chose not to. This movie is better than Whedon's 2017 version in every single aspect. EVERY SINGLE Aspect. He had made a 3h35min directors cut meant for blurays and wanted to release a 3h cut in the theaters. He had those cuts ready and had showed it to WB(with incomplete vfx and some music/temp music). WB told him to cut it down to 2hours. He made like 10 other shorter cuts, shortest being 2h20 mins, which would cut out so many plot points and character arcs, and make it make no sense, but WB still demanded it to be 2hours.Every character is way more fleshed out and you can understand they're motives and why they do the things they do in this movie. This movie is surprisingly lighter in tone, much more lighter than I expected. Steppenwolf, who was so bad in the 2017 version, is so much better in ZSJL. You can understand his motives, why he's on Earth, how he came to Earth and his motives that drive him forward. Even Darkseid, who I thought would just be a small cameo, his threat looms over the movie throughout.The sad thing is, this movie will currently be compared to a completely inferior film for quite sometime since there will be a lot of people who watched both versions. It is sometimes jarring to remember how it went in the 2017 version and how it goes in ZSJL.Cyborg's entire arc is different. Joss Whedon reshot Cyborg the most, I think every single scene except maybe one. Ray Fisher did a great job and you care for Cyborg and Victor Stone. The movie actually depends on Cyborg since he drives the plot.People were a bit worried about the CGI, but man, the CGI is done so well, for Cyborg, Steppenwolf, Darkseid etc. There might be a few scenes here and there that might look a bit odd due to the green screen, but that happens usually in all big block buster superhero movies. Not as egregious as the Black Panther final fight, or the floating heads of War Machine and Banner/Hulk Buster.Every single action sequence is longer and makes so much sense with what everyone does. Every character has a shining moment.Even though it was 4 hours long, it went by so quick for me. You just want to keep watching even though the movie has 6 chapters and an Epilogue. The pacing is very well done that you never look at the time or how much time is left in the movie. Even the slow moments keep you wanting to watch it, and it is mixed well with the faster paced action moments. By the time the credits started to roll, I just wanted so much more. I want them to make more movies that continue this story.Some minor things I can complain about is some music choices during some scenes. The music didn't match with some of the scenes and wished it was done a bit better. The overall music score is better, and the Justice League theme is so catchy.Zack Snyder could have easily made this a 3 hour version and released it in 2017. I cannot believe that WB decided to force the 2 hour mandate on him. I cannot believe the decisions that WB made. They butchered this movie and the DCEU connected universe by the decisions they made in 2017. I really hope that they let Zack Snyder continue this story, because it was leading to something so interesting and good.

This time around I cared about Cyborg and Flash where I didn't before. I now think that This was the best version of Batman.\nI finished excited about the future of DC. It hit hard when I realized that that future isn't likely to happen. Different Batman next time. Probably a different Superman. The upcoming Flash movie will probably not reference this JLA but that first one.\nPlease Warner Bros, allow this story to continue.

Snyder's cut has depth, action-packed, top-notch CGI, better character development, not to mention Steppenwolf's upgrade in armor and look was more baddass than Thanos or any other villain in recent past. The four+ hours did sound long initially but I did finish in one day-I have kids..

If you have any hesitation on watching this because of the original release, don't! This isn't even 1 percent of that junk they released a few years ago. I'm just glad the fans knew this cut needed to be released and we fought so hard to get it done!I hope Zack is able to see his vision out in the DCEU one way or another.

Had they just let Zac Snyder do his thing. What a shame.", "The Ultimate DC Super Hero Movie": "First thing, just forget that there was another Justice league.Coming to this movie, just one word to describe it EPIC. There is no comparison with the older one at all. When you watch this you feel this movie has a soul. Every character has a pourpose and motivation. Yes, I agree this movie is long but you have to admit the directors is tend to be little longer with added or bonus visuals. But if given a good editting this movie is 3 hour 20 minute adrenaline rush. A proper IMAX screen movie.What I liked\n1. Steppenwolf and his VFX is just on point. He looked and means business. His screen presense is just menecing.2. Wonderful story telling. They way Zack Snyder told his version of Justice league becomes the soul of the movie and as a audience you stay attached to the movie through out.3. Background Score. What a score. Just gives you chills.4. Feels like a totally new movie. I can say over 80% of the movie feels new and every scene that we saw in the theatrical version of the movie has so much more stuff attached to it.5. Zack Snyder. He is the soul of DC extended universe. After this movie I can not imagine any DC extended universe movie without Zacks vision behind it. This movie always has a greater picture and greater threat looming around and that's Darkseid. And you will absolutely love it when he comes on screen. And that where Zacks vision lies.What I did not like\n1. Run time is long. Could be crisper with a good editing.2. IMAX screen ratio. It's a pain watching while watching in smaller screens.3. A more powerful batman would have this exciting4. Some plot holes are there in the movie.5. Pace of the movie can be bit faster. Takes your time with long slow Mo shots.Best things in the movie:\n1.Darkseids first appearance\n2.Steppenwolf vs Amazons\n3.

This is what the fans expected to be and it is, it's a treat for them, for the general audience it's a worth a watch", "The DC Universe are back!": "Awesome movie! Lets not the Universe die! The DC is back !", "A Justice League film where all the awesome moments actually feel earned.": "I remember going to see the orginal version in theaters, then going to see it again for a second time. The first time I left the theater from watching it, I would have given it a 8 out of 10. The second time after leaving the theater, I would have given it a 3 out of 10. So much footage was edited differently, left on the cutting room floor originally. Zack Snyder truly did a beautiful job at assembling this film. All the new footage is  fantastic and there are some awesome surprises in store for fans for sure. After I finished watching the movie this morning, the more important moments, all the powerful emotional beats felt so much more earned because of the build-up surrounding them. Everyone gets their time to shine in the best possible way. Special note: Cyborg (Ray Fisher) totally steals the show. Phenomenal acting.", "Completed the theatrical version": "Things happened in the theatrical version that were unclear are finally explained in the Synder's cut.", "Snyder's 4th Masterpiece": "It was all i was waiting for, and synder knocked it out of the park, this movie for me is one of the greatest comic book movie ever made, and i want more JL, So let's RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE.\n#RESTORETHESYNDERVERSE", "The Justice League that we deserved!": "After seeing this film I really can't understand what makes some people (some WB executives) think that Joss Whedon's approach is better.. it's almost beyond logic, this film (ZSJL) had all the formula right; every character have their arc, brilliant understanding of each heroes and their alternate identity and most importantly a good knowledge of DC universe's stories and how to use them in this film plus many Easter eggs that would make any DC hardcore fan smile. The 4 hours duration managed to do what Marvel did with 4-6 films, ie. building the team of superheroes and their universe. As a happy fan obviously I need to know what'll happen next to this Justice League #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "A masterpiece through and through": "WB not going ahead with the rest of his vision is just plain dumb. #restorethesnyderverse", "The script writer should be fired!": "A nice movie, good acting, good shooting.\nAltough every sentence is repeated twice, really annoying. There is a poor flow of dialouge, properly bad. Some action scenes are also shabby/poor - could have been amazing if it wasnt made for little kids", "When LOVE beats bureaucracy!": "When you put LOVE in anything you do, the result is always something good! We can fell Snyder's love for the characters! That's why this version is so touching!\nThe first version is bureaucratic and cold, it is clearly the product of someone following the directions of WB executives and it is very clear now, how a man's vision could be eclipsed by bureaucracy!\nIt is the ultimate proof that when you follow your heart and do what you believe, when a film is done by who love the characters and knows exactly what to do, it is so espectacular and success is the only result possible!\nI hope it makes tons of money to show the executives that LOVE can result in much more profit than bureaucracy!", "Hands down the best comic book movie I've ever seen.": "Top notch story ,top notch acting, top notch effects and top notch musical score.this movie put me through the full range of emotions.if wb was smart they would go forward with this vision of the dceu one way or another.it honestly doesnt get any better than this.", "Comic book Movie DONE RIGHT!!!!": "After watching this 4 hour epic movie. I'm ready to watch the sequel. It's was that good. Zack synder director cut gave us a justice league movie that made you feel the comic book experience. All the characters had their great moments and even the villains had enough dialogue you began to understand their desires. Zack synder gave us a comic book movie DONE RIGHT!", "WB has no other way to stop this!": "The way Zack connects the already existing dots from the previous movies, introduction and characterization of the \"New Gods\", well, this has to be the perfect cut DC fans hoped for, for me it exceeded my expectations... This vision of Snyder has to come to existence... and WB will possibly have no excuses to say so otherwise. #Restorethesnyderverse", "This might not be perfect, but still.. deserves a 10. Coz it has heart.": "Much respect for this movie and ZS ! Anyone who has watched the theatrical cut, needs to see this original vision of zack, just once.", "A movie that can set the DCEU right on track": "A massive win to Zack Snyder for his years of work.The 2017 version was meh. There must be a character development between the heroes and Snyder handled it exceptionally. Warner Bros must realize this franchise should continue with Zack's involvement.A must watch movie for every Comic Book Fan, be it DC or Marvel or whatever company that is out there... Not just for Comic Book Fans, its a good family entertainer as well.", "Snyder Cut is on a completely different level": "This is the REAL Justice League movie we deserve. The character development is way better than the original theatrical cut. Batman, like in the comic book, is the real leader of the team, he believes the only way to save the world is unite the league, he shows confidence and determination in leading the team. The character build for Cyborg and The Flash is solid that, like Zack said, Cyborg is the heart of this film, and The Flash sequence in the final battle is so epic, which I believe it is the best sequence in comic book movie so far. Even Steppenwolf possesses a reasonable purpose of his actions, making him a real threat in this film. Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely one of the best comic book movies in history, hope we can see more of his visions and expansion of the Snyder-verse in the future. #RestoreThe SnyderVerse.", "Movie of the Year 2021": "Snyder Cut is epic. A phenomenal masterpiece. The characters' build up is solid, which makes them more like a league instead of a group of individuals in the original theatre cut. For instance, origins of cyborg is truely the heart of the story, and what surprised me is the Flash, his performance in the final battle is just epic. And Ben once again showed us he is the Batman we deserve, he was filled with hope and confidence which he lead the team in the right direction, a real leader, classic Batman in the Justice League. \"The time is now\", like it is said in the movie #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Finally!!!!!": "We finally get to see the vision that Zack had for us all along. After the 3rd viewing I have to say it doesn't disappoint. Is it a perfect film? No. But it is highly entertaining and far cry from whatever WB gave us in 2017. I hope this leads to the restoration of the Snyderverse. If you are looking for a marvel type movie this is not for you.", "Snyderverse Needs to Be Restored": "Last time I checked the rating of this movie was on 8.6 which implies the simplest fact that some negative reviews were what brought it down. I know one review might not help save anything. But for me Snydercut is redemption.What is redemption ?A journey from Flash being portrayed what he isn't (2017) to showing the hand to the destruction with Junkie XL's wonderful music.A journey from Batman smiling multiple times (he shouldn't) to using satellites, being honourable, motivating Flash to sharing those few minutes with Joker which makes you wonder what could've been.A journey from Superman having this oversized jaw (again 2017) which in turn destroys his face to donning the Black Suit, showing the sun he's back and humiliating Steppenwolf in front of his master.And oh Cyborg... The melancholic symphony that plays introducing the goddamn fandom to his pain. Nobody knew how Cyborg felt, but then Zack Snyder happened. And then us noticing how pivotal he was to him having that conversation with the Motherbox and telling it he's not alone.Wonder Woman was never this strong in the theatrical cut in this movie though without Superman ? WW hands down is the leader and Zack portrayed her how she was supposed to be portrayed. That slicing of his head at the end.... that's what WW is about \"Ruthlessness\". This Wonder Woman is very very strong.Aquaman... he was good back then but here he was something else. That trio of him, Cyborg and Flash..... that's what we needed where three of them showed what it is like to have friends to have people support you. Aquaman in this movie is friendship personified. Not denying the badass move where he holds his own in air against three parademons, to making a superhero landing from the broken building, to doing Superman a favor by pushing that trident through Steppenwolf.#RestoreTheSnyderVerse.", "Unlike most 1-star reviews, this one is honest": "Zack Snyder, with his vindicated 4-hour, restored director's cut, proves that it takes an extraordinary skillset and a colossal vision to direct a great comic-book movie, especially one of this calibre, with breathtaking visual-effects, a captivating, multi-layered story and pace, and with carefully fleshed out characters. It's one of the few CBMs that have caused ripples in the superhero industry, and it will take its throne amongst the pantheon of superhero movies, like THE DARK KNIGHT, BLACK PANTHER, AVENGERS ENDGAME, and of course BATMAN v SUPERMAN (Ultimate Edition).The movie transcends the grand and immersive experience because it shows you, from very early on, that it has a beating heart of emotion at its vast core. This emotion primarily exposes itself through the backstory of the heroes, but also their evolving, deep camaraderie, their overwhelming responsibility to the world, and even in that honest fear of situations going pear-shaped if measures aren't taken and plans aren't carried out. It uses the bones of the conventional we-are-heroes-trying-to-stop-a-villain-who-wants-absolute power-and-destruction but it adds muscle fibres of ominous fairy-tale wonder and mythology to flesh out something more grounded, important, serious, and its organs are these god-like heroes, who have very human feelings, very human lives, and they've got everything to lose if they don't unite against the looming threat of a cosmic evil, Darkseid, and his questionably loyal henchman, Steppenwolf. But what is cleverly exposed in these heroes is their vulnerability. Yes, they're godlike to every mortal, but they have limitations and weaknesses, and there's the ever-present knowledge that without Superman, they won't be able to save the world. And this is where the plot shoots off into its own subplot: Superman's resurrection. Unlike the meagre gathering of rushed scenes we saw in 2017, Superman's resurrection takes its time. This subplot is a startling journey, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.The Flash (Ezra Miller) is now introduced as a character you can invest in, not someone you so easily look over, as in 2017's JL where he's portrayed as a wisecracking goofball than just 'pushes people and runs'. His lightning-speed character is introduced in a mesmerising, slo-mo scene where he himself is also mesmerised by a young woman he saves from a car accident.Jason Momoa's backstory is very touch-and-go, but only because it was thoroughly explored in his Aquaman movie, and therefore a repeat would certainly feel redundant. His wisecracks are toned down a lot, since The Flash takes on that onus, but his surfer-dude vibe and become-a-hero-reluctance make him exceptionally likeable.Gal Gadot's Diana/Wonder Woman starkly contrasts what we saw in WW84, but brings back the heroine as we saw her (and admittedly fell in love with) in Wonder Woman (2017). She's Batman's voice of reason and pillar of strength, and her fierce warrior spirit really shines when her sword and shield are called for.Ben Affleck's Batman is almost similar to the one we saw in BvS. Almost. Gone are his trepidations and stereotypes of Superman, and although he's still got the gruff voice and stoic bearing that makes Batman Batman, his soul feels lighter, his demons cleansed to some extent, because now he's driven by a noble cause.Ray Fisher's Cyborg is perhaps the character you might feel drawn to the most, only because in Josstice League he was just a CGI decoration slipping from one scene to the next, offering minimal dialogue and proving, in terms of heroic competence, subpar. In ZSJL, we explore the backstory of what made him half machine, the reason behind the overbearing loss he feels and why his relationship with his father is on the rocks. Seeing himself as a monster and his powers as a curse, he goes on a tear-inducing journey of discovering that it's actually the opposite and embracing it.And last but not least, Henry Cavill's Superman. Sadly, his character doesn't receive the same amount of screen time, but ... I mean ... the guy was in a coffin. But his resurrection, his mental journey of rediscovering his identity, reuniting with Lois and Martha, and his overwhelming drive to do good, really make up for that absence. With heroes and a world in dire need, literally shoots back into the iconic, virtuous hero Superman was always meant to symbolise.Clever humour now replaces the Avengers humour of glib and teen comebacks. Dialogue feels natural, with no silence-fillers or needless small-talk (unless it's for characterisation) and it's clear that the script was carefully thought of, with a patter of gravitas and urgency behind every sentence. Although Avengers Endgame is still one of my favourite CBMs, ZSJL exposes AE's desperate accumulation of A-lister actors to be put in the same room as each other and read a script that, although full of humour and plot-ploughing sentences, doesn't feel it had enough TLC or heart poured into it. When you overflow a movie, or scene, with big names whose net worth amounts into the billions territory, you're making less of an impact than intended because you'll inevitably manage to push some into the spotlight and others into shadows. ZSJL has a healthy amount of big names and emerging stars, each with equal screen time. And the 4 hours runtime gives each one the opportunity to shine.Careful pace in between action lets you have everything in measured doses, rather than blow-up-in-your face action sequences that are there just there for the thrill of it and add very little to the story. It's certainly dark (Hey, it's a Snyder film) but it breaks up the dark and gritty shots with more colourful scenes, more than I expected it would, and it's pretty much on par with Avengers Endgame in terms of light/dark scenes ratio, although now AE seems to throb with extravagance and multi-million budgets dumped on VFX to appease more the retinas than the soul.ZSJL is not audience-friendly, but it's a cosmic feast for the eyes and emotionally filling.ZSJL is not the corporate-pleasing hasty botch job that Josstice League was, which, embarrassingly and karmically, ended up pleasing fewer people than intended, but a monument, and it majestically represents a parallel universe where WB hadn't been so easily intimidated by Marvel, hadn't pandered to the bribed 'film critics' (still in Marvel's pocket), hadn't chosen the PG sect of its audience over another, but had stuck to what it was good at: telling a good, emotional, soul-appeasing story. ZSJL represents the more glorious versions of Aquaman, Shazam, Wonder Woman 1984, and Suicide Squad, that what-could-have-been's of the superhero movie industry.ZSJL is escapism at an operating scale that you can't take your eyes off, accomplishing in 4 hours what other CBMs accomplished in a saga, and you spend the next day going over it in your mind like some awakening addiction. It leaves you with a yearning for more of that bravura and flair and grandeur, for the next part of the story left on the lips of a cliff-hanger.As for the ending ... this is probably one of the main reasons why ZSJL lingers in your mind, pestering your braincells. Earth's last remaining heroes, united with Earth's last remaining villains, the kind of situation that's very rarely explored in a superhero movie, or movies in general, but you know it's going to be a thrilling ride when it does. The cliff-hanger injects in your mind that something terrible will befall mankind, and it's down to a motley crew to save it.The bar has been set high.", "Waiting since 2016 for this, worth the wait": "A completely different experience to the 2017 release. New character arcs, fresh and consistent tone, strong acting all around and a truly worthy live action debut for the Justice League.A few music choices, lingering scenes and awkward choices holding back the score, but believe me when I say I loved this movie through and through, and despite a few questionable choices it's an incredibly strong film with exactly the tone I've been missing from comic films since Snyder's last release.More MoS than BVS in tone, this felt like Snyder at his most Snyder-like yet also very reserved in other ways. An interesting experience regardless of your view on the director, and though the 4hr runtime was daunting, I found myself surprised how quickly things blew by. Though the start admittedly drags in a few scenes prior to Diana's discovery in the Shrine of the Amazon's, I never found myself bored, which could not be said of the dull 2017 release, a film which took me 3 sittings to get through on a recent rewatch.Finally, how much was repurposed for the 2017 cut? Well, a number of key scenes in the 2017 release were present, though much longer and with very notable differences. I've said a lot how the tone is different, but a big thing I noticed with this new film is how some scenes and humour that was left in from the original cut fell flat in the 2017 release, but with timing and tonal restructuring got a genuine laugh from me.All in all I genuinely think this movie has something for everyone, though not without its indulgent excess, and is the definitive way to watch the debut of the Justice League.", "Such a good movie!": "Great Job! Great movie and MCU finally had some competition!", "When the comics and cartoons become real": "This is it! What real and true fans have waited for, and how is it...? I laughed, I cried, i cheered and I was speechless. All I can say is I want more!!! DO YOU HEAR ME WARNER BROTHERS??? I ... WANT... MORE!!!!!!", "I Fu*king love it and enjoy it!": "Same as above, I love this original version everything!", "Damm yes!": "WB please get Zack Snyder all your money to do Justice Ligue part 2 and also Men of steel 2\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "Everything we needed it to be": "Everything we needed it to be. and Everything we wanted it to be.", "An Honest, Unbiased Review": "Let me start off with the fact that this action-epic is by far a MAJOR improvement from what we got back in 2017. I feel like the money I spent to watch that shit-show in IMAX is no longer a hole in my wallet.As a major fan of Snyder's work, I had high expectations for ZSJL after watching _Man of Steel_ and _Batman V Superman (Ultimate Edition)_ multiple times. While I loved the _Snyder Cut_, there were a few flaws which makes it far from the best CBM we've seen or even far from the best of Snyder's pieces.Runtime: The 4-hour runtime flew by - I'll be honest. But even then, I feel like a lot of it could've been cut down to around 3 hours or the initial 3 and a half-ish hours he originally had planned. While I appreciate coherency in the storyline, there were some unnecessary extra shots but hey, it's not the end of the world so the more minutes there, the more welcome.Score: Second thing I need to touch up on is the OST. As far as I'm aware, this was solely handled by JunkieXL (whereas the previous instalments were Hans Zimmer and HZ/JXL respectively). The one thing I genuinely felt this film was lacking was a score which gave me goosebumps the way MoS and BvS did. Don't get me wrong, there were some good soundtracks, but the overly-dramatised ones outweighed the good and sounded a bit lacklustre - especially the Tarzan-mating call soundtrack that played whenever WonderWoman did anything special. It got annoying after the first hearing. They should've stuck with the original WW theme.Storyline/Script: Zack and Chris were on a madness with this one. I fell in love with the writing and didn't cringe at all (apart from when watching Gal Gadot's terrible acting... \"KAL-EL NO!\" or \"I BELONG TO NO-ONE\"). The lines from Steppenwolf and minimal lines from Darkseid were heavenly and left goosebumps all over my body. Comedy was timed perfectly and overall it felt like a DCEU film.Visuals: Cinematography was absolutely beautiful. Well shot and framed. The only usual thing was the Knightmare sequence at the end of the film. It was very strangely shot with unusual close-ups. I'm not 100% sure but it might've been additional photography they did with the new budget given. CGI for the most part was near enough flawless. Cyborg looked fantastic, as did Darkseid and Steppenwolf. The CGI locations could've looked better and the temperature for shots could've been a bit more vibrant - but that's just me being extra critical.All in all, the film was actually great. I don't like to wage war between the two universes so I say this as a fan of both MCU and DCEU: ZSJL ranks among the top 5 CBM's we have involving both cinematic universes. I've heard a lot of people say it's better than BvS but in my opinion, I don't think those people have watched the Ultimate Edition - because that film to me is the best, high-octane and grounded CBM we have.", "Justice League restored": "Felt like a whole new movie. Amazing. Zack Snyder nailed it.", "One of the Best Superhero Films ever made!": "The True version of the Justice League we should have gotten in 2017, This version is fantastic and Zack Snyder's vision is amazing. The film is incredibly paced the run time flew by. The Film is truly an experience, from the visuals to the music, Spfx, and editing it's a masterpiece of Superhero Cinema! The cast are all top notch especially Ray Fisher as Cyborg, his character is fully fleshed out and integral to the story and Mr. Fisher plays the part wonderfully. I will not go into a spoiler filled review, I will say if you haven't watched it, Ignore the Haters and do yourself a favor and do so now! Thank You Zack Snyder for such a terrific film.", "Redeemed Justice League.": "I stayed up till it dropped at 3 AM to watch a 4 hour movie and it was great. Almost perfect movie. It seemed that better takes were used for The Flash and Batman.", "The Justice League we wanted": "Look, the critics are just wrong.\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you it's a perfect movie, it isn't, but it's a movie that will please just about every DC fan out there.\nSteppenwolf is an actual character now. He has motivations. He doesn't look like a cartoon character. His eyes have emotion in them. His armor is bad ass.\nEvery Justice League hero has a backstory. Cyborg is a person now-not just a deus ex machina that shows up to mess around with the mother boxes.\nSpeaking of that-did you know what the mother boxes were from/what they did/how they got on Earth and why Steppenwolf showed up to get them? I didn't, before I watched the Snyder cut.\nThere is so much background and so much story that was cut from the original theatrical release that Snyder put back in, and the film is so much better for it.\nThe movie is long as hell, yes, and some stuff could have been left out and/or rearranged so that parts weren't quite so choppy, but overall, I'd consider those to be minor problems that don't affect the overall quality of the movie. Think of it as an extended Lord of the Rings-style thing.Also, Superman's nasty-ass CGI face from the beginning of the theatrical version is nowhere to be found. Thank God.", "Interesting idea, too long, original was better.": "Zac's concept was interesting but at over 4 hours long it was tough to keep my interest. The huge amount of exposition dumps may have brought more clarity to the overall story, and rounded out some of the character development but completely killed the pacing of the film. I was never bored watching the original version of the film. The last 5 minutes with the Joker in the alternate universe were really cool and potentially set up a great sequel but its not enough to save the film. I cannot believe he cut out the Superman funeral intro which was the emotional back drop to the whole film, and the change to the aquaman scene on the pier, again the original version with the white stripes song was punchy and cool.", "Worst piece of garbage ever": "A completely nonsensical movie.

Seriously what were WB and Whedon thinking in 2017? Zack Snyder made every hero shine bright in this movie, the characters interact with each other so well, in the final climax you can feel them working as a team. Zack just showed love for these comic book heroes like no one did before in cinema. There were certain emotional moments that almost made me tear up. Seriously, go watch it, no reviews, no spoilers, no critics, no haters, just you and the movie! Zack, you did it my friend! Perfect action, perfect characters, perfect depth, emotion and powerful scenes!", "Its a Completely different movie - Zack Snyder really understands the characters": "First of all It is a completely different movie to the one that was in the theatres. Its not even close.It's unbelievable that they have not gone with this version.There are no cringe dialogues from Batman and Wonderwoman, Aquaman is awesome, Flash and. Cyborg are the heart of the movie.You really understand Steppenwolf's motivations.Zack Snyder really understands these characters and set out to do Justice to them instead of just copying Marvel.Though it is 4hrs long it flows smoothly every scene having a meaning and impact with increased stakes and jaw dropping action sequences.This movie will no doubt be regarded as the one of the best comicbook movies of all time. It is undoubtedly Zack Snyder's best work.", "If a wait that long brings something like this, I'll wait again & again & again!!": "As the word 'business' latched itself with the word 'entertainment', we have seen the rise of quite a number of franchises in every mode and form of the popular culture. These franchises ranged from sports to graphic novels to music and so on and each had their own group of followers, supporters and enthusiasts. When the movie industry slowly but steadily made its own way away from the world of cinema, most of these franchises found a way to develop an outreach of such manner that was unprecedented in history. While almost all franchises jumped at the opportunity, the comic & graphic novel franchises were the ones who could utilize this opportunity the most. Because, unlike the franchises that were adopted from novels, lore, historic documents and such forms, the comic & graphic novel franchises had a recurring source of root materials.But there was an issue.While these franchises did reach a newer and broader audience with their movie adaptations; something went terribly wrong. Very few of the newer audience went exploring the source materials of the franchises - the actual comic issues, the story-lines and such.And so, gradually, instead of the root materials, the movie adaptations started shaping the primary public perception of these franchises and their content.\nAnd that, is where Zack Snyder's Justice League succeeds and fails at the same time. Contradicting I know, but allow me to explain.This version of Zack Snyder's Justice League was meant to solve the problematic issues of Whedon's disgraceful version released back in 2017. It did solve a lot, well, almost all of the problems, except one. The Batman! I have no clue why, but none of the directors in the last couple of decades seem to be able to capture the true scope of the character. In this case, Snyder shows us a Batman who is everything opposite of what the character actually is. It is significantly better in contrast to Whedon's Batman, but it is still grossly inaccurate.Batman is a human being who has pushed his every ability to their limit. He is severely rational and that leads up to him being the master strategist of the lot. Batman has a psychotic drive for vengeance which he himself keeps in check with indestructible moral codes and will power. His nature makes him perform at his best working alone but ends up leading the Justice League because there is no better tactician/strategist in the team.Instead of all that, Snyder gives us a human being, chasing meta-humans to recruit, jolly as the next guy, cracking jokes with flash, no sign of reason at all and acting out of FAITH! When you know Batman from the classic pieces like the animated series, JL Animated and uncountable comic issues, this seems nothing but sacrilege!The only thing Snyder got right about batman is how he sticks out like a sore thumb in this group, but still charges down inter-terrestrial beings like a bull with nothing but courage (well, and a few handy gadgets and toys \ud83d\ude1b ).\nAfter the release of Batman vs Superman, I was hopeful that at last someone is portraying Batman properly and the character could overcome the damage done by Christopher Nolan. But at least Nolan's Batman worked fabulously for his trilogy, Snyder hasn't been able to do even that!Apart from this and a few plot-holes here and there (why does Wonder Woman has to hang by the night crawler while she can fly?) the movie was a treat! Although Snyder failed Batman with his portrayal, he definitely nailed all the others; Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg and mostly Alfred! \ud83d\ude09\nBoth WW and Aquaman had their own solo movies. Wonder Woman had two. You would expect their character arc would already be developed and Snyder would have to build on it. But boy oh boy, Snyder develops the characters entirely on his own and in what style!Although the first one was fairly good, the latest WW movie was more like a chain-of-moving-pictures-slapped-together rather than a movie. It failed to uphold the true scope of the character which this movie does gracefully. In this Wonder Woman, Snyder rekindles her fiery and graceful spirit that is so fundamental of her character but was absent in the last solo movie.Aquaman was by far my most favorite depiction in this movie. Decades of making fun out of this character stopped to a halt when Jason Momoa was cast for this, and this is the movie that turns the table. Aurthur Curry is badass, he is the man of reason but most of all, he is the most humane among them. He is the one rational enough to be cautious in uncharted territories, refuses to act without proper info and most beautifully, he is the one to care for other's losses in the face of the Armageddon. The two-line conversation of him and Flash about care is the sweetest thing in the movie.That brings us to one of the dominant characteristic of this movie - The portrayal of crude emotions - and this is one of the things that makes the incredulous length of the film well worth of everything. Mostly channeled through the characters of Flash and Cyborg, the emotional elements naturally shape themselves around the context and conflict about family. The similar but yet distinct conflicts of two fathers give the character of Flash and Cyborg profound depth which in turn drives the movie.Although a lot of the fight scenes of the previous version were included, all the fight and battle sequences were dramatically better. Snyder did shoot a lot of new fight and battle sequences, but the reason all of it felt fabulous was the use of resplendent background music. And when all of this builds up to the climactic peak of the battle, it is bound to leave you energized.Another achievement of this movie is that it is very lenient and suitable for someone totally new to the world of DC. A basic characteristic of superhero movies now-a-days is continuity. You need to see this to understand that, that to realize this and so on. While this is not a bad thing for the franchises, it can be overwhelming for someone new. ZSJL despite having a continuity from BVS Dawn of Justice to Aquaman, it works very well as a stand-alone as well. I have seen loads of people complaining about the length of the movie, but this is what it achieves because of that.The nightmare sequence is rich in easter eggs and setting up the continuity, but it is the worst part of the whole movie if you consider it cinematically. The sequence is written poorly and each and everyone's acting is loose. But if you keep that aside, it was a big WTF moment for the whole DCEU. Clearly they are setting up the injustice story-line, but unlike the comic issue, it will be Darkseid rather than Joker to kill Lois. The event is also teased in Victor's vision.As far as teasing goes, the introduction of Ryan Choi of Atom took me by surprise. In fact, I did not notice it the first time. But it seems Zack had or maybe still has a grander vision for the whole platoon of Justice League. With the introduction of Martian Manhunter, the classic Justice League lineup is just short of Green Lantern. If there is going to be a Snyderverse, I am all for it.\n-------------------\nAfter his resurrection, Superman says \"I have a second chance Lo. I am not gonna waste it.\"\nWell, you didn't Zack. \u2764", "10/10, A Phenomenal Epic": "I finished Zack Snyder's Justice League and immediately just thought about how happy I was to finally be able to experience this film, and trust me, this is an incredible experience. After I watched it, I sat and thought about it for an hour, then skimmed through the movie afterwards but found myself just rewatching the movie. It really is a masterpiece. And I loved every minute of it. Zack outdid himself with this one. Created a universe and expanded on it. This film is a superhero epic and dare I say damn near perfect. ZSJL is a goldmine for DC and a HUGE missed opportunity if they don't expand on this. This film is one for the books and it wouldn't have happened without the fans. We got this out, let's get JL2 and 3 made. Im grateful for this movie and I'm grateful for Zack Snyder and everyone who has supported him and this movie.\n#ThankyouZackSnyder", "the Justice that we deserve": "The cut is awesome, all the movie is in context, the fight cenes are badass, the time screen of each hero was essential for his development and the superman is now a god that he deserve to be. oh, we cant forget bout flash! he was incredible!!!\nand for the people that keep talking bout how long it takes, u cant forget that initial ideia was to divide in parts.\nAre u satisfied Zack? now we want a part 2 of this. \ud83e\udd1d", "Four hours would make any movie better": "Yes, this movie is better in as much that it makes sense. But four hours? Russian novel movies make sense at four hours.", "True master piece by Snyder": "Goes to show how Imcompetent some of these WB executives are that they hired amateur Whedon and ruined Snyder's vision. Wish I could erase that 2017 version off my memory. Snyder's Justice league gave me goosebumps even after seeing the edited version few years ago.....We all need to come together and push for the Justice League 2 which will realize the vision of Snyder once and for all.", "Continue the SnyderVerse!": "I love it through and through. Have to admit there was too much slow motion but everything else was perfect. Please make this cannon and continue with a sequel!!!", "AWESOME! MASTERPIECE!": "Extraordinary movie! It's like Zack Snyder went around the world like Christopher Reeve's Superman to go back in time and delete that damn Joss Whedon to replace it with this masterpiece! The Wonder Woman scene from the beginning already puts the 2017 movie in the trash!\nHere the characters have more plots, more contexts, the film has more violence, more heroism, more epic scenes, Darkseid appearances, real threats, a  final ending and total valorization of the DC Universe, giving excellent scenes to the characters! Wonder Woman steals scenes, the Flash is  here, having a BIG influence on the plot, Batman from Ben Affleck is OBVIOUSly the best Batman in the cinema, the only one who has no film supporting the villain more than himself, the Cyborg is AMAZING ! WELL BETTER THAN THE FIRST MOVIE! I want that actor back!\nI like Marvel movies a lot, but it's one thing to like and be enthusiastic, it's another thing to be a teenage warden supported by a father and mother addicted to the \"quarrel\" of publishers on the internet. The person who, instead of expressing his opinion, plays lies to defame some production, is at least a scoundrel, or just hasn't left his youth yet.\nThis is the definitive version of the Justice League, and I want more! The ending opens the door to incredible sequels in the right hands! The film has epic proportions and did not need 20 films to reach the peak! Imagine if the guys invest in the sequences!", "Better. Still a cluttered mess.": "Still awful. Rated the original a 2. This was better, but the original would have been just as good, if it was allowed to be 4 hours long. Most of the new additions, especially the last half hour (Epilogue) added nothing to the story, except to throw another character in there to get fans excited. Dark Seid was a huge tease.", "Bad story with poor execution.": "Repeated story with very poor execution, 5 star for graphics and i like the idea for 4 hour movies.", "This is what DC is": "This is what everyone was expecting.\nA magnificent and mesmerising piece of true art.I starts with the end of Superman leaving a void in humanity and ends with what Unity and Justice if mighty stands together.Story narrates every character at his best and sets a theme that evolves within itself and compel every soul.", "You did not disappoint sir Zack Snyder": "You've proved your work/ passion/ and love for DC and all the correctors! You're the best!!!", "Superb Improvement": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is a superb improvement over its predecessor. Almost all aspect of the movie was improved upon, particularly the addition of Cyborg's backstory and the removal of forced jokes from the 2017 version. It ends off with a big cliff hanger leaving you wanting more however I do find that ZS could have toned down the use of slow-mo for some of the scenes.", "A Homeric masterpiece": "This movie is the closet thing we will get to an audiovisual postmodern version of the Illiad. Zack Snyder is truly a genius artist, he does not make movies for studios to profit, but movies that act like a work of art.\nThank you Zack Snyder! Thank you all of those who fought for the Snydercut! We won!", "Justice Has Been Served!": "Redemption time for the great Zack Snyder and his vision for this first DCEU arc. No spoilers here, i want to keep the magic on for those who haven't seen the cut yet. What we experienced in 2017.. well, personally i was waiting for those Cyborg scenes from the very early trailers.... and poof gone! None of that was in the infamous Whedon cut. Seriously as a huge DC fan, it was very rewarding to see the true essence of characters like The Flash and Cyborg who pretty much didn't exist in 2017. So that combined with Zack Snyder's visuals which are on a different plane, is a recipe for greatness. I believe this cut has the perfectly balanced tone between character deepness and humor. Seriously man if you're reading this, and haven't seen the movie...life is short! GO.", "Outstanding and epic": "This film just blows the 2017 cut out of the water. It's so much more grand and powerful. All the characters have more time to develop and showcase their powers. Gone is the petty arguments and baiting from the first cut and in its place is reason and discussion. My only criticism is that you could have trimmed this film down with some tighter editing and not lost out on any plot development. Overall a fantastic film.", "Doesn't even compare to the 2017": "Love it, now I want more. Some Vfx were poor, but the storyline was a fulfillment for my soul.", "Brilliant movie exactly what the original justice league should have been..": "Brilliant movie from start to finish. The movie we deserved originally. We need the Snyder verse restored.", "Forget the 2017 movie. This is the real JL movie we deserved": "As a fan of DC comics I was not impressed with what we got in 2017. Like most I felt that the pace and story line felt rushed and little to no time out into building up new characters we were being introduced to for the first time. The villian didn't even feel like a real threat and the \"humor\" was forced. I like a dark superhero movie and that's one of the main reasons I prefer Snyder's take on comics books movies over DC/Marvel movies. This Snyder Cut delivered on everything and the best part was that it felt like I was watching a brand new movie, right from the start. I now actually cared about Cyborg and the Flash, plus the main villain was actually bad ass a felt like a real threat that warranted assembling a team for. Without going to much into it, by the end of the movie I had a huge grin on my face and I can honestly say this was one of the best movies (not just superhero movies) that I have watched in a few years. An amazing score by Junkie XL mixed with a story line that actually makes sense now and we were left with a satisfying movie that pleased both visually and emotionally. It hurts to think we won't get to see where this story was going but if #releasethesnydercut has taught us anything, it's that of enough people want it to be made then there is always a chance. Thank you Zack for doing this and bringing justice to the Justice League \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "SUPERB MOVIE": "ONE OF THE BEST DC MOVIES THEY HAVE DONE. Snyder cut is way superior to the original one, more meaning to the characters and the developments and visuals just hand ups amazing", "Much More Real": "Although it still not a completed movie(CGI) it is more movie than the wedon's. Good fight scenes quite better story more real quotes. I prefer this 10 times more than the first one. I wish we can watch this in theater. CGI would be awesome. Lets hope on JL2", "Finally it all makes sense!": "I can't believe how much was missing in the original cut. Everything comes together in this masterpiece. The whole storyline makes total sense now. A couple of scenes could be left out, reducing the total length, but, if you can endure it, you won't regret it. And that black suit... quite a reference to the comic books.", "Amazing beyond any othe hero film": "This was not just a comic book film it was an incredible storytelling piece of art", "This was more than I expected.": "Thank you Zack for this move. I know 4hrs is long but hey same when binging 21 episode in one day. Movie took it's time to show it's characters loved the story of cyborg. And flash he still cracks me up every time. Although superman had less screen time we really saw a good superman fight. I would really love to see a Sequel from Zack Snyder.", "Had no hopes for this...": "I was so disappointed in the Joss Whedon cut of Justice League that I couldn't see how Znyder would be able to turn it into both a watchable and enjoyable experience, but I'm so glad I was proven wrong. I absolutely loved it. The new scenes flesh out the characters much more and thankfully all the dumb jokes have been left out. It's obviously a lot longer than before, but it's cut into six different parts so those not willing to sit through it in one sitting can make a week of it instead. The special effects are still iffy in places but overall it's not something that will pull you out of the movie. If you've seen the first one and left disappointed then you owe it to yourself to see this version. I promise it will make it up to you.", "God damn": "It's beautiful from our maestro snyder\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dmake me cry and angry why not #restorethesnyderverse to make another move jl 2 maybe plz At&t and WB #restorethesnyderverse", "Bonafide Fan Service": "For every marvel movie I saw, I was satisfied with the ending, only exception being Infinity War, but Justice league even at almost 4 hours, I want more, one of the best 4hrs spent in my life.", "Epic journey": "The characters are better developed here. It creates more empathy towards their personal background and motivations. There is a sense of threat much higher than in the original and action scenes of each hero is way more awesome.", "Thank Zack": "Zack I want to thank for this film, you deliver the best of DC comics, I really enjoy this film and is better of that crap that I saw in 2017. WB should erase the 2017 version from the existence of the earth.", "Tedious self-indulgence": "Love a superhero movie - but this is just bloatware. It's a shame, because like many, I've been waiting a while for this.But honestly? I'll take the 2017 version. Sure, it had flaws - but slow and shambling wasn't one of them. It's like watching the original, with all the bits they cut out because of pacing.He could have made a great movie, by cutting an hour off, but decided instead to merely appeal to those few who know the Klingon language and still live with their mothers.", "Snyder's Trademark": "Snyder is really good with his vision, the storyline is so detailed and the action scenes are a major upgrade compared to Joss Whedon.", "Greatest comic book movie in the history of comic book movies.": "Normally with that runtime it would have been drag, but this movie felt like I still haven't seen enough!

It has connected storyline with divided chapters. Some part of movie is still comes from the first version, but have been strongly improved. The only thing that I find lacking is the storyline itself. They could have put something unexpected like MCU did in the avengers. The last chapter also seems like they are working on new parts of it and will be continued, which I believe is going to be even interesting than this first part. Overall great movie and would suggest everyone fan of DC to watch.P.S. I had lost all my respect for Wonder Woman because of her last movies, but Zack brought it back :)", "That's what we needed": "Snyder did a great job. This JL contains all the background information that were missing in the first attempt. Even though the movie is about four hours long, It does not contain any part that is redundant.\nHowever, Snyder used slowmotion scenes quite frequently which may be one reason for the extraordinary running time.", "The justice league movie we asked for and it was more than we could hope for": "This is the movie that should have been released. Great story , compelling . Great soundtrack . I don't care about the aspect ratio . Didn't bother me after 10 seconds because the movie sucks you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat untill the credits roll. Bravo Zack bravo. A perfect movie adaptation doesn't exist but I'll be damned this one gets real close .", "Best of DC. We hope for part 2": "The storyline was great. 1000x Better than the Josstice League. All of the main heroes were given justice.", "So happy Snyder finished this movie": "Excellent, everything was so exiting thru a little long of a movie, but awesome all the super heroes look so cool in this movie.", "I hate when people do this...": "Why actress who is almost 50 years old plays Lois Lane??? Clark Kent is about 30 years old...Henry Cavill can pass. Not so much is noticed, but Amy Adams shows that she is much older ...", "Putting DC right back on track!!": "Overly long due to a significantly unnecessary amount of slow motion scenes but the movie in general - MIND BLOWINGLY AMAZING!! The abysmal 2017 Justice League will be forgotten in no time!Did Steppenwolf a lot more good and Flash's powers are portrayed ever so superbly! Couldn't have improved the movie anymore even if the tried but definitely worth the 4 time regardless", "Best version": "I am a huge fan of the DCEU. ZSJL is a masterpiece and we surely want more of that. Kudos to Zack Snyder and the Fan's who fought for it and brought it to us.", "WE NEED A SEQUEL!!!": "This is one of the best super hero movies of all time. All the characters have depth and have a purpose in the film. The climax and the epilogue was brilliantly shot and acted. The action was top notch and once you watch the movie you will be hyped to see the sequels!!", "Improvement on previous film. Too long.": "More character development for Cyborg was given and the Themyscira action scene did justice to the Amazonian's strength and fighting prowess in a way that the Whedon version didn't achieve. The resolution of the main conflict was a better display of teamwork and the hero's individual abilities than many team-up movies have been able to achieve.This movie was 4 hours for a story that could have been 2.5 hours or 3. For me, this resulted in every minute of its 4 hour runtime being felt and I found myself checking the progress bar repeatedly throughout the movie. I could not imagine enjoying sitting through this movie in a theater setting.Zach Snyder's signature style of muted tones and overuse of Slow-Mo are present throughout this movie and the shots throughout are beautifully staged. The slow-mo only adds to the pacing issues in this movie, especially in the first half. This film feels like pieces of several excellent films that have been rushed into an adjoining universe before the ideas were fully fleshed out.Superman of the Snyder Universe has suffered from uneven storytelling. We watch him reveal himself to the world in Man of Steel, then he spends the runtime of Batman v. Superman unsure of who he is or what he stands for. While this is classic character development, it is a significant departure from previous theatrical versions of the character. His death at the end of the previous film halted that story arc and we don't have time in this movie to fully acclimate to where his character is now that he has returned. The other characters suffer similar struggles in their stories.Overall a good film but it is not a film that is enjoyable for me due to the crowded subject matter and long runtime. Casual viewers of the DC movies will find things to enjoy but may struggle to get past the extended runtime. I recommend that viewers take advantage of the parts that have been built in to the movie and use them as stopping points to take a break.", "Elevates the genre to soaring heights.": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is perfect in every way. It's The Lord of the Rings of the superhero genre. It's a masterpiece, a work of art, and a complete game changer.", "Best Comic book movie": "A classic Zack Snyder's art,This film is everything that a DC fan ever dreamed of . Visually stunning and narratively satisfying from start to finish, it is not just best DCEU film of all time but also one of the best superhero film of all time...Joss whedon should be burned alive for butchering this masterpiece and ruining Snyder's vision in 2017..But true fans loves Snyder's epic vision for DCEU that's why they called out for this film in after whedon's disaster..Zack snyder delivered a perfect superhero film here,filled with some of the best visuals ever seen in a movie, eye popping effects, stunning cinematography, eargasmic soundtrack by junkie XL and breathtaking action scenes ZSJL is everything you ever hoped for and even more then it looks initially..This film proved again that Ben affleck and Henry cavill are best Batman and Superman of all time..Jared Leto as joker steals the show, steppenwolf is monster looking warrior from other world who just wants to invade earth for his own personal reasons, darkseid is an evil tyrant lurking in shadows of different side of universe..This film also works as an origin story for cyborg, he is struggling to find his place in the world torn apart between his human and mechanical identity... Batman became a hero again after spending years in rage and hate ,here he is a hero and leader who is honouring Superman after his death via defending this world, the killer vengeful version from BvS is long gone.. wonder woman is helping humanity and continuing her duty to defend the world.. flash is trying to be a hero who wants to help people and still learning about his powers...aquaman is also struggling between his human life and atlantean heritage as a king, and finally heart and soul of DC Superman...In mos we've seen an alien trying to find his place in the world,in BvS we've seen a conflicted hero who is struggling and finding how to be a hero.but in ZSJL we've seen a true Superman who finally became a hero and ultimate protector of earth .An ideal to strive towards...Even side characters like Lois,Martha,Silas,desaad,martian manhunter, joker got small but meaningful part...At last I just want to say this is the movie we've been waiting for our life.... If you don't loved this movie don't call yourself as a DC fan.... It's time to restore the snyderverse now because without ZACK SNYDER and a complete JUSTICE LEAGUE TRILOGY DCEU is nothing and will fail soon again...Only a full snyderverse on HBO max can save DC now....", "Warner Bros, please continue Zack Snyder's vision.": "My first ever review and I would just like to ask Warner Bros to please continue with this storyline, this was 10x better than the original, and the characters felt so much more alive than they do in their individual movies.", "GR8T Movie! Total Entertainment": "Absolutely worth the wait and with the tight story telling, cinematography, score, and action pack, the 4 hours went by like a breeze. Zack needs to direct the next Wonder Woman and let's hope Zack can give us the sequel to the Justice Jeague. Thank you Zack Synder for your vision!", "Substance and style.": "Finally some character work and great pacing, an almost perfect movie that builds the universe without giving me wipelash like before.\nAlways will love Henry cavil as superman but the each of the cast feel like they have scenes they steal also feels very different to the last incarnation of the movie.\nThank you Zack Snyder.", "We Don't Live In A Society": "I thought this movie would make me like Justice League more, but instead did the opposite. It reminded me how much I dislike the DCEU. The CGI wasn't good. The acting wasn't great. And it just felt like a 4 hour long dud. It wouldn't have been better if it was broken out into separate episodes like Netfix did for the Hateful Eight Extended Cut. It took my 4 different sittings to get through it.Barry (Flash) I think was my favorite character, but mainly because I'm a sucker for comedy relief. I couldn't stand how he flared his arms out when running. It just looked silly.Superman just got nuts and is just a beast with his powers, while Aquaman man on the other hand my be the other end of the spectrum. He was maybe my least favorite character. In the end battle he doesn't \"Aquaman\", but instead is just a strong dude with a trident. He may as well not have even been a member of the Justice League.Cyborg was also a dreadful character. He was dull, and lacked anything likable. The only thing I liked was his backstory, and that's mainly because I too played high school school football. But they were really trying to force the fact that he's a \"good person\" because he hacked the school and changed his friend grade for her.Wonder Woman was also fine, but her dialogue when she was giving the history was soooooo long and it dragged on.And Batman....this might be the worst Batman I've seen on screen. Again, so dull. It's like these characters are fighting for Who's the Dullest Character award. He lacks all the charm and charisma that Christian Bale had in The Dark Knight. He says his super power is that \"he's rich\". Imagine the type of superhero Jeff Bazos could be?The Joker shows up, but not until the last 15 minutes of the film and just as fan service. HE DOESN'T EVEN SAY \"WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY\". If you're serving the fans you gotta have him say this! Come on Snyder!Lastly, why the 4:3 Aspect Ratio? When I started the movie there was literally a disclaimer saying, \"This movie is in 4:3 aspect ratio to preserve the integrity of Zack Synders creative vision.\" Just Zack, come on dude, it's a comic book movie that's serves fans for entertainment. Give them the most screen real estate for them. Most of the kids watching are probably on their iPads or iPhone anyways. But f you're going for \"Art\" just go all in and make it B&W. Heck why stop there, make it a silent film too.It entertained me. Got me to pop some popcorn. It did its job I suppose. Just overall was disappointed.", "No words": "Just a perfect movie. Probably among the two best superheroes films ever made.", "Worth every minute and every penny for subscribing to HBO max": "Just finished watching Justice League the Zack Snyder cut, and I will say it is a lot better than the theatrical release. I'm going to give a small review without giving away too much, but just in case SPOILERS ahead.Starting off, the aspect ratio of 4:3 kind of bothered me at first. Maybe it's because we're so spoiled with wide screens and such, but the sides felt cut off, but as I got sucked further into the movie it wasn't as noticeable.The movie seems almost completely different than the original, and the 4 hour long run time doesn't feel like it was that long. The enriched back stories on the characters introduced in this movie was nice.My main reason for watching this was to see the joker, and not surprisingly you have to stay to the very end to finally see him. I would love to see Jared Leto do his own joker movie. I think it would be better than the Joaquin joker movie which was more of a portrait of mental illness in the US than it was a movie about the joker.The movie definitely sets up sequels and spin offs and in the days where the MCU seems to rule the comic movie scene, if DC continues to follow up based off of Snyder's Justice League, they are going to be a major contender.The casting choices in this movie are 100% spot on and I'm definitely putting Affleck up there as one of the best Batman actors.The name escapes me, but the kid who played Barry Allen aka the Flash reminds me of a younger Justin Long, which I think is perfect.I would give this movie a 10/10 where as the theatrical release I'd probably only score it a 6/10.\nSo grab your popcorn, pre-order a meal, and definitely give Zack Snyder's Justice League a watch.", "Zack Snyder doesn't understand batman and superman": "So I watched this movie with an open mind, and I have to say it's definitely an improvement. There is more character development and you can clearly figure out each characters motivation. Cyborg and the Flash shine the most in this movie and I think it's pretty great, and the synergy between each member was greatly improved. There are no bad jokes and no creepy cgi superman mustache face. The addition of Martian Manhunter was really great along with the reveal that he was that General all along. However there are some bad things in this movie I am not gonna lie, and all of them revolve around Batman and Superman.Let's start with Batman, I think it was pretty great that he felt bad for what he did in BvS but even so, he is too damn good and friendly, he is Batman after all, and you are trying to tell me that batman, who in the comics and animated shows/movies had plans on how to defeat every member of the justice league, now just wants to build a team based on friendship and trust ??? Really ?? In the previous movie he killed people left and right, and I believe we all know how stupid it is to make batman a killer, and now he just want's to be friends with everyone ? And besides all that, since when does batman do batman work dressed as Bruce Wayne ? It's like he doesn't care if people find out who he is, no wonder Lex Luthor found out. The weird thing is that they are trying too damn hard to make him the next Iron-Man and it's really stupid. Zack Snyder even intended for him to die at the end so what the hell. Batman's story arc should not be about him dying at the end to protect someone/something he cares about, it should be about him learning to live his life without Batman. But no, Tony Stark died in the end and it made fans cry so we are going to kill our genius billionaire playboy as wellAnd with superman it's a whole different point so I am just gonna ask, SINCE WHEN DID LOIS LANE BECAME SO GOD DAMN IMPORTANT ? Lois Lane is not the only reason Clark Kent is superman, he helps people because he has the power to do so because he loves Earth it's his home, he is a chill ass dude not some god who views humanity beneath him. In the comics and animated series/movies of Justice League Lois Lane barely shows up, so why all of a sudden all the story is centered around her existence ? I fully believe if Lois died Superman would not go evil. And don't even think about Injustice that's a whole different point. In that story Lois died, Superman's unborn child died and the whole Metropolis was destroyed and it was Superman who did it because Joker drugged him. And now all of it is basically if Lois dies Superman will just nuke the world. Way to throw in the trash all character motivations Zack Snyder.Putting that aside I am really glad Zack Snyder is not the director anymore, when I read what were his plans for the future of DC I nearly puked, it is best that he walked out with an entertaining and fun to watch movie.P.S: Yes, as do all of you I imagine, I nearly puked every time Amber Heard was on screen.", "I havent had such fun for a long time!!!": "The definition of entertainment. Zack really did it! All the fights were perfect, the CGI was awesome and i couldnt get my eyes off. nice superheroes introduction , nice drama, nice action. everything was in perfect condition! I suggest you watch this movie with your friends and it will be the best night ever!", "A Glorious Masterpiece!": "This movie is a MASTERPIECE! Zack Snyder did an AMAZING job, the entire cast did a wonderful job bringing these characters back to life. Zack Snyder and the cast did JUSTICE to this film. I am definitely going to watch it again and again!", "Fire every executive/person responsible for keeping this from us": "This is the continuation of the story first laid out in Man of Steel and continued in Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition.

Yes it is, it is miles better and it is a masterpiece to be experienced and critiqued by one's self", "Epic Masterpiece!": "I consider myself a lover of all movies. My top three are 1. Unforgiven 2. Mad max fury road 3. BvS. So saying that I'm here to say that mad max and BvS have shifter out of the two and three slots and ZSJL is now number 2. And it's a close number one. I absolutely was blown away by this movie. It's dark beautiful deep detailed movie. It's EPIC. Easily best superhero movie and as I said #2 all time. I will die on this mountain and fight whoever disagrees. I enjoyed every second of this movie. I just can't believe they chopped this movie up and put out that 2017 joke version. This is a completely different movie. Shocking. Cause it's too bad we couldn't get snyder's version on the big screen. But I am happy we got it at all. Thank you zack snyder I'm so happy I was able to enjoy this film. MASTERPIECE!!!!!!", "it's just what was promised": "The film is self-supporting, the 4 hours blink and leaves you asking for more of the alternate reality. Flash and Cyborg, total redemption.", "Finally we see Zack Snyders VISION!": "Finally we see the original 5 movie arc vision Zack Snyder had for the DCEU. This movie shows the growth of the Justice League members and how they work together. All the heroes get their moments of spotlight. After every watch the movie seems to fly by and i personally didnt want it to end. Great watch and an amazing time, some laughs, tear jerking scenes, Superman back in all his glory.", "An absolute Masterpiece!": "ZSJL is awesome, epic, tragic & dramatic. Great action sequences, spectacular score and stunning visuals. It's by far the most fascinating and astonishing superhero movie. Obviously better than what we got in 2017.Yes, it is over 4 hours long but the runtime length stands justified for this movie. Really enjoyed it.#SnyderCut #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague #UsUnited", "Restore Snyderverse, Otherwise Boycott All WB movies.": "Restore Snyderverse, Otherwise Boycott All WB movies.", "This is the gift we all are wanting.": "So much impressive creation Zack Snyder.. And you desreved that appreciation.. Because you lift the entire dc's movies.. And now we want the sequel and return of green lantern only one thing is left we saw john at the end.. And we are wanting only ryan reynolds as green lantern for the sequel..\nSo much loved..", "What a comeback!": "Justice league 2017 is literally one of my least favorite and honestly most hated comic book film. I was dissapointed throughout. But we aren't watching this movie to rehash the past, Zach Synder was sitting on a goldmine. This version of Justice League is easily my favorite in the DCEU verse and one of the best comic films I've ever seen including MCU. Please please please watch it, and im sure you'll enjoy it. If 4 hours is too long its break points throughout the film that tell you what part your at, use those to take a breathe and bask in the awesomeness of this film lol.", "DON'T WATCH IT": "Should have left the first movie be. It's basically the same movie but longer and more flawed. The only cool addition is the Steppenwolf visual update and that we could see Darkseid (but not in action). If you have already seen 'Justice League' don't watch this one, it's just a 4 HOUR TRAILER FOR THE NEXT MOVIE.", "The One I Have Been Waiting For!!": "This is what DC has been missing. This is what me and every DC fan has been wanting out of this movie universe. I do not care for a second that it was 4 hours long! I would have watched 6 hours! Please for the love of all things good make a sequel!! Make Zack Snyder the head of the whole DCU!!", "Justice has been served!!!": "Zach snyder is the equivalent of superman when he gets brought back....only he can save this franchise and make them compete with marvel this is more than money this is about writing history and an unforgettable legacy", "Absolute BEST OF THE BEST!!!": "Best CBM of all time. 2nd to none... The visuals were brrathtaking, the music was amazing and much more.. THANK YOU SNYDER\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc #restorethesnyderverse", "This is Justice League": "I had no idea that the movie was going to be 4 hours long when I heard it was going to be a thing. When I saw it was, I was full on ready to jump into the deep end. I just finished it and what can I say? This is Justice League. Zack Snyder did a brilliant job in fleshing out every detail that was rushed in the original. This was made for the fans. It sets DC up with great start to what should be a great universe if they keep the momentum going. Hopefully, they don't fumble the ball. Zack Snyder is literally the best director for DC Stories. This was beautifully done!! Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie to wash your mind of the previous trash.", "Finally the movie as should be": "Finally the movie as should be , we waited 4 years for this moment", "All the right moves!": "Two minutes in this version was 10 times better than the original. Everything made sense. The color and tone matched the gravity and emotional resonance of the characters. The origin and motivation stories were fully told and follow on movies/characters meaningfully foreshadowed. Impossible feat that exceeded expectations. Should win academy awards for directing and editing alone. Put DC comics back in order for generations. Thank you to both Snyder's for this great gift out of their grief.", "that was masterpiece": "As a fan of comic books we all have been waiting for this unreleased cut of Zack Snyder's artwork that has been canceled due to his family tragedy. Since 2017 we did not get satisfied with Frankenstein Joss Whedon's cut that has many narrative issues in addition to the off vision of DC comics, which give us a lighter version of nihilistic and darker reality of Dc Comics univers with a jar of happy flours while la vie est belle song in the background. However we have mixed feelings with Zack Snyder's cut. In uncertainty of the next shift of the universe which leads us to the sad reality of that there is no continuation of this vision, and I will talk about this later.The thing which we like about DC is that there is no side joke and Marvel formula of making movies, what we love is the darkest tons and raw contern of philosophy that make us think about what if there is superhuman or half god living among us and questions about morals.\nAnd as we see in the joker character, the one who has no goal to accomplish only if he tests our morals and breaks down our fake reality. And other questions like Power and Law, But we Zack Snyder's movies brenk not only old philosophy but also greek mythology gods and art at once.\nWhich gives us art more than SuperHero movies from the music to screenplay and action. However, my problem is that I wish that I did not see the first Frankenstein Joss Whedon's cut, which was like a free spoiler, even though there is some change in main characters and plot as well in the new version. we see the vallen motivation but it was not the main focus for the movies, other blind characters get what they should have from arc development filed with emotion and the backstory of each which has complete movies.What we can say about the movie was better than we thought, and we need to see that sequel that shares the same vision.", "Give us one more!": "I would have loved to see this one in the cinema.\nGive us one more!", "Unquestionably superior": "Reading the other reviews, most has been said. THIS is without question the most satisfying and provoking version by far. Plot development is not rushed, character development has profound and meaningful depth without being pretentious. The other version has merit, but for a different (or indifferent) audience. Sorry Whedon, but you carved the previous version into a cookie cutter teen flick, and that might be just what the studio pushed you to do, but you could have done better...way better. Zack is to be commended on this incredible feat. We just finished a journey watching this, and are thankful for it. The closing score could not have been better.", "Snyder Post Mortem": "As it was when George Lucas gave birth to the Prequals, Zack Snyder has now given birth to the Porst Mortem!", "a must watch": "This whole movie connects every dot of the missing connections between the previously released dc movie and eagerly waiting for the second part", "#SNYDER.CUT": "WE WANT JUSTICE LEAGUE SEQUEL!\n#SNYDERJUSTICE2\nAll fans wants this to happen, this movie is perfection!", "A trully for Fan": "A little bit about Justice League Snyder.\nWell so, after many days of waiting for not only DC fans but also many fans of director Zack Snyder, the movie was released.The 4-hour movie with 6 parts has brought a much more complete story than the 2017 movie. I recommend that you should watch Batman vs Superman again to fully feel. about the film's vision.The biggest plus point of the movie is that the full storyline plus the main characters are built quite well and have more depth. We won't feel much about Sup and friends anymore. And of course the battle scenes of the characters are extremely eye-catching and epic (every scene gets goosebumps). With a long film length, it is possible to tell the audience more deeply about the character scene as well as the epic scenes (scenes of the ancient Earth vs Darksied are quite satisfying and detailed).\nSteppenwolf has been reshaped to look a lot stronger with bloody combat scenes. Although I don't really like Darksied's design, his appearances make the movie a lot more complete. Darksied feels a bit weak at the beginning. Batman in the film has really become the leader without a few fragments like the old version.The minus point of the film comes entirely from the film's difficult circumstances. The essence is that this is a 2017 movie which means there is absolutely no Aquaman (2018), so the way the characters of the Alantic characters in the film are not really familiar to the audience (partly because of the yellow film color) . And the movie is too long for a single viewing with plenty of redundant scenes challenging the patience of the viewer.If only the movie could be split into 6 separate episodes shown as a series in 2017, the movie could have been a lot better. Another biggest minus point is the abuse of slomotion scene. It's so dense of slow-motion shots that we feel like Barry Allen is running around in this movie. Makes the movie feel 5-6 hours long.The last minus point is the dialogue. Somehow the lines of the film are quite weird and sometimes a bit forced. And Allen's jokes didn't really pull the movie any brighter either.\nThe post-story scenes are quite pleasing to the fans and also try to show director Zack Snyder's vision for the second part of JL. But it is not centralized, but rather fragmentary.Overall, the movie is a party full of enough to please the fans, ending what was expected by the audience 4 years ago. But like the misery of the DC cinema universe. I feel the movie is no longer suitable at this time. When the vision of the DC universe is quite different from this version and then the characters are rebooted continuously.The film is still worthy of a work worth watching with respect for the merits of director Zack Snyder. This is also the director's gratitude to the fans after the long-awaited 4-year journey. And maybe Warner Bros. may later green light for JL 2 and we will wait for another super product to be born.", "Some stuff could still be better": "But overall, compared to the first JL, the ZSJL is by far, one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen! So bring on Zack Snyder for upcoming DC movies, i'm now sure he wont dissapoint. Well done!!", "DC needs Snyder": "WB needs to stop screwing around and give Snyder a contract. The whedon cut is trash and I can't believe WB thought that was a good idea. I watched this because I was all caught up with all my other shows and not really thinking I'd make it through the first hour... I was terribly mistaken and I am so glad I watched it.", "Must-see": "This movie nicely tells and intertwines all the little stories that lead to this point in the story. A perfect way of rewriting Superman into the existing story. The movie is even touching at some points. Needless to say that the visual effects are great. In short, must-see if you are into superhero films!", "I loved it!": "A Masterpiece! I could not ask for more. It is more than I expected!", "Pack a lunch.": "So to start.... it's really really long. That said though it's really really good. Much better than the theatrical release but I don't think people would have sat in a theatre for 4 hours. There were some scenes that probably were fine being cut like the theatrical version cut them but the story made better sense. Unfortunately, it left a sort of taste that probably won't ever get satisfied because who knows if they'll ever make the sequel this movie set up. Action was great. Batfleck was not the drunk he was made to be in the theatrical release. Would have liked to see a lantern or even the martian manhunter join the fight but it was nice to see them included.", "You should do more": "On of the best movies I watched for a while. TBH this is what I thought the first one would be, it covered everything we need to know and made so much more sense.", "At last a justice League movie worth watching": "Wow. I have seen 2017 movie and was way too much not at the same level. The feeling was what... what's this... What happened to superman face...what happened now...too many bad scenes not connected to each other.\nThe Snyder cut... Wow. Everything connected, the background stories, the \"why\" questions answered.. everything at the highest level of quality... The action... everything.\nThe justice League stories back on it's way to greatness", "Worth the wait and excitement": "The original from 2017 has left me very disappointed, could connect with the story and felt it was just made to make some money by adding all DC heroes. Zack Snyders cut just put this on a whole new level and give justice to this movie.Worth every minute of these 4 hours.", "Great movie, it was the movie we need it ....": "I gave it a 10, i did because, i love the movie and it was the movie we need it after BvS Dawn of justice. Love the character's development that set that emotional conection that we were missing and the amazing Cyborg origin story, the actor Ray's performance and the funny moments more control. Love that Batman felt like batman and that superman was truly a beast. Love the easter eggs. It was a master piece. I will love to see more. Zack Snyder you did great! Congrats! Thank you!", "1.5 Hours": "I'm 1.5 hours in and it's already so much better that the first JL. The depth Snyder went to introducing these new characters is so good. Also that battle with Darkseid was amazing. So far so good.", "Why 4-3 aspect ratio???": "Standard TV size these days is 1920x1080 (16-9) this is 1280x720 (4-3)...\nI am always annoyed that the movies these days are 1920x800 (Anamorphic) which is great for the theater or if you have a projection machine and screen to go with it. Otherwise everybody else at home is forced to watch movies with black bars at the top and bottom.For me to solve this, I have to rip the movie, load it into my video processing software, cut a little off the sides (losing video data) and then stretch it to the proper 1920x1080 (16-9) size to make it fit the TV screen completely.(The reason for cropping some off is so the people don't look stretched.)\nFor this one I am going to have to crop some off the top and bottom so the people don't look squashed.", "Everything I'd hoped it would be.": "I've wanted a good Justice League film since the 1990s, when I loved the cartoons. My excitement for the Josstice league was crushed by my disappointment. It was clear the film makers just hadn't understood the Batman character, Cyborg was barely worth being there, and the Flash was just childish. Not any more. Snyder's version is just a pleasure, from start to finish. The characters are understood, and explored. The plot exciting, with depth. And so many small details, music from the Superman and Wonder Woman films, cameos from many comic favourites, and more. The effects are great too, no wierd Superman expressions. I loved it, just loved it. Now I'm dreaming of such success for this film that Snyder is allowed to bring more of his DC visions to life.\nI didn't know her, but think Autumn would have been so proud.", "SNYDERVERSE NEEDS TO BE RESSURECTED AFTER THIS MASTERPIECE": "THIS MOVIE IS SO BEATIFULLY CRAFTED AND EDITED THAN EVERYONE WILL GIVE A STANDING OVATION AFTER ITS EPILOGUE PART\nNOW WE CAN SAY THAT MCU IS GOT AN EQUALLLY POWERFUL COMPETITOR", "What an epic movie!": "The movie is well paced, the characters have enough room to breathe, cyborg and the flash actually have story arcs and are essential to the plot.\nIt was a four hour movie and yet it left me wanting more", "In Snyder we trust": "Wow, loved the backstories to all the character's. Got rid of most of the cheesy scenes from the theatrical cut. Loved the darker tone of the movie. Can't give too much away but I really hope Zack does more DC movies and Warner Brothers just gets out of his way.", "Vision complete": "Awesome and a better version of the movie.characters given more depth especially the new characters introduced.flash, aquaman, cyborg.the start of dceu the way it should be.we the fans are speechless and in awe.great work zack, we've always got your back.he should be given the opportunity to finish his vision.dceu is here to stay. #Restorethesnyderverse", "One of The Best Comic book Superheroes movie of all time!!": "Oh man what a movie! Just watched it! Awesome storyline, Each character has a proper amount of screenplay. Way darker than the previous bull*hit! Steppenwolf was way way wayyy awesome.. & Darkseid... Oh mannnn... They really were united this time! Finally the justice league we deserved.", "The Justice League movie DC fans deserve": "I will admit after watching Man of Steel for the first time in 2013, I was disappointed. However, as the years have gone by, I've come to realize that Man of Steel is actually pretty good right up until it's messy final act, but Marvel movies also don't fare much better than a lot their movies' final acts either (I like both Marvel and DC).\nAnd I'm still not the biggest fan of Batman vs Superman, however I will say the Ultimate Edition is quite the improvement from the theatrical version.I know the DCEU has suffered from a lot of meddling from Warner Bros. executives and probably responsible for most of the early DCEU movies' flaws. And I am fully aware of their gross mistreatment of Zack Snyder, going behind his back after his daughter's death - hiring Joss Whedon to finish the movie. But I know now after watching Snyder's cut is that all Whedon did was butcher Zack's vision of what he wanted Justice League to be.\nI can confidently say that Snyder's cut is a much more satisfying experience than Whedon's cut.\nI think the only critiques I have is that maybe it is a little bit too long and that a few characters feel like they don't belong. However, the inclusion of Jared Leto's Joker is a very much welcome addition, and Leto's performance is a hundred times better than his performance in Suicide Squad.\nBen Affleck is once again great as Batman, and yeah he's my personal favorite Batman. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is flawless. But the characters I enjoyed the most are The Flash and Cyborg. The Flash scene when he saves Iris is probably the most beautifully directed scene I've seen in a superhero movie. The music, the cinematography, the VFX, the framing - that scene was just perfect in every way.\nI think Ray Fisher's casting as Cyborg is as perfect as Robert Downey Jr's casting as Iron Man. He's that good. It's such a damn shame that won't get a solo movie with him in the role. But after reading about the racist abuse he got from Whedon and WB executives during Justice League 2017's reshoots I completely understand why.\nThe only characters I find kind of lacking is Aquaman and Superman. I just think Aquaman could've had more to do. With Superman, I just think Henry Cavill's performance was kind of lacking. Apart from that though, this is the best showing of Superman in the DCEU so far.Steppenwolf and the Parademons are much more formidable threat than they where in 2017's Justice League, and a massive improvement in their design as well.\nOverall, Zack Snyder's Justice League has much more well-rounded plot, much better character development and far more entertaining action sequences.\nTo conclude, do I think the Snyderverse be restored? Yes, I absolutely do.", "The Justice League We Were Denied": "Excellent continuation from Snyder's previous films. Just because a couple of executives needed bonuses before the AT&T merger, both the fans and especially Zack Snyder were slighted and force fed a steaming pile of garbage that was the 2017 version aka Josstice League. WB should be ashamed of themselves. ZSJL was absolutely amazing. Let's keep going. Restore the Snyderverse!!!!", "WHAT A MASTERPIECE!": "WOW JUST WOW!\nThis movie is an amazing achievement!\nClearly my favourite superhero movie of all time!\nBig congrats to Zack!", "You want more of it!": "After 4 hours of watching i wantet more of it.

The snyder cut is all we could ever ask for.", "Every character actually has a personality": "This movie can stand to be trimmed around the edges, the 20 minute sequal bait dream sequence of an epilogue could stand to be cut, and the characters needs to react with a bit more urgency when confronted with dangerous situations, but otherwise this movie is pretty solid. I wouldn't recommend you watch it all in one sitting though, treat it as a miniseries and pace it out, else you'll feel pretty bloated afterwards. Those are my only complaints about this movie. Every character feels fleshed out and with an actual personality, the action scenes are fun, our heroes work together to fight the bad guy, they each have something to contribute to the team, and some sequences are done with some real and heavy creativity. I am pleasantly surprised that I liked this so much. Also Cyborg? Love Cyborg now.", "A very good one, quite opposite to the 2017 release": "Incredibly great movie. First of all, there is great connectivity between the Batman V Superman ending and start of this movie. Then, the antagonist actually looks like one. He looks like someone dark enough to be doing what he is doing and powerful enough to pick a fight like this. And also, now it makes sense what the hell are those mother boxes and now at least there is some logic and justification on why it can raise superman back. Even the heroes in this movie are not just poster boys but they all have the Zack Snyder touch where they have there own personalities and character. There is now a logic to how heroes are able to track the location of Steppenwolf in the end.Small elements like the superman's cry echoing through the world waking up mother boxes, silas's sacrifice, steppenwolf's hesitation when he faces wonder woman for the first time add so much meaning to the story. Loved the movie and wish there could be more of Snyder verse coming.", "This Is what should've been.": "I am speechless after watching Zack Snyder's Justice league. an easy 4 hours of epic story telling, beautifully crafted scenes, and a directors vision that we finally get to bask in.

The beginning feels they are feeling out what they should do and the end they hit their stride. Perfect movie it is not. However, it is wayyy better than the other one. The Josh movie made me hate DC. I would never have looked at another movie again.. Thank God I didn't have to watch WW2, but I jumped on this hype train and I'm 100 percent happy that I did. Well worth the 4 hrs.", "This is not just the greatest DCEU film, but also a masterpiece of a movie!": "Zack Snyder has knocked it out of park. This film makes me question the ridiculous decision making behind WBs theatrical version now tenfold! As far as I'm concerned, Zack Snyder's Justice League is canon and the theatrical version no longer exists. The story has been fully restored, with Chris Terrio's script having great dialogue and some surprisingly witty moments. Every main character now has an arc, with the character development and heart in this film being fantastic. Steppenwolf was actually threatening and you learn way more about his motivations and relationship with the DCEUs big bad Darkseid, who also has a sizeable role in this film. The action sequences are some of Zack Snyder's best. The visuals and CGI is sublime, every shot is like a painting! You don't even notice the film is 4 hours because of how effective the chapter titles are to pace the film! Special mention goes to Ray Fisher, his performance in this film was very emotional. Zack Snyder has created a Justice League movie worthy of its fans and cinema in general. Even those fans who did not like what he did with Man of Steel and BvS will certainly find many things to appreciate here. WB made an abomination of a mistake in 2017 to get rid of Zack Snyder's vision, because this cut beats the theatrical cut in every possible way. WB would be fools to not bring him back to finish the next two sequels. I want this story to continue and to see where it ends! Come on HBO Max, WarnerMedia and AT&T, you know what to do! #RestoreTheSnyderverse", "Zack Snyder is an Effing Genius": "This is literally the first review I've ever written. I've left quite a few scores but never actually commented, before now!\nI'm a huge fan of what Marvel have done and can honestly say Spider-Man is, for whatever reason, my favourite superhero of all time...followed closely by Batman!\nAnyway, I watched Man of Steel and enjoyed it as movies go; I then thought the Batman vs Superman film encapsulated the audiences' feelings regarding the utter destruction of the former film (secretly I was glad Batman kicked SM's ass). So, onto the Justice League debatable; what a crock of sh...ish-kebab! And I happen to like shish-kebab! It was woeful.\nLong, long story short...this new version is incredible! I watched the whole 4 hours in one sitting, even though I'd seen the previous 2 terrible hours, but it just made so much more sense and was so much more enjoyable! Everything worked! And the best thing about it is it has me wanting MORE!! Much MORE! A huge example of the whole situation is that I wasn't too crazy over Ben Affleck, now I love him...! He looked thin in the added extra scene! He'll be back in the gym now I hope? To conclude: old version, terrible. New version, amazing! And the fact Zack didn't let it die and came back on board shows just how much potential this franchise actually has.\nIf you were thinking of giving it a second chance...DO IT! You won't regret it!", "Thats the way to make heroes movies": "After a lot of comedy heroes movies we get one the way it should be.

Next with 2013 MAN OF STEEL and 2016 BvS:DAWN OF JUSTICE, again Director Zack Snyder proved his extraordinary vision about live action comics. He is indeed a diehard DC Fan.\n2017 Justice League was a disaster, by Director Joss Whedon and WB. I want that such idiots to know, enlighten yourselves, witness the epicness. This is how you beat racism, homophobia, and look at the feminism level of Zack Snyder, how epicly he put everything together. But idiots at WB are destroying with forced feminism, forced anti-racism, and forced pride movements in a very stupid radical way.In 2021, we just witnessed the epicness of a artwork. Zack Snyder's Justice League is a living example of the level of epicness that DC Comic can become.\nAs, I always say as a female I love the level of feminism he portrayed in his art. Wonder Woman, her mom like attitude to the league members and caring as much as how badass she is truly astonishing. I love the way Zack Snyder pulled out the warrior inside Diana Prince. Lois, Martha and Meera were wonderful within their screen time. Superman's screen time was quite the enough level. Batman's burden of responsibility, I felt that throughout the film. Hollywood this is what we, audience need. Live inside the artwork.\nLater, I am planning to give a full critical analysis of the movie. To me ZSJL is an epic artwork and living example of how astonishing live action COMIC could become.\nAt last all I wanna say to Warner Brothers and Media, Enlighten yourselves, and listen to us, the biggest FANDOME in the world. RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE.", "Spot on!": "This is Justice league. A four-hour epic movie about 6 people with their own problems coming together. Steppenwolf had a major upgrade, not only the costume design but also as a character. Darkseid is UNBELIEVABLE even in his small part. Now, for the JL. Flash and Cyborg steal the show as the team needs to come together, Aquaman has pretty much the same storyline, Batman also is a completely different character He unites the league and he also comes a long way since Batman V Superman. Wonder woman is not truly out yet, she's not fully prepared to join the world but she overcomes her doubts, she knows the strength of Darkseid.Superman finally sees his arc completed, he found out what he good do for the world and what his father's wanted him to achieve, which was basically the same thing. The final battle really is something else and the Nightmare Sequence leaves us at the edge of our seats.\nEven thought the OST is good, it's not really matching with the film, especially in the first two hours. The best parts of the OST was the already established music from Hans zimmer and the Flash theme. Pacing is great but the film sometimes feels tiring, it makes up for this but it could have been 20 minutes less. It's not boring, it never gets boring. It has other flaws but all in all, it's something we've all been waiting for and it really delivers.", "epic\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18": "Zack Snyder's Justice League is, simply put, an absolute brilliant film.

I'll keep it simple! This is epic in every way. Perfect balance and pacing explaining each characters struggles along with giving them a epic battle portraying their strengths. Even Batman was given some of the coolest action/fight scenes at the end that kept you in awwwwe. Not only does every superhero get his moment it made you feel like damn that was one of the coolest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. So long story short for a superhero film I'm giving this my top score and new favorite that it's the best I've seen yet. For a regular movie non superhero related I'll go with one of the most visually appealing stunning fun movies I've seen since Avatar", "He never fought us, not us united.": "The one true cut of the Justice League in it's all glory. The Justice League is basically a team of superheroes with godlike power and I always thought it's kinda hard to bring that essence in a live action yet Zack Snyder managed to bring their best and gave each and everyone time to shine. The flash and Cyborg were the MVP and heart of this movie for me but that doesn't outshine Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman. From Junkie XL's DCEU standard like score to Zack's signature visuals, everything about this movie is what the fans wished back in 2017. As a DC comics fans, it's truly a love letter. Please watch this and you'll get what's this hype is all about.\nOn final thought, #RestoreTheSnyderVerse", "Great Supehero Movies": "The storyline is very nice, easy to follow, the scoring is magnificent and well placed in every scene even though this film is 4 hours in duration but it doesn't feel ... WB should make DC films like, not have to follow the way of other production houses", "A Dream Come True": "After 3 long years of waiting finally we got to see the True Justice league. This version helped us understand our characters better specially cyborg amd flash. The sequence of MOS and BVW came to full realization with more of knightmare sequence which begs for a definite sequel.\nThe only bad side of this perfect movie was the overuse of Amazonian bgm which kinda ruined when it was used in the end And I knoe show mo shot is a characteristic feature of Synder but it was not necessary at some certain point.\nOtherwise this movie made us realise how Dc movies should be made. Hopefully higher authority might open their eyes and see the truth.", "La entrega de un director a su visi\u00f3n y a su fandom": "La mejor pel\u00edcula de superh\u00e9roes que he visto!!La puesta en escena de un c\u00f3mic de DC, de su mitolog\u00eda y de sus h\u00e9roes en su m\u00e1ximo esplendor.Zack sabe como hacerlo y es fiel a sus fans y a su estilo.Tantos sentimientos, tengo ganas de m\u00e1s pel\u00edculas de este universo.", "Have to watch it": "It's a really good movie, we need more and I don't how the same director did Batman vs Superman so bad, but this movie is his masterpiece.", "Fire Warner Bros Put Zack in Charge": "That was stupendously awesome!! There's nothing I could say that has been said. BUT I will say Zack absolutely deserves sequels after what can only be described as a lot of emotion gone into ZSJL and it shows, especially at the end with the simple words 'For Autumn'. As long as Warner Bro execs are not in charge, I think everyone believes Zacks vision should be realised.", "Far more SUPER than the 2017 version": "A much more fleshed out and constructed storyline helps Zack Snyder and his cut of Justice League wipe your memory of the rushed mess of a film that was given to audiences in 2017.\nThe characters are all given more screen time and more chance to shine apart from Batman who does seem a little redundant and not needed, however Ben Affleck does well with what he was given.\nWe can only hope that Warner Bros realise the potential thag a series of films could have under the guidance of Snyder and the cliffhanger the film ends on can have some.sort of conclusion, hopefully a little bit different to the thoughts Snyder has shared publicly.\nThis has given fans a reason to never watch the 2017 release of Justice League again and makes for a better DCEU", "Zack Snyder, You Beauty!": "I haven't written a review before this but the movie just compelled me to write one. To be honest I was not planning to watch this in one sitting but it takes a lot more than just a good movie to keep someone glued to the screen for 4 hours on a Thursday. Let me start by saying, and I am not exaggerating it by a tad bit, that this movie is everything the DCU was missing. Up until now, and I don't say this as a movie expert but just a movie lover, the DCU movies felt really rigid to the comic stories where they offered little to nothing when it came to the relatability factor of the characters. Wonder Woman and Aquaman came close to achieving it and were really good movies in a relative sense. But Snyder Cut just simply crashes through the glass ceiling, reinventing the DCU. The movie manages to do justice to the larger than life attributes of the superheroes and yet maintains the human connection with the audience through the snapshots of the origin stories of their characters. Every character gets their chance to shine, contribute to the greater cause and yet it turns out to be a balanced act at the end. Even villains have their fair share of screen-time to establish their presence and it feels almost overwhelming when the 'Defenders of the Earth' come face to face with them. Somehow the DCU, and really special credit to the creative genius Zack Snyder, have managed to click with the audience FINALLY and know exactly what they want and offer a tad bit more with every scene to keep us on the edge. Special mention to the grave digging scene where Ezra Miller says 'we can do this in a nanosecond' just shows the lengths to which the makers went to cater to even the speculative ones amongst us. And ohh how can I forget to mention all the easter eggs and potential timelines. So all in all, an amazing experience, worth the 4 hour runtime that offers a lot, not only in the present but also creates huge potential for future exploitation. I could only say one thing when the screen blacked out after the two so called post credit scenes - 'Zack Snyder, You Beauty!'", "A GOOD comeback of the Justice League": "The story itself was good in my opinion. It changed a bit compared to the 2017 version, but these changes were significant and much needed.The outcome of the movie was a relief compared to the previous version and it made me crave for more. I really wanted to continue to watch and see what would Darkseid plan against earth.Snyder's approach regarding the overall mood was really good. If you compare some of the previous shots with the new versions, you can really feel the difference. I love how he got rid of the unnecessary corny jokes and went for a more melancholic atmosphere.I won't lie, the music the cinematography and the cgi were almost perfect. Personally I would have loved if there were less cgi and more real shots. For example the batman fight scenes. It was a bit funky in some places where parkoured all over the place and kicked those aliens around.The characters were still a bit empty for me. Victor literally STOLE THE MOVIE. He's backstory and character development had been perfect. But I missed the development of all the other characters. I mean I really appreciate the scene when Wonder Woman showed her humanity with the little girl. But still a bit empty for me.On the other hand I was satisfied with the acting. Nothing remarkable compared to other classics but still, a great portrayal of the classic characters we all love.", "This is the Justice League we deserve!": "DC is number one in our house and we always watch the DC films, hopeful that they give life to our favorite characters in a way that does them justice. After the theatrical debacle that was Justice League (2017), this had to be better. So, we sat down to watch the 4 hours, hopeful.Well, it was everything we wanted and more. It played like a graphic novel. It gave true life to these characters. It set things up the way they should have been set up originally.Bring back the Snyderverse!", "I loved!": "The Snyder Cut is the most superhero film! Is perfect!"}
