            "content": "Ever wonder where Col. Kurtz would've ended up had he survived the end of \"Apocalypse Now\"? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals - the horror, the horror.This 1996 version of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" was such a troubled production that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like the 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau.\" Stanley championed the project, wrote the screenplay and was set to direct, but was fired after a few days of filming due to conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set.Actually that wasn't the main reason Stanley was fired. He was fine for small indie productions, but he was out of his league with a blockbuster like this. Veteran filmmaker John Frankenheimer was brought in to save the production from being a complete disaster. He got the job done, but his tyrannical approach didn't help matters.The production was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the set, but was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this Brando's well-known eccentricities, not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne, and constant rewrites and you have a formula for a cinematic chaos!In light of the horrible production and the ensuing bad press you would think this would be a lousy movie, but it's actually not THAT bad. I can see why some people don't like it because parts of the third act are pretty crazy and don't flow very well, but if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the mood & insanity of films like \"Apocalypse Now\" and the original \"Planet of the Apes\" (\"It's a madhouse, a MADHOUSE!\") you'll probably appreciate some of it. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of either of those films, but comparisons are inevitable and there are entertaining bits.The main problem is that the story isn't that compelling; the flow of the movie is off, which is mostly apparent in the mounting craziness of the final third, which tempts the viewer to tune out.Thankfully, there are some positives. The title sequence is kinetic and dazzling; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal; the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); there's some creative pizazz, like Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint where he's as captivating as always, albeit a fat bastage; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's \"Mini-Me\" is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are flashes of nigh greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.Marlon's Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz, i.e. nutjob in the jungle, albeit twenty years later. For Brando fans it's enjoyable seeing him in his old age. This was one of his final films and it shows that he had his magnetic charm 'til the end.Furthermore, there are some interesting themes: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's abode are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal 'village' in the forest; the most human-like one, Aissa, he even refers to as his daughter. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? Moreover, while Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictators are rarely good. When Hyena-Swine usurps the crown he immediately becomes a malevolent dictator.The original version runs 96 minutes and the DC 99 minutes. The film was shot in Cairns, Queensland, Australia.GRADE: C+",

            "review_title": "Fascinating mess of a movie",
            "content": "David Thewlis, looking like he's wandered in from another film, is totally miscast in this much-troubled version of the HG Wells classic.\nAfter being rescued by toothy vet Val Kilmer and taken to the eponymous location, our Mancunian UN hero comes across cat girl Fairuza Balk and the balloon-like doc (Marlon Brando), all pasty-faced and with an Ealing comedy accent. Marlon hasn't just been doing beached whale impressions on this exotic isle. You see, mad old Moreau has been messing around with gene-splicing and has created a race of humanoid beasts - courtesy of effects whiz Stan Winston.\nHe controls them with electric shock implants and is so taken with his work, has little other defence when the beasts inevitably start running wild. In essence, it all goes a bit Jurassic Park. There are a few good points in this mish mash. A stunning opening titles scene - very necessary considering the lack of any adventure for the first 10 minutes; Thewlis' extraordinary presence; and an okay finale. In fact, any scenes without Brando and Kilmer are quite fascinating. This is partly down to the Richard Stanley screenplay which boasts some flashes of brilliance amid much re-worked studio editing and re-jigging. This is one of those films where the making of the movie is perhaps more intriguing than the final product. Stanley, the film's original director, was fired and banned from the set. He actually went back, dressed up as a dog man extra, and watched the rest of the production unfold. Had he been allowed to finish his directing chores and had final cut, the result would probably have been a thousand times better. However, John Frankenheimer does a fair job under the circumstances.",

            "content": "You will have to chalk me up as belonging to that camp of viewers who actually *wanted* to see a truly horrid film (as based on all the negative reviews) only to discover to our delight that there was a gem of a movie hiding there all along.For me, watching the film was a *great* escapist experience. I felt exactly what the character played by David Thewlis would have felt, had I been in a similar \"lost in the middle of the ocean, end up on a strange island\" sort of predicament. The movie did a superb job of instantly whisking me away to a strange and beautiful and ominous place - the Island of Dr. Moreau - and I found myself staying with the fantasy the whole way through.\nThe cinematography was just beautiful, and if you have ever been in or near the tropics, the filming and the movie setting did an awesome job of conveying that hot, thick, humid, teeming-with-life feel that can only be found in the tropics.I really enjoyed the eery background music, it really added to the overall creepiness of the whole weird \"mad-science-gone-amok\" theme of the story. Plus that scene where David Thewlis first encounters Faruiza Balk, and she starts to dance to that utterly hypnotic and awesome Balinese music, was just too spine-tingling for words. I only regret that I haven't been able to locate any soundtrack information yet on the movie, so I don't know who played that song, but the whole scene was absolutely and truly memorable. I'd watch it again just for that song and dance scene alone.I noticed that many people didn't like the acting or the characterizations. I, on the other hand, felt that the four main characters (Brando, Kilmer, Thewlis, and Balk) were flawless in their depiction of a familiar tale. Brando was admittedly \"weird\" - but hey, give the guy his due, he was SUPPOSED to be a weird, crazed scientist. What were you expecting, the Maytag Repairman? Kilmer was deliciously evil, can't say enough good about Val Kilmer, he's always been one of my very favorite actors, and he DID NOT disappoint in this film, either. Balk, as mentioned above, was just awesome (and I REALLY liked the scene where she and \"father\" Brando had their moment of emotional bonding). Thewlis was right spot-on with his interpretation of an innocent \"sane\" observer who barely made it off this mad-house of an island without totally losing his own sanity. I think I would have done exactly as he had done, in his circumstances. Well Acted! Bravo!One scene that didn't work for me was early on when the man-beasts were shown to be delivering a hideous-looking baby from a hideous-looking beast-woman. I don't know, but somehow I felt that it should have been Dr. Moreau and Montgomery (Brando and Kilmer) who should have been the doctors doing the delivery. Nevertheless, it was a truly creepy scene.Finally, I thought the movie was well-stocked with thought-provoking comments on the morality of scientific experimentation. The scene at the dinner table, where Brando expounds on his personal views, comes to mind, as does the final parting comments, voiced by Thewlis. I had to watch the movie several times just to hear those words. They will REALLY make you think. I truly believe this movie should be seen and actively discussed by students at high school or college level - not just in science prep classes, but philosophy and social science courses as well. I don't care what the naysayers have to say, this was by no means an empty or shallow movie.So, go take a trip to the Island of Dr. Moreau. You won't come back unchanged....",

But. really - we get a Brando performance that again displays his long-held dismissal of Hollywood-ism, we get Val Kilmer hamming it up joyously (even to the point of repeatedly doing Brando impressions), we get David Thewliss (a damn fine actor) actually playing the most important character with admirable commitment, we get cat-eyed Fairuza Balk (yum!), we get the great Ron Perlman, playing a beast yet again, pretty much stealing the movie, we get something that is Dr. Moreau's constant companion, becoming a pop-culture icon thanks to South Park - as Chef puts it \"what the hell are you supposed to be? You don't look like anything\". Outstanding photography, effective tropical suggestibility (you can almost feel the humidity), excellent animal make-up, some truly memorable scenes (the birthing scene, the Hyena-Moreau confrontation) and even a sense of philosophical examination. And though the story of this insane scientist attempting to humanize animals has been done several times, only this one goes to the extreme of showing us that he's even created a bunch of tiny rat people! What a loon. Too much enjoyment for a movie so slammed.",

            "content": "It's an excitingly produced remake of \u00a8Island of the lost souls\u00a8 with Marlon Brando heading a solid casting as a nutty doctor who develops a process of transforming animals into half-humans at an desolated tropical island . Through DNA experimentation Brando has upset the balance of nature. By turning animals into humans, he's turned heaven into hell . It starts when David Thewlis is rescued at sea by Val Kilmer and brought to a strange island where he's terrified to discover the terrible genetic experiments realized by Dr. Moreau , a former prize Nobel winner .Passable horror-fantasy chiller that is developed up and down with some lousy moments and in other side contains eerie and thrilling scenes. It results to be a strong rendition of H.G. Wells' novel about an isolated scientific who has spent several years creating half-animals turning beasts into half-human . Good secondary cast as Fauriza Balk , William Hootkins and Temuera Morrison . Ron Perlman's sturdy acting , displaying a magnificent portrayal of one of the beasts . Watchable by excellent makeup by the late Stan Winston . Colorful cinematography filmed in Queensland , Australia , by the classic cameraman William A. Fraker and atmospheric musical score by Gary Chang . The motion picture is middlingly directed by John Frankenheimer and the director's cut version runs several minutes more . The movie will appeal to Brando devotees and Val Kilmer fans who will want to check out their excessive performances . Other adaptation based on H.G. Wells' known novel are the following : The classic of 1933 titled \u00a8The island of lost souls\u00a8 by Erle C. Kenton with Charles Laughton , Kathleen Burke , Bela Lugosi and Richard Arlen ; and 1977 retelling by Don Taylor with Burt Lancaster , Michael York , Barbara Carrera and Nigel Davenport .",

            "content": "This movie gets a bad rap -- viewers say Brando plain sucks and that it butchers a good Wells story. Perhaps the latter is true, but I consider Brando, as the mad doctor, a fine choice and, while he is rather subdued, he is still the candid, self-conscious actor we all know and love. He practically mumbles his lines as his mouth is lined with cotton and (probably) cheeseburgers. And, the scene where Brando plays piano along with his \"pre Mini-Me\" sidekick is a classic. Now, I know Brando refused to learn his lines for this movie and Kilmer is known for being a real ass to work with, but the in-production feuds add to the aura of this film. These characters aren't supposed to like each other and the tension fills the air. The special effects are top notch, albeit gruesome and a bit overdone. It all adds to the feel of the movie. I have this movie on tape and watch it again and again, alongside \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Rear Window\" and \"Dr. Strangelove.\" If you thought you shouldn't see this based on other user's comments, put your expectations aside and just enjoy!",

            "content": "Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result.For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis), adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreaus' second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk).This film is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law.One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham \"Grace\" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia.One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items \"Hardware\" and \"Dust Devil\") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer (\"The Manchurian Candidate\", \"Seven Days in May\"), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it.Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done.Six out of 10.",

I understand it was a troubled production and that may explain the uneven lurches in action.

Wells himself had an ambivalent attitude to the human race and was said to have had certain facist sympathies. However, Any philisophical points tended to be drowned by the rather garish direction. Brando's accent seemed wrong for the modern day setting of the film as well. A sad and distressing film that is well worth a look.",

Characters weren't historically well contextualized to make their activities coherent. Action wasn't founded but happened unexpectedly out of nowhere . It gave a chaotic sense to the film. Calling this film boring is totally off base. This is not a boring film. It just tried to encompass too many complex topics into a relatively brief film: animalistic brutality, confusion of origins, the frustration of many unanswerable questions to existence and suffering, the fragility of civil society and the often rigid adherence to laws to maintain a community. The film portrayed the dilemmas of human condition, suspended somewhere  between gods and animals. This film is definitely better than 90% of cheesy, brain dead, rubbish coming out of Holy wood.",

Uncontrolled version of H.G. Wells' horror story is crippled by behind-the-scenes strife and ego clashes. It opens well, sustains itself for about forty-five minutes, but then goes completely to hell afterward. John Frankenheimer is credited with the scrappy direction, though he stepped in mid-production and finished the picture after Kilmer had the original director canned. Too bad, with more focus this could've been incredible. Story previously filmed in 1933 (as \"Island of Lost Souls\") and with Michael York and Burt Lancaster in 1977. ** from ****",

You can thank Hollywood FX wizard Stan Winston for these creatures.Meanwhile, Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer \"play God\" attempting to create perfect human beings. What is created instead are \"people\" you almost don't want to look at. It took me two viewings to be okay with it. The first viewing left a bad taste in my mouth, but I gave it a second (and a third) look because the story is so different and intriguing. I liked Brando's dialog, too. His role, as \"Dr. Moreau,\" was easily the best in the film.What else is a bit unusual is that almost all the main characters in this are killed off by the end, some with sudden surprise.Back in the '90s, this was one of the best-looking DVDs I had seen up to that point.",

It's widely regarded as one of the worst films in history, and in many ways it is, if you consider the quality of the cast, director and budget.But revisiting it 20 years later after seeing the interesting documentary \"Lost Souls\" about this car crash of a movie, I didn't find it quite so bad. It's poor, no doubt about it, but it's not tedious and mind numbing in a Battlefield Earth kind of way and nowhere near real dross like Batman & Robin or The Spirit. It's entertaining for many reasons, chief among them being Marlon Brando's blatant trolling of the entire production, insisting on wearing white make up and using buckets instead of hats to keep his head cool. His performance is worth the admission alone.The rest is worth watching for the implosion of Val Kilmer's career as an A-List actor. Fresh from the success of films like The Doors, Batman Forever and Heat he was apparently extremely arrogant during the making of this film, and he just oozes apathy in every scene he's in. If he truly was as insufferable as he's been accused of in \"Lost Souls\" then karma certainly paid him a visit here, as his career never recovered from this wreck. Fairuza Balk is decent and tries her best with weak material, Ron Perlman is solid as always, but David Thewlis is miscast, his North England accent and bad teeth detracting from his performance. But those scenes with Brando and the worlds smallest man as his freaky sidekick are pure gold.The make up effects are decent, and the location is gorgeous. Everything else is terrible.

He was replaced by Val Kilmer, who had limited availability and unlimited anger issues after he too got divorce papers. Then Rob Morrow quit because the script kept changing. Brando left after his daughter committed suicide and upon his return, he would refuse to learn his lines and only listen to an earpiece.Oh yeah - Richard Stanley also had been fired days into production and replaced with John Frankeheimer, who saw this as anything but his dream project.I mean, what could go wrong at this point?After spending four years developing the films, Stanley had come to work with New Line, who responded by going behind his back to offer the film to Roman Polanski. Furious, Stanley got a meeting with Brando, who unexpectedly - or not, as Stanley had undergone a magick ritual to gain the actor's trust - proved very sympathetic to Stanley's vision. That said, Stanley was beyond familiar with the source work, as well as its connections with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which became Apocalypse Now, which still fascinated Brando. Even better, Stanley was directly related to African explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who had been the inspiration for Conrad's lead character - and Brando's role - Kurtz.That said, days into filming, Stanley was having difficulty with New Line executives and Kilmer, who was a legend of ego on this film. At one point, the former Batman burned a crew member in the face with a cigarette.Stanley was fired, but disappeared, finally showing up in dogman costume and acting in the very movie that he was to direct. Oh yeah - the full fury of nature would also destroy much of the set.This movie is an example of actors off the literal rails, with Brando's wearing an ice bucket on his head with the idea that he had mutated into a dolphin and the bucket was to cover up his blowhole. He also pushed for Nelson de la Rosa, the world's smallest man, to be his mutated twin. Brando was obviously in a much better movie than the one that we're watching.Meanwhile, the actors playing Doctor Moreau's children had a better time than anyone else, pretty much using the movie's long periods of downtime getting up to alcohol and drug-addled craziness. Again, they were in a much better film than ended up getting unspooled on the screen.Charitably, this movie is a mess. Would it have been better if Stanley stayed on board? Well, it certainly wouldn't have been boring.",

            "content": "I first became aware of this remake when a clip was broadcast on Barry Norman's FILM 96 . It's the scene where Dr Moreau ( Marlon Brando ) sits with his animal experiments and tries to justify himself to UN diplomat Edward Douglas played by David Thewlis . The reason the scene stuck in my mind was because Thewlis is best known for his work in British social realism movies so as Douglas points to the animals asking \" What the bloody hell's this all about ? What's he supposed to be ? \" I couldn't help thinking that Thewlis's performance had jumped out of a Mike Leigh movie . Even more bizarelly when Moreau replies \" You expect me to condense seventeen years into seventeen minutes ...\" Brando plays the part exactly - And I mean exactly - as he did as Col Kurzt in APOCALPSE NOW , and all the time the camera intercuts with Moreau's creatures all of whom are giving embarrassed looks . I thought because this clip was shown out of context that may be the reason it looked so ridiculous but unfortunately after seeing the whole movie I can say this is one of the least ridiculous parts of the movie THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU isn't as well known as some of HG Well's other books like THE TIME MACHINE or WAR OF THE WORLDS but it deserves to be remembered since it deals with humanism , genetic engineering and vivisection . Obviously these concepts were beyond the productions knowledge and we have a film that makes little sense . It goes without saying everything about the movie is bad , the directing is bad , the screenplay is bad and the acting is bad but the worse thing is the way the producers have tried to update the storyline by having much of the action take place in an acid house ! No seriously in order for it to appeal to a 20 something audience Val Kilmer's character ( Who's not really a character - He's just there to spout lines and be used as a plot device ) decides to have an acid house party with his furry friends . No doubt the animals favourite tune is Panic by The Smiths because they decide to hang the bloody DJ and install a new furrier music maker who then shoots anyone who either appears too sycophantic or too critical to his choice of music . The film ends with Douglas escaping after the animal experiments have killed one another in a shoot out Anyone reading this review without seeing the film will no doubt be phoning an ambulance for me . But the events take place on screen exactly as I described them and an ambulance would be better served by being sent to the house of the studio executive who was insane enough to finance this mess",

Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Species\" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island.The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of \"Naked\"), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of \"Tombstone\") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics.The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, \"Moreau\" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an \"E.T.\" infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's \"Northern Exposure.\" A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain.\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of \"Moreau\" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.",

            "content": "The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996)** (out of 4)Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) is found floating at sea in a raft and is saved when a boat being led by a man named Montgomery (Val Kilmer) comes to the rescue. The two men end up back on an island where all sorts of strange creatures are. These creatures, it turns out, are the work of Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando) who is trying to creature the perfect mix of human and animal.When I originally saw this film in 1996 I was shocked at how bad it was and I couldn't help but wonder how it turned out so bad. Then we got a brilliant documentary by David Gregory, which explains what happened during the production so I decided to re-visit the movie and I was surprised to see that time has actually been rather kind to the picture. There's no question that it's still a complete mess, which is no wonder considering what happened during the production but at the same time there's quite a bit of good things to be had here.For starters, the special effects are actually wonderful and this is especially true for the make-up effects. The animal people's make-up is terrific and you actually feel as if you're looking at a real mix between humans and animals. Of course, these effects are a major step up from the stuff we had seen in earlier version. Another major plus is that the story manages to do a good job in the creatures \"problems\" with who they are. There are many scenes where they want to know if they're human or some sort of animal and I found these scenes to be rather intelligent.The performances are also something that took a beating when the film was originally released but outside of Kilmer phoning in his performance, what we get here is actually pretty good. Thewlis makes for a good leading man and Fairuza Balk is good in her role of the panther woman. The various actors who appear as the creatures do a very good job at well and especially how hard it is to \"act\" with all that make-up on. Then, there's Marlon Brando. I hated his performance the first time I saw it but I must admit that it worked for me on this viewing. I thought he did a rather good job playing the \"father\" to these and I actually liked the way he tried to parent these creatures.Of course, that doesn't cover some of the really bad stuff here including the entire sequence with the ice bucket on his head. Other decisions the actor made like the white make-up was also incredibly silly and just doesn't fit in the film. Another problem with the movie is the entire relationship between Douglas and the panther woman just doesn't work. There's also obvious issues with the production that shines through including a rather action-packed and silly ending. I'd also argue that it just seems like the original film wanted to be something more intelligent but that was scraped.THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU still isn't a good movie but at the same time it's certainly not as bad as it was viewed in 1996. I'm one of the people who really crushed this film when it was released but this latest viewing had me seeing it a tad bit better. Still, you can't help but call this a disappointment since the materials were there for something much better.",

Yes there is an explanation as to why Marlon Brando as Dr. Moreau wears an ice bucket on his head in a bizarre scene.I didn't know anything about Richard Stanley, the original director who was sacked and replaced, until I read the information on IMDb trivia after watching the movie. Much of that information comes from the documentary.Like the 1977 version of the story, the film is based on H. G. Wells' novel where Dr. Moreau retreats to a remote island to put into practice his theory about creating humans from animals. The story is told from the point of view of a sailor who ends up on the island and witnesses the good doctor's work unravel as the creatures regress and tear up the joint.This version sticks closer in some ways to the basic structure of the book, but overlaid with the original director's vision of updating it to the present. The makeup and special effects are also many notches above the 1977 version.However it was the actors that sent the film off kilter, and that's where the fun really started. Few mainstream Hollywood movies ever went as completely out of control as this one. What becomes obvious in the documentary as you watch the interviews with the actors and crew is that they could dine out for years on the stories they have to tell - most of which revolve around Marlon Brando.Marco Hofschneider who played one of the creatures proves to be a brilliant raconteur as he describes interactions he had with the legendary actor. Fairuza Balk who was a supporter of the original director, and seemed traumatised by the experience tells of a conversation with Marlon where she actually does a brilliant impression of him. All were provided with pure gold for a lifetime of anecdotes, and reveal that what went on behind the camera was more entertaining than anything in front of it.The 1996 version is a mess and wears out its welcome before the end, but when you know why it ended up like that, it could be the most enjoyable movie you'll watch all year.",

This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material.The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).",

Val Kilmer is bizarre as his assistant Montgomery, playing it for camp, yet it is an amusing performance.

Fairuza Balk is the panther woman Aissa, and she is quite effective, as is Ron Perlman as the Sayer of the law.Film is faithful in spirit to Wells, if not in execution, and though it is far from a success, there is some guilty pleasure enjoyment out of it, and has some striking end narration in its memorable finale.The type of film that was more entertaining to watch than it was to make, if the first hand accounts from the cast and crew are to be believed!",

It looks like the inspiration wasn't Moreau, but rather Tod Browning's classic Freaks.The film was not done on the cheap either either, shot in gorgeous technicolor in a tropical location in Queensland in Australia, replacement director John Frankenheimer did the best he could, but he had a couple of runaway actors in Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer who just went completely over the top. And the computer graphic creations made me think that Narnia had gone over to the dark side.This was once again one of Marlon Brando's Christian Defense Fund films made to pay the lawyer's for his son's murder trial. It was during the filming of The Island of Dr. Moreau that daughter Cheyenne Brando committed suicide. I'm not sure what anyone could have done with Brando at that point.Of course I'm not sure what Val Kilmer's excuse, was except that he might have seen this was going to be an expensive turkey and he might as well cut himself a slice or two of ham. Brando's three hundred pound albino Moreau reminded me of Dale the Whale from the Monk series and he seemed to recycle bits of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now into his performance. Then Kilmer decides to do an imitation of him.When we first meet Brando he's being carried through the jungle on what looks like the Popemobile and dressed all in white and giving waves and benedictions to the crowd of his creations looked for all the world like the Pope going through St. Peter's. If this was to inspire awe, it missed the mark, I laughed myself silly. This version of The Island Of Dr. Moreau had to bow to advances in medical science since Charles Laughton and Arthur Hohl were operating in the House of Pain. What Brando is doing is injecting human DNA in various amounts in different creatures, creating his freak show. Still Laughton's sadistic experiments gave us more genuine terror than what Brando was doing.This one will make you nostalgic for the old House of Pain.",

Marlon Brando makes a daring, and critics said poor, choice in playing his Moreau like an effete, physically feeble, unbelievably polite British University English Professor, more eccentrically insane instead of the usual madly insane.

Indeed, the agent is told there is not one note of malice in them. However, it soon becomes obvious that Moreau's control over them is far from humane, and the good doctor is \u2013 not that there was ever much doubt \u2013 insane.Marlon Brando wrestles with an upper-crust British accent and some outsized false teeth. The accent is perfect, the prosthetics less so, rendering occasional moments of dialogue incomprehensible. His performance though, is terrific. Dangerous and a lot of fun. From his first appearance, draped in white, outsized sunglasses and a full face smothered in white 'sunblock', he is delightfully bizarre.The film loses something when Brando's presence is removed, and events become a bit of a jumble. Val Kilmer's Montgomery, who takes Moreau's place, is good, but he's no Marlon Brando.Ultimately, 'The Island of Doctor Moreau' is a thoroughly enjoyable film. David Thewlis (who joined the film after shooting had started, replacing another actor) initially seems miscast as Douglas, but he soon proves himself as the talented actor he is. The same can be said for the various hybrids, most of who really take advantage of the excellent make-up jobs and imbue them with tangible emotion which would be lost if everything was achieved with CGI.It is difficult to ignore the critical mauling the film received, due in part to a series of unfortunate occurrences behind the scenes.

            "content": "An unnecessary second remake (following the oft-forgotten '77 version with Michael York) of 1932's THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, based of course on the classic short story by H.G. Wells. A huge flop on release, this movie starts off pretty well and looks extremely promising with the crisp, highly colourful photography and interesting locations (Queensland actually). Sadly it deteriorates constantly as it goes on, until it becomes an almost parody of itself at the end, and is completely impossible to take seriously!Directorial disputes resulted in original director Richard Stanley being fired in place of the more mainstream John Frankenheimer, although even his veteran presence can't hide the dodgy editing and episodic nature of the narrative. The movie opens very promisingly with an well-choreographed fight aboard a rubber dinghy (trust me, it is very impressive) but that about as exciting as it gets. British star David Thewlis (not a bad actor, but his character is far too whiny to be likable) meets up with the ever-grouchy Val Kilmer, who takes him a remote island where they meet the incredible Marlon Brando. Brando overacts as never before in this movie, dressed in a white sheet and white face-paint, and his hamminess knows no bounds; his performance is so terribly and completely off beat that it serves as one of the movie's highlights.Soon afterwards, a hyena man discovers the implant which Moreau uses to control him through painful shocks, and tears it out, thus inciting a riot amongst the beast men, who eventually storm the island and learn how to use guns. The action-packed finale is absolutely terrible and laughable, with the beast men having far too much screen time (forget the eerie glimpses in the original - here they're on screen for ages which totally ruins their impact) and running and jumping about all over the place before they all kill each other.Aside from the miscast Thewlis, the wooden Kilmer and the laughable Brando, there is one other main character - Fairuza Balk (THE CRAFT), who plays a panther woman. Balk is far more attractive here than she was as the teenage witch in that other '96 horror movie, and indeed her feral beauty does most of the acting for her. Hidden inside costumes and make-up are a number of noted actors like Ron Perlman, Mark Dacascos, and Verne Troyer, but you'd never recognise them. The special effects are by Stan Winston, and the beast men are initially very impressive, with CGI being interspersed flawlessly with live-action footage. Sadly their overexposure soon shows and, as you see more and more of them, the less impressive they become until the laughing stocks of the finale.The morals are muddled and the film ends in an inconclusive fashion with most of the cast dead and the rest carrying on with their lives. A tragedy it is not as most of the dead characters are selfish and unlikeable or just plain odd. In the other versions, Moreau was attacked and killed at the end of the film, but that happens halfway through here, leaving the movie floundering with nowhere to really go afterwards. Kilmer ends up going mad too and dressing as Brando, but the irritatingly non-conclusive script means that you never figure out why.With an above average cast wasted along with a substantial budget, hopefully the poor reception of this movie at the box office has put off any other chancers with an idea of making a buck from a remake of a classic horror film. In an ideal world it certainly would, but I'm not so sure. THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is worth a look as a curiosity piece for sure, but it feels all the more frustrating as you get the impression that a good idea is in here somewhere, waiting to get out.",

Most people see a few giant performances followed by a period of excess and laziness, the only arguments being in when the shift occurred. But I see a genius who long ago exhausted the opportunities available in ordinary film opportunities, and who has gone on to invent others of his own devising.As far back as `One Eyed Jacks,' he started to work with metafilms: films whose goal was to work not in the story within the film, but the story of the film, and all that surrounds it. For example, `The Freshman' wasn't concerned with exploring any character or situation in the story it presented. That story was the merest of excuses to allow him to have his own metadialog with the audience. That dialog was fully supported by the writer and director of the film. But here and in `the Score' he strikes out without their support or even knowledge.Sure, the film itself is a disaster - who cares?

Chock full of messages, metaphors and allegory on man's ignorance and arrogance, this film is very much worthwhile seeing.

It will make many feel uncomfortable but give it a chance. This is not a snack, it's a serious meal and you have to be in the mood for that. Enjoy.",

            "content": "What exactly did I just watched here?To be honest, the movie started of promising. It seemed to have some nice actors and character and above all the movie made SENSE. However the movie started to go down hill rapidly and I mean really down hill!This movie is real wasted potential. The premise is good and interesting and good enough to raise some provoking issues. The actors are also good and so is the visual look of the whole movie (with the exception of its early special effects), with its Stan Winston make-up effects, settings and cinematography. Yet somehow they messed everything up and all of its potential is wasted in this messy, confusing, weird cinematic piece of garbage.It sounds ironic but from the moment when Marlon Brando's character appears in the movie, the movie becomes all quirky, weird and extremely messy. The movie starts to become very unbelievable and toward the end also very far from understandable. Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer are of course great actors but in this movie also unintentional funny and not credible as persons who like to play God. The act like a bunch of idiots in this movie and they do some weird things, Marlon Brando especially, who also looks totally ridicules with weird make-up and odd clothes. In one sequence he even wears an ice bucket on his head! Ice bucket helmet...I rest my case. I think that says enough about how this movie is like. The ice bucket sequences is iconic for the rest of the movie. He is also accompanied by a small dwarf like creature, who wears the same clothes and sits by his right side. It obviously formed the basis and inspiration for the character of Mini-Me in the Austin Power movies. It makes these sequences even more unintentional hilarious to watch.But yet it are still the well known actors who give the movie still some 'watchability level'. David Thewlis was perhaps not the right choice for the main character, he isn't charismatic enough for that but nevertheless he's a great actor of course. Marlon Brando doesn't plays such a prominent role as you would expect. He actually appears quite (too) late into the story. Val Kilmer perhaps delivers the best performance of the movie, until the moment when his character goes crazy. The movie further more features well known actors such as Ron Perlman, Temuera Morrison and William Hootkins in unrecognizable roles.I wish that the movie made more sense. It would at least had made the movie more entertaining to watch. It instead now offers very little entertainment, even to the most objective and open viewers. The way the story is told makes it far from interesting, compelling or thought provoking. If I had to tell what the story is about, I would say; about a bunch of weird like half human-animals who want to break free from their master and 'God', played by Marlon Brando. Everything else gets muddled into the messy story. It makes the movie look like a ridicules potential-less Z-movie from the '50's.Really not worth seeing. I only have one more thing to say, that should sum it all up; Ice bucket!3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I don't think there's a film out there with a more volcanically troubled production history than John Frankenheimer's The Island Of Dr. Moreau. It wasn't even supposed to be helmed by him, rather an upstart named Richard Stanley, who's control on the creative reigns was violently yanked away by the studio and given to notoriously fiery Frankenheimer, who, lets face it, could never really get his genetically altered ducks in a line when he took over. Between Val Kilmer acting like a lunatic and very nearly being replaced, Marlon Brando being an even bigger lunatic because he knew no one would ever replace him (the big guy had an ego to match his girth) and raging budget problems as a result of the antics, the making of this film was, in short, a straight up disaster. So now I've said my piece on the most talked about aspect of this film, I want to shift gears into an area that just doesn't get covered a lot in discussion: the final film itself. Because of the maelstrom of bad PR circling the film like the storm that maroons our heroes on Moreau's isle, many people just assume it's a bad movie, which is not the case. I happen to love it, and if anything the level of obvious behind the scene chaos seeping through just gives it an organic unpredictability free from shackles of a script that I imagine was fairly generic in the conception phase. This is a bonkers film, no denial from me there, but I'll be damned if I didn't love every certifiable, furry prosthetic adorned, opulent, disorganized minute of it. David Thewlis took over from Kilmer as the lead, when Val had behavioural issues, but they're both present and accounted for as the wreckage of a ship meets Moreau's isle, a twisted Eden where human animal hybrids live under the delirious monarchy of the good Doctor, played with reliably laconic mania by Brando. He's been playing god, the old codger, and his island is now home to a host of varied zoological wonders, and no narrative would be complete without it all going tits up in a giant mutiny later on. The practical effects are delightfully excessive and elaborate, packed onto specifically chosen actors who already have an ethereal, animalistic aura on their own. Ron Perlman is the sagely Sayer Of The Law, Marc Dacoscas the leopardly Lo Mai, Temuerra Morrison the lion like Azazello and wild eyed Fairuza Balk is feline goddess Aissa, who happens to be Moreau's daughter. 'She's a pussy' Kilmer quips in one of many candid slips of the tongue on his part. The inmates eventually run the asylum, or whichever clever parable you want to apply, and it hurtles towards a third act full of flying fur and fangs that releases the floodgates on Frankenheimer's lack of cohesion, the mad scientist workshop of Stan Winston's special effects, Brando's bug eyed dementia and Kilmer's ADHD riddled performance, in one scene going so off far off the rails that Thewlis has to literally break character and tell him to 'quit f%#kin around', an unintentional laugh riot. Brando has a midget Mini Me, too, which is never fully explained but always good for a nervous laugh, as the thing looks like a fetus that vaulted out of the womb a few month too early, although I suppose that's the point. Look, it's a mess, but it's a beautiful one, a kaleidoscopic parade of grotesque costumes and cartoonish performances wrapped up in a story so overblown and off the map it almost takes on a pulse of it's own. For insight on what went down behind the scenes you can read Ron Perlman's autobiography, watch the recent documentary on the film or simply check out IMDb trivia, but whatever went down for real, it ended up branding one of the most bizarre and wonderful creature features of the 90's, and I love every feral, freaky minute of it.",

G. Well's book was written in 1899 or around there. Jurassic Park was written in the late 1900s.2) This movie I thought was a lot more doable. You can't take any mosquito and magically find just Dino DNA in it. It just doesn't happen. You can mix human and normal animal DNA more easily because of the fact they are both alive today.3) Yes, this movie was a whole hell of a lot more depressing. JP ended with a kind of sad but relatively happen ending. Now, face it, a lot of things in this world do not end happily ever after. The world is not a fairy tale. Things don't always end happy.4) The character's were majorly changed between the book and the movie of JP. The JP Owner was more of an a**hole in the book and gets killed. Certain other didn't die as they did in the book. The Island of Dr. Moreau had a mad scientist who was portrayed well, and had a Montgomery who you could tell was mad five minutes into the movie. Then there was Edward Douglas who played a role of being amazed by what the scientist was doing. To tell you the truth, his attitude wasn't out of line. If you telling certain people you are their father, why would you hurt your own children horribly more than they deserved. Montgomery and Dr. Moreau did not get along but ate together, which means they hid their differences when in a group of other people. Which is more of a professional way to handle a situation. Fairuza Balk played a very sweet person, Aissa, whom did not like the changes she was going through. I believe everybody did an excellent job in acting. I do agree with most of the comments that say that the killing of the father may have been a little too graphic. If I was in this movie I would have liked to played Val Kilmer's role. His role was hella funny. Both movies had the same motto. \"Life finds a way. You can't control everything.\"5) Everything in JP was theory. Things in The Island of Dr. Moreau could probably actually happen. They will probably never ever have a Dinosaur Park in this world at any time in the future.

Val Kilmer (in the middle of his divorce) looked like he wanted to kill everyone there and then himself, and Brando was the beyond creepy crazy weirdo that they wanted to be 1000 miles away from. It was so bizarre... the tone of the movie from the actors *in* it was just as unsettling as the story. I don't get why they couldn't just fire Kilmer if he was causing most of the trouble, but it seems like the studio made him stay or made the team \"work it out\" or both.I graduated from film school years ago and this nightmare of a production is one example why I'm not pursuing that career any longer.

It's a jumbled mess of a thing, based on the H.G. Wells novel (which I have not read), but astoundingly lacking in the intellect department. White-faced, mountainous 'Godfather of Manimals' Marlon Brando conducts DNA experiments on a remote island, crossing men with cheetah, buffalo, etc. in an attempt to craft a perfect race; Val Kilmer is his constantly overacting assistant; and David Thewlis is the Daft Git who washes ashore and acts completely irrational every step of the way. While trying VERY hard to make profound statements on man, mutation, the manipulation of nature, all we have conveying these themes are gibberish on some 'Law' and Brando being referred to as 'Father.' While the creature effects by Stan Winston are well-done, the movie is so amazingly inept (comeplete with a \"Cannibal Holocaust\"-style ending pondering man's savagery) that it doesn't even resonate in a 'so-bad-it's-good' setting... Locate the infinitely superior \"Island of Lost Souls\" (1933) for a better telling of this material.",

Great special effects for the time perhaps but a paper thin story that failed to explore its subject and the implications thereof. This movie makes no such mistake. It explores themes of what it means to be human, whether ends justify means, and what is moral or immoral from different perspectives. It even explores the nature of good and evil to some degree. There are far too few movies, especially these days, that have this kind of depth and leave you, ultimately, to be the judge. Yes, it is disturbing; its meant to be. Yes, it is dark; its meant to be.

Aside from revealing secrets way too quickly and not exactly being original, it was a pretty decent film. But then, to quote Marlon Brando, \"...the horror\". What went wrong? I have no idea. All I know is that it looked as if the famed director, John Frankenheimer, must have given up and let his cat direct the film. And, as for the writing, it must have been left up to his dog...because this film truly is a dog! What surprised me is that although his appearance was weird and ghastly, Marlon Brando wasn't bad. Later in life, he seemed to often 'phone in' his performances--and he strayed very, very far from the scripts (which he was famous for not learning or memorizing). Here he might have done the same, but it worked. Val Kilmer, on the other hand, made absolutely no sense and looked as if he was on acid for most of the latter portion of the film. He must have felt pretty embarrassed by all this...or just didn't care (which it really appears to be). I could say more, but Mr. Kilmer is still alive and I'd hate to make him cry. But the biggest surprise I talked about above--Frankenheimer. How could the genius who directed classics like \"Day of the Jackel\" and \"Seconds\" make this mess?! Too often instead of brilliance, he gave us explosions, gun fights and bloody guts. What happened?! Why the appeal to stupid people and the sense of nihilism?!By the way, what did I think was the best moment in the film? Well, actually, there were two. First, when Kilmer's character was killed. Second, when the closing credits began to roll. Yes, the final half of the film is THAT bad! It's especially bad because it took a heck of a lot of money and the film STILL turned out this awful.",

Oh, the horror...the horror wasn't here though. It's simply a dull project that has nothing to say and show.Basically, what comes after the arriving of this strange man is a rebellion from part of the creatures that seem to have more power than their \"father\" and this desire of being human, just like us. It's not given much of a reason of why they want that, why this is so important to them. It's very vague! I believe that films that involve science and questions about ethics, humanity and scientific progress versus religion, those films must, at all times, have something great to say, a plausible way to make viewers think \"What if such thing happens? How we would react?\". Those insights are important but they weren't given here. I don't believe H.G. Wells would write a novel just to show an adventure, he must have made more than that, the film failed to capture this. It was nightmare to make this film (just check info at trivia) and it is a nightmare to watch it as well. If the creatures made by Stan Winston are the most enjoyable thing here, the rest is completely absurd by starting with the awful script (if there was one while making this thing), and ending with the waste of good actors like Brando, Val Kilmer (why he had to impersonate Brando as the doctor?) and Thewlis, reduced to playing scary expressions for the whole mess. Fairuza Balk deserves some credit for playing Moreau's creature/daughter, she was good and the actors who play the creatures as well. One of those flicks you can't wait for the ending to come right away once you started. I watched it and didn't like. If I were you I would skip this with no regrets.

The fact that original director Richard Stanley was fired only days into the shoot, and that a pouting Val Kilmer was allowed to run loose pretty much self-destructed this film. It's obvious that the heavily altered script was either slapped together, written on the fly, or at the very least not well thought out. The tone of the picture changes dramatically as it progresses (especially after its relatively assured beginning) but its not until we see Val Kilmer doing a Brando impression (certainly one of the most inexplicable scenes I've ever come across) that we realize no one seems to be in control of this incoherent mess. If this was just a schlocky b-movie there wouldn't be much to consider, but given the excellent cast, a capable director, and good makeup work, the occasional bits and pieces that register with the audience just make the film see that much more disjointed. For a big-budget action picture, \"Island of Dr. Moreau\" is a unique experience. It isn't as much bad as a mess, a cacophony of sights and sounds lacking a coherent narrative, and occupied by two egotistical stars too caught up making their own movie in their minds to bother with what's in the abysmal script.

Hollywood giant Marlon Brando plays the strange Doctor Moreau, who on a remote South Pacific island experiments with humans and animals. Of course the results end in a clan of \"special\" children for the egomaniacal doctor to defend along with his own quirky life style.\nBeautiful scenery and haunting background music; but the total weirdness of the story and sluggish dialogue does not a classic make. Brando does nothing more than is expected of him. And in this juncture of his career...all that is required for him is to show up, I guess. Forget about the great actor he was. Val Kilmer does the best he can with what he gets to work with. Sometimes smug; sometimes flat and boring. Also featured are Fairuza Balk, David Thewlis and Ron Perlman.This is really an experiment in viewing. So beautiful and fantastic a vista; but then so crude and ugly the experience becomes.

On so many levels, it's an unmitigated disaster. The problems on the set with the cast and crew are legendary. People getting fired, others getting mad and walking off, and some distracted by personal issues \u0096 it must have been like living a soap opera. Maybe it's all these competing issues that helps to make what should be an unwatchable mess so interesting. For all its faults, The Island of Dr. Moreau is actually quite an enjoyable experience.Bizarre would be a good word to describe much of The Island of Dr. Moreau \u0096 and I'm not just talking about the events in the movie's plot. The characters are just plain weird. Each appears to be competing with the other to be the most bizarre. David Thewlis' Edward Douglas goes through range of emotions including fear, lust, anger, and disinterest. If it weren't for Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer's Montgomery would be one of the strangest characters in movie history. He's like some sort of butch game-keeper with a death wish. But Brando is in the movie and his Dr. Moreau tops everyone. The scene with Brando in a muumuu and an ice bucket hat is a sight that must be seen to be believed. Words cannot do it justice. Add to that the variety of half-man, half-animal creatures on the island and you've got one strange collection of characters.Speaking of the creatures, the make-up effects are the film's strongest assets. Some, like Hyena or the Sayer of the Law, are as good examples of creature make-up as you'll see. These effects do add a certain creepiness to the whole thing (that is if you can keep from laughing at Brando's latest get-up).Despite enjoying much of the movie, I cannot call The Island of Dr. Moreau a particularly \"good\" movie \u0096 not in the traditional sense anyway. The movie has too many problems to do that. The movie is terribly paced, any attempts at drama or horror are usurped by the ridiculousness of the characters, some of the special effects look like they came from a Nintendo 64, and, frustratingly, none of the characters demonstrate anything remotely resembling common sense. As much as I hate to do it, but because of my mixed feelings, I feel forced to give The Island of Dr. Moreau a very wishy-washy 5/10.",

Gonzo is the word for John Frankenheimer's adaption of the HG Wells classic.

Why would the Island of Dr. Monsanto be confined to just this small island when Dr. Monsanto is already doing a great job in U.S. Canada and the world on a much larger scales.

It was actually cult filmmaker:Richard Stanley (Dust Devil, Hardware), who got fired during a few days of shooting.

I've seen a lot worse like 'Jack Frost' (not the Michael Keaton version but the film about a killer's spirit trapped in a snowman and goes on a killing spree! I found that film so stupid, I turned it off after 20 minutes!) But then again, I saw the unrated directors cut and saw probably more gore and blood than the PG original version gives out. Okay, here's the story. The year is 2010. Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) is lost at sea being the soul survivor of a plane crash (there were two other survivors but you'll have to find out about them yourself!). He is rescued by Montgomery (Val Kilmer) and taken to an 'island paradise' operated by Dr Moreau (Marlon Brando). It is while Edward is on the island waiting for the communications system to be fixed (so he can call for help) that he finds out what the doctor's secret project is. This mainly all happens in the first 20 minutes but I wont tell you the rest!Okay, first of all, I can see why this film has been beaten and bruised by so many people (especially the critics). There are several flaws in each film. In between conversations there are several pauses and although this is meant to put in suspense, it just makes the film drag. Also, the truth over the doctor's project is revealed in the first 30 minutes so it seems that the next 1 hour 10 minutes are a bit of a drag. Oh and Marlon Brando in that gear\u0085. Sorry it doesn't work!!!!!. On an off note, I've got a feeling that the doctor and his little friend were the inspiration for the 'South Park' characters Doctor Maphesto and his little monkey friend. I could be wrong though!However, this film is NOT (repeat NOT) unwatchable. It's quite interesting. Although Marlon is the star billing (well not on IMDb.com but definitely on the DVD cover and film credits), David and Val stole the show hands down (Hey I found a Val film I like! Cool! I'm not counting 'Willow!' in that because that rocks anyway!) Seeing him play the insane role was cool and I have to admit he was sexy!As for David, his acting was amazing (as usual) I cant think of any other word to describe it! I cant work out his accent but from watching 'Naked', his accent in 'Dr Moreau' is Mancunian but its stiffer than that in 'Naked', like he was trying to be posh or he was bored or just had a stick up his bum! This is one of the great moral stories of all time. The original story must have got its idea of 'Playing God' from Mary Shelley's book 'Frankenstein. We have the doctor trying to play God and create the perfect species by injecting splicing animals with 'perfect' human genes. Similarily Frankenstein decides to create the perfect men with a high intelligence and beauty! However, in 'Dr Moreau', there is the modern fable that sometimes, from the way we act, we are not always men but resemble the beast. This is portrayed highly at the end of the film with the final narrative.Also, the title sequence is terrific!Overall, I give it a 7/10- good but could be better!H xxxxxx",

Suspense, tragedy and even humor all make it into this H.G.

It plays like a good X-Files episode, with David Thewlis as our haggard Agent Mulder, playing a U.N. worker stranded on the island of classic Frankenheimer wide-lens shots. Val Kilmer tunes down his annoying level for most of the film as Moreau's right-hand man gone awry.

The action scenes at the end comes close to cliches but are plausible within the framework though and therefore spoils nothing.An example of a very unusual filming is that the main characters die without lingering close-ups, sobbing and famous last words. They die as they die because its on line with the situation and mind of the characters.The themes of gene manipulation, the persistence of instincts, morfologi, the flexibility of biology and human lack of broadsight (and insight) is handled with intelligence in a thought provoking manner - and that is rare in a movie.Dr. Moreau brilliantly portrayed by Marlon Brando may be mad in the eyes of everybody but he has a kind of broadsight (and insight) that is fascinating. If you have read and liked any books by the gene scientist Richard Dawkins (The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, The Extended Phenotype) who has theories on biology as profound as Darwins theories, this film is it!",

Suffice to say, had we gotten the original Richard Stanley film (the script is to be found online), we might have gotten a modern Science Fiction/Horror masterpiece along the lines of John Carpenter's The Thing. Instead we got one of the biggest film fiascos, perhaps, of all time. Marlon Brando looks (and acts) an utter fool as Moreau. So sad to see what was America's greatest actor as an overweight mime/clown, his glory days long gone. Val Kilmer is equally horrible in his role, on an incredible ego trip via the Batman film he was in, he gives a truly embarrassing performance that rightfully helped to derail his career. Fairuza Balk, at least, tries real hard. She was utterly disgusted at Stanley's firing and wanted desperately to quit the film. But contractually bound, she was forced to stay. She does well to hide the strain and give a good performance. But it's a shame she has to be associated with this. Other than that, it's the magnificent make up FX of the Stan Winston Studio that shines, and the beast men and women are very, very impressive.In the end, it gives misfire a new name and only further sullied the later, downward spiral, career of John Frankenheimer. Island of Lost Souls easily trumps this. Even the 1977 version is better. Honestly.",

            "content": "\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" made a mockery of the late Marlon Brando's talent & legacy. H. G. Well's incredible novel adapted to the Hollywood screen was better served in the 1977 version than this utterly ridiculous 1996 version. The story is based on an account by ship wreck survivor Edward Douglas(David Thewlis), English diplomat on a peace settlement. Montgomery, vet & Moreau confidant, finds Douglas adrift in the Red Sea adrift a bloody raft. Douglas arrives on Moreau's Island, where he soon learns what the good doctor is REALLY doing in his seclusion. Douglas is told that a radio is available to call for help & a ship will arrive shortly. Douglas meets the beautiful Aissa(Fairuza Balk), Moreau's daughter. Douglas is shown to his room by Montgomery where he is locked in for \"his own good.\" Having escaped, Douglas creeps up on a horrible operation & many caged animals. What Douglas discovers is the horror of science realized in half human/half animals created by Moreau. These poor creatures are subdued by shock implants & live by Moreau's pseudo-moralistic Laws for Men. The group of creatures are led by Sayer of the Law, a Ram headed blind man who preaches Moreau's rules of conduct to the masses. Dr. Moreau is creating monsters with science, being the same man who received the Nobel Peace Prize for inventing Velcro?!? Go figure!!!! As the doctor preaches the Law to the beasts on man's good behavior, a beast kills a rabbit & consumes it voraciously. Dr. Moreau finds out & holds a mock trial to flush out the culprit. Lo-Mai the Cheetah, guilty & frightened, lashes out at Moreau. Moreau shocks Lo-Mai into submission & forgives him. Lo-Mai takes a bullet to the head by Azazello & now the beasts realize that violence equals power. Hyena-Swine goes to the kiln where Lo-Mai is cremated & finds a shock implant on the cheetah's femur. Realizing what he found, Hyena-Swine pulls out his own shock implant & knows he can no longer be forced into submission by Moreau's shock control unit. With a few other aggressive animals with him, Hyena-Swine plots to kill Moreau & control the beasts on the island. All the while, Moreau continues his work despite the turmoil surrounding him.Douglas tells Moreau at dinner that his work is \"destruction & debasement\" of the worst kind. Moreau defends his work stating that \"I have seen the devil in my microscope & I have chained him. Metaphorically speaking, I have cut him to pieces. I am closer to perfecting the human species than you could possibly imagine, sir.\" Of course, Montgomery adds insult to injury by requesting rabbit fricasse instead of the usual vegetarion diet practiced on Moreau's island. During a routine med distribution, Montgomery realizes that Hyena-Swine is a loose cannon when the torn away shock implant is shown. Hyena-Swine runs & teaches his cohorts to rip out their shock implants. Planned & carefully executed, Hyena-Swine & friends invade Moreau's main house to let him know that the animals will be taking over. Dr. Moreau is attacked savagely & is murdered. Douglas threatens Montgomery to give him the serum to stop Aissa's regression to no avail. Montgomery is subsequently murdered by Azazello who was ordered by Hyena-Swine. War is declared, with Douglas (David Thewlis) & Aissa(Fairuza Balk) fighting for their lives. Aissa was Moreau's finest work but her \"cat animality\" was taking over. With no serum, Aissa's womanly appearance begins to take on a feline persuasion. Jealous of her favor with the Father, Aissa was murdered by her brother Azazello, leaving Douglas to fend for himself. Captured by Hyena-Swine's minions, Douglas is brought before the devious hyena to convince the animals of his superiority. Knowing of Hyena-Swine lust for power & yearning to be a god, Douglas tricks Hyena-Swine into the trap of his own lust for power & turns his brethren against him. The mad hyena is beaten by the others & throws himself into a fiery building. With a following day of raft building & supply gathering, Douglas prepares to leave Morea's island. Monkey man Assassimon begs Douglas to stay & Sayer of the Law refuses help to reverse the scientific damage caused by Moreau. According to Sayer of the Law,\"To go on two legs....is very hard. Four is better, anyway.\" Douglas finally left the island with a warning for all those who would follow in Moreau's footsteps. \"...and I go, in fear.\"Brando's Dr. Moreau was simply dreadful, as well as Val Kilmer's completely assonine performance as Montgomery, the beast people's jailer. Thewlis & Balk were surprisingly good in their performances with the rest of the cast floundering in the jungle abyss. Such a waste of acting talent & film!!!!!!Unless you just like to be insulted by horrible remakes & silly beast make-up work, grab your popcorn & soda. But remember, I warned you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "A misunderstood DNA tinkering scientist performs human-animal vivisections, but things go wrong when his creations begin to regress.The Island of Dr. Moreau is the third major film adaptation of H. G. Wells and plagued with production issues (later extensively covered in Lost Souls: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr Moreau) and unfairly (debatably) panned by critics. Director John Frankenheimer offers plenty of visual treats and along with the writers injects enough double crosses, surprise deaths and story twists to hold interest. The themes of nature, law, religion and society simmer behind the strained wacky nature of the characters. Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) survives a plane crash in the Java Sea and is eventually rescued by a passing boat which arrives on an Island, soon he finds that the inhabitants are human-animal hybrids. Writers Richard Stanley (the intended original director) and Ron Hutchinson offer a disciplined enough script. Referred to as \"The Father\" by the mutants, Marlon Brando gives an outlandish performance as the mad scientist. Val Kilmer, particularly makes the most of it as Montgomery - at one point mimicking Brando's Dr. Moreau with his best impression.Thewlis looks confused throughout, either due to the production or because of the character, either way his performance is fitting as perplexed Douglas, a U.N. agent who is in the middle of the warring mutant animals who are being controlled through fear using implants to exert pain. There's some entertaining moments between Brando and the world's smallest man, Nelson de la Rosa. Rosa's silent role as Majai, a miniature version of Moreau would inspire Austin Powers' Mini-me. Notable is Fairuza Balk as Aissa, Douglas' love interest. Sadly, Ron Perlman's extended cameo of sorts is wasted as the Sayer of the Law, a blind goat-like hybrid. The makeup and costumes are very good, but the CGI elements are '96 primitive and unnecessary as the cat-like creatures unconvincingly bound about. The action scenes, quieter tension filled moments are well executed and are at times menacing. The island's buildings, lush greens and sea blues of the on location shoot coupled with Gary Chang's music creates plenty of atmosphere, especially during the night-time scenes where the hybrid faction revolt, rampaging through the compounds huts shooting guns and blowing things up. Even though Richard Stanley never got to realise his darker version his DNA (no pun intended) is all over this. And while this film may have been made for the masses and less art house the late Frankenheimer's 1996 offering is arguably the most entertaining version of Wells' classic to date.",

I'm bringing this fact up because I think that this film --aside from the usual 'don't mess with God's creation' crap -- was trying to make a statement about international and domestic relations, about how the more governments try to interfere with international and domestic policies, the more they foul it up. Hewlitt's U.N. peace-keeping negotiator character reminded me of the U.N.'s inneffectual stance in Bosnia, something which I don't think was a mere coincidence. His character is laughably inneffective in dealing with the tensions at hand, just like the U.N. in real life.The mutated animals Moreau created have a suspiciously \"ethnic\" look to them...could it be that Frankenheimer was trying to make a statement about our governement's inneffectual domestic policies toward the underclass?

Beginning in 1913, it was called 'The Island of Terror' and created both heated controversy and moral outrage. Charles Laughton and Bela Lugosi's version was called 'The Island of Lost Souls.' Burt Lancaster and Michael York did theirs in 1977. In this modern adaptation of the same name, we have the late Marlon Brando as Dr. Moreau, Val Kilmer as his assistant, while David Thewlis is the Englishman stranded on that mysterious spit of land. There, he is welcomed as a guest, but unexpectedly discovers a brilliant, but unhinged scientist who has been tampering with hideous DNA experiments. As a result, the entire island is now teeming with animal mutations bent on killing him. Led by noted actors like Ron Perlman as the Sayer of the Law, the movie becomes a fright-fest in terror.

            "content": "I didn't know what to expect, as I sat down and started watching a VHS of this with some friends several minutes into the movie.At first I thought it was a movie about how a spoiled-rotten Englishman might learn a thing or two about life from a swarthy, island-hopping character played by Val Kilmer. The Englishman goes on about how cute a rabbit is, so Kilmer snaps its neck in his face, that sort of thing. That's right about where I started watching. For a few moments I thought Kilmer was going to preach about the desolation the seemingly innocent rabbit can bring to a beautiful island if its population goes unchecked, but then he broke its neck (and I never figured out why).Then I thought it was going to be a movie about teaching the spoiled Englishman how to loosen up and have a good time, when Kilmer allows him to discover the belly-dancing girl. A lot goes wrong; the Englishman exotifies the woman and alienates her at every step, and I kept thinking she was trying to seduce him to get close enough to smack him around or hurt him for being so inhuman in such a rottenly subtle way. Instead, she sees Kilmer watching from nearby and runs off. I thought Kilmer said something to the extent of bringing her some pudding upstairs, and my impression was that the Englishman was able to make himself comfortable with the thought of her as a toy, but still having no idea why he was on the island with Kilmer.Then the Englishman wakes up in some kind of jail, and running around discovers -- almost as if he was directed to -- a little zoo inside the mansion on the island. And then as he's walking around the little zoo, he discovers there are doctors taking a screaming, bloody, animatronic baby out of pregnant woman wearing a pigface out of Kubrick's \"The Shining\". Then he freaks out and runs around. The scene of him running or falling into a zoo happens again, later, and my impression was that the Englishman was receiving some sort of moral lesson for having not helped some small monkeys free another small monkey from a cage, on an island where obviously you're supposed to do something humane to balance out all of the things that make English people uncomfortable.Instead of learning to be less spoiled and learning to enjoy and share the company of the strange animal-people, the Englishman decides to always freak out and alienate and threaten everybody around him. When he gets his hands on a gun, it's really the pivotal point of the movie. At the perfect moment for the Englishman to say \"oh, I didn't know you were all buddy-buddies living under the careful watch of a fat man pretending to be the Empress of China,\" instead he waves the gun at all the animals and starts a power-imbalance that eventually unravels the island's entire social structure.Eventually there is a trial where a monster who particularly scared the Englshman is used as a scapegoat for the Englishman's crime of failing to help the boatload of little monkeys release their fellow little monkey from its cage. The Englishman's lawyer tries to defend him by stating that nobody is allowed to escape, but not until after he persecutes him by stating that nobody's supposed to act out violently. So, the scapegoat is given the opportunity to show how fierce of an animal he is towards the fat transvestite, who shoots him. The post-trial atmosphere is that the scapegoating has bought the alienating, rude, obnoxious Englishman some more time to live and think about what he's done, but that soon he's going to have to pay the price for his violence; that, or attempt to break the law of never escaping, and get killed in the process.Then something totally unexpected happens, one of the animal-people sniffs around the burned remains of the scapegoat and pulls a bone out and appears to be ready to eat a piece of charred flesh when instead he stabs his fingernails into his guts and pulls out some kind of little black box. Evidently this frees him from the island's mind-control network, and from then out the movie makes little sense.Despite not making sense, the movie has three great scenes later on: 1. the fat transvestite playing a baby-grand piano, with a small version of himself sitting on top of that piano and playing his own, smaller version of a grand piano. Then, there's a scene where the alienated girl pours stuff into an inverted bucket on the transvestite's head, and he scolds her for making it too strong. Then he convinces her that being like him isn't so great because his behaviour is so strange. The best scene in the whole movie is when Kilmer dresses up in enough clothing to cover his form and sits down dictating in the voice of Marlon Brando. He sounds just like Brando in \"Apocalypse Now\" when he was talking into his recorder in the jungle. Then he turns around and because his form is so hidden he looks like the little guy from the piano scene. So it came across like the little guy was pretending to be the transvestite in the transvestite's absence. It was so ridiculous that even the Englishman ran out of the scene screaming laughter.That's what the movie was about.",

Certain aspects of his performance makes me wonder if somehow his character from Apocalypse Now survived in the jungle, went further mad and ended up a mad scientist turning wild animals into phony human creatures was very impersonalities, ranging from gentle and sexual to majorly violent, with one basically a child like creature, and a few looking like what you might see at a San Francisco or Greenwich Village or West Hollywood Halloween festival. Val Kilmer, the doctor Who has washed ashore, is aghast by what he sees, starting with the person who rescues him and shows him a cage of rabbits, breaking one of their necks out of the blue for no apparent reason.The alluring Fairuza Balk is much more convincing in this film than Brando or Kilmer, playing her role completely straight as one of Brando's transformed creatures, one he refers to as his daughter. When you see the first of Brando's transformation experiments, it looks like something out of a 1950's Yeti movie, absolutely ridiculous in appearance, like something from a Saturday morning kiddie show. Brando obviously had no real interest in this movie, and he pales in comparison to Charles Laughton in the 1932 original and Burt Lancaster in the not so good 1977 remake. Even the two unofficial versions in 1958 and 1974 were better than this one that is just laughable from start to finish.I give it a higher rating simply because I viewed it as a comedy rather than the science fiction/horror original story. Kilmer doesn't so much give a bad performance rather than just walk through his part as if he couldn't wait for it to be done. The result is a lame brained farce that indicates that movie studios really need to stop doing remakes, and that certain actors need to really retire before ending their career on a travesty such as this.",

Something did go terribly wrong, and I don't mean the good doctor's experiments, either. What proceeds to spew forth from the film is a jumbled, loosely-knit, campy collection of scenes strung together. The only things this film has going for it, is the some good special effects. The music by Gary Chang is haunting and bizarre. The rest of the movie, you can pretty much skip. Of course, we know this isn't exactly John Frankenheimer's fault, as the first director left before the project was completed. Don't even bother to look for a hint of continuity, or you will go as mad as Brando's character is supposed to be. Speaking of the marvelous Marlon, where DID they dig his costume up? He was a wig short of impersonating Divine. I had to ponder what effect this portrayal would have on the sale of muumuu's.

Terrible performances by Brando and Kilmer matched by the hammy struting of Thewlis coupled with this garish script add up to a disappointment.  I have to look hard for any pluses and can only think of Balk's gorgeous, provocative Balinese dancing interrupted by Thewlis, and Brando's remark, upon hearing the monsters banging on the piano, that it sounds like Schoenberg.

This is the kind of sad thing Brando was doing towards the end of his career. This is well-mounted and the surgically offended \"animals\" truly and foolishly abused. Val Kilmer is very good in spite of having to perform the silly scene which ends in his death. Wells would, no doubt, find it amusing that after a life pretty much devoted to Fabian Socialist thought, he would be characterized as fascist. He did indeed think humans were, if not perfectible, they were at least improvable. I guess I should read the book and get his take on th Doctor's motivation.

David Thewlis is boarded onto a ship where Val Kilmer takes him to an island populated by creatures that are half man and half animal. A device is planted within their system that controls them. Concept still works with much suspense but the climax is an ongoing battle that never seems to end. Director John Frankenheimer succeeds in the film's mood but he is hardly matching his work in The Manchurian Candidate. Thewlis fares well amongst the cast as a drifter becoming a prisoner but upon learning the process involved he sets his sights on survival. Marlon Brando is an interesting case as Moreau but his concluding scene was perhaps a tad premature. Val Kilmer is confusing towards the conclusion and unreadable before that. He locks Thewlis in a room and becomes like a different person. Fairuza Balk plays an animalistic female who attempts to help Thewlis but unfortunately her role is nothing more than a romantic tease and a violent dismiss. Whether viewers will prefer this over spending all day watching Animal Planet is up to them. The theme still works regarding our animalistic behavior that traumatize our society. Score: 7 / 10",

Then in the middle of the pacific, David Thewlis lay in his raft, after he was involved in a plane crash on route to Jakarta. He is rescued and taken on board a vessel carrying none other than Val kilmer who plays Montgomery. he return with him to Moreau's island, where there are some brilliant camera angles. he is locked up in a bedroom and kept prisoner, until he escapes and views the delivery of a monsters baby, who also monsters are delivering. It becomes apparent of Moreau's experiments of cross genetic mutation and in follows a tribe of Moreau's unigue children all with features of another animal. the Hyena of the group's friend is killed by Moreau's son and is burn't. Hyena finds the remains of a chip which is used to shock the animals. He begins to form alliances with other fellow mutants and wage's a battle against the doctor. There are many explosions in this film along with good plot twists. the film ends with Thewlis leaving the ill-fated island in a raft/dinghy recounting his thoughts of his involvement on the island. Unfortunately, not all of Brandos talents are shown in this film due to his premature departure, leaving Thewlis and Fairuza balk to continue the film, while Kilmer goes insane and ends up being shot while impersonating the doctor in his white robes in the animals underlair. Thewlis is brilliant, kilmer provides some good momentum in the film and Brando and Balk go a treat. Another actor, Ron pearlman also desevres some recognition in this gripping film. Although the film is 92 minutes long which is short for the storyline, the film is still wonderful. If you do see the DVD, buy it. Although unlike Region 1 which has Interviews, trailers and an extended runtime by 8 minutes, Region 2 has no extra's to moan of, but on it's own the film is still marvellous.

There is a point in a film when you can literally look into someone's eyes to see if they are interested in this film, or just collecting a paycheck. Kilmer and Brando were collecting paychecks with this film. It says something about the film when the lead, David Thewlis, refused to see the final version because he knew that it would be bad. That is someone on the inside reviewing the film and pointing out the flaws, now we all know that can't be good.From the small person next to Brando to the unquarkiness of Kilmer's part, this film never went anywhere. I kept waiting for this pivotal moment where suddenly it would just click, but it never did. The monsters, if you dare call them that, were unfrightening and dull. They seemed to be a cross between Burton's Planet of the Apes and leftover garbage. Sadly, these horrible costumes overshadowed the possibility of some interesting symbolism. Oh wait, I think that was all Brando's fault. I realize that he was trying to play God and bring some religious moments into the film, but failed because Brando forgot to build his character. I don't mean to jump on the bandwagon here, but this was a horrible film. The story was cheap, the set was even cheaper, and the actors felt like a cheap leisure suit.

Based on the novel by H.G. Wells, The Island of Dr. Moreau is supposed to explain one of the key differences between man and beast, man has the ability to create law and order. That said, I personally think it's important to acknowledge that man is not separate from the animal kingdom. We too of course are animals. Sir. Darwin knew it a hundred and fifty years ago, and modern science knows it. Even the church knows but won't accept it. Such a theme has been touched before of course, and actually The Island of Dr. Moreau is the last film I'd recommend to get the message across. this b-grade sci-fi flick is occasionally interesting, and potentially freaky (in the sort of way that dark fairy tales are) but generally, its just reckless and dumbThe curtain rises with a sensational aerial shot of a life raft adrift on a soft blue sea. Three souls are on board, two kill each other in a fight and the third, Mr. Douglas (a UN representative) is left in nature's hands. He is picked up by a small ship and taken to a lush jungle island, where he finds out that the once famed Dr. Moreau has been hiding for seventeen years conducting bizarre experiments of a rather hairy nature. What could the old doctor possibly want with an ordinary guy like Douglas, and why is it becoming increasingly evident that the island ain't gonna let him go.The set-up is very good, but after about forty minutes, the scenario becomes kinda pointless, starting from when we meet the old Doctor. So this where Marlon Brando's career ended up in the last years of his life. The actor who delivered two or three of cinema's most memorable performances ends up dressed like Miriam Makeba, and doing a terribly inept David Attenbourough impersonation. I'm not even sure I'm that sympathetic personally. Val Kilmer and David Thewlis are equally lazy and sloppy in their performances. some of it also has to to with the atrocious dialog they have been given.I'll gives props to Stan Winston and his make-up department for the weird and wonderful beasts on this crazy island. If anything they are a step up from those goofy apes in Congo, (made the precious year). Here, there is a variety of forms and styles, almost as many as there were dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The creatures themselves are rather emotionally confused it seems, but they all share the wish to be human, like 'the father'. Well, the film favors them in one manner. They get to deliver dialogue as equally cheesy as that of the few humans on the island. It might have been nice if the story got us to care a little more for these guys. There may have been some thematic values there too, a chance to explain how one cannot be judged by its looks. Perhaps the film's intention is to do the opposite, and get us to see them as what they look like; savage beasts. It's really not something worth dwelling on.The Island of Dr. Moreau is a little over ninety minutes, which is about the average length for these sort of movies, but it feels surprisingly short. Among many other things, it is definitely in need of a couple more scenes which focus on character rather than chaos, or motif rather than monstrosity. I think I'm being somewhat generous to The Island of Dr. Moreau. Though not terrible, it is very silly indeed, and perhaps the money would've been better spend on making it a theme park ride after all.",

The makeup effects throughout the film are above-average, especially as it shows the animals progress, and while the CGI is spotty sometimes, the technology was only a few years old at that point, and its passably good enough. if this movie starts to fall apart a bit, its the sequences inside the villianeous tribe of animals, because here, its more about showing off the physical performances and some pyrotechnic explosions, and thus the whole thing has a different vibe and directorial style than the rest of the film. Its understandable, because these parts were probably filmed by a different person who specializes in these types of sequences. David Thewlis is great at being constantly and progressively fed up at the whole ordeal, and Val Kilmer brings a certain magneticsm as well. All in all, i'd recommend for a lazy Sunday viewing if you have nothing else going on., if for no other reason other than witnessing the Brando performance which has been references a lot in pop culture.",

            "content": "Using big name actors to sell a movie isn't a bad concept. However, using them just because it supposed to sell a bad movie is another thing. It's even worse though when it goes beyond even those intentions. For director Richard Stanley, he was at a point where he was making his way up, and was getting close to the place he wanted to be. His hopes were to create a film based on H.G. Wells Island of Dr. Moreau novel and make it into something that would be totally his, while giving the story a new twist. Unfortunately for him and everyone else on board the movie, nothing worked out the way it supposed to. Stanley was fired not long after filming began, mainly because of the lead stars Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer. However that was just one of the disruptive moments in the process.Amazingly, as bad as things were, the film crew managed to put together a film that isn't too discombobulated. Yet this doesn't mean it's a good movie either. Instead, much of the story comes off lazy, unfocused and board. With Stanley fired, John Frankenheimer was brought in to take over. This didn't help though. While partially working with Stanley's script, Ron Hutchinson (Blue Ice (1992)) was also brought in for rewrites. This furthered the confusion and it shows. While becoming stranded out in the ocean, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) is picked up by Montgomery (Val Kilmer) and brought to the island of Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando). What Douglas doesn't know is that Dr. Moreau has been doing twisted experiments, mixing human and animal genes to create new monstrosities.Premise wise, it sounds uniquely horrifying, but that's where it ends. The execution of the plot is very similar to that of something like Planet of the Apes (1968). Dr. Moreau is the one who keeps the order on the island and has a device that remotely controls his creations. Though hiding behind something to control everyone else can prove to be ill advised. What really doesn't help the plot is the whole purpose behind it. Dr. Moreau explains the testing that he's doing, but he doesn't go into detail on how it'll benefit anyone outside his reach. He was outcast to that island because his actions were so controversial. As for characters, there's really very little to get behind. David Thewlis as Edward Douglas is a sympathetic character but there's not a lot of focus on him. Instead much of the attention is given to Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer.Being that Dr. Moreau is played by Brando, it could be understood as to why he would have more screen time, but Kilmer's character is just bizarre. He explains how he got in contact with Dr. Moreau but that's it. The rest of Kilmer's performance is all over the place. It's difficult to tell whether he was acting or being lazy. Brando, although a credible actor, does seem disengaged at times. He does give a sense of mystery to the doctor, but it's only for a short while. This is the unfortunate bit, being that the marketing went on about having Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando being the faces of the movie, when there was more to it. Plus, David Thewlis' role had more significance. There are other actors viewers may recognize like Fairuza Balk, Temuera Morrison, Ron Perlman and Nelson de la Rosa.The real positive things that can be said for this creature feature were the visual aspects. The makeup effects crafted by master Stan Winston was spot on. Making the combination between human and land animal type features can be tricky, but Winston made it look easy. Sort of like a 180 degree turn from his work on Leviathan (1989), which involved human and marine life mixing. The cinematography shot by William A. Fraker was decent. With filming locations coming from Queensland Australia, the jungle terrain looks legitimate. Fraker also worked on 1941 (1979), Tombstone (1993) and Waking Up in Reno (2002). Lastly, the music composed by Gary Chang was an intriguing element. The tracks heard are reminiscent to that of his score from Sniper (1993), but thankfully, he gives this film its own theme. Not to mention, it got its own release which is rare for him.Sadly, the premise, makeup effects, cinematography and music cannot save the wildly unfocused performances by the cast. It may feature heavy hitter names, but they don't save the feature after all the trouble it went through. The plot execution isn't even that unique.",

            "content": "I followed the legendarily messed-up production history of ISLAND OF LOST SOULS from the time the stories first started hitting the press. Once the film came out and met with such a dire reception, I never did actually see it. But, it was on HBO this week, so I figured 20 years was a long enough wait. Dang! TWENTY YEARS! Yup, it's a mess. The bare bones outline of it isn't that unworkable as a relatively modern take on the HG Wells tale. Unfortunately, it seems that everyone in involved from the two Directors, the various screenwriters and all the main actors -- we all making different films! Directors Frankenheimer and the dispatched Stanley certainly didn't see eye to eye, and their scripts reflected that disconnect - when there was a script. Several of the actors report that scenes and bits were improvised along the way and lots of folks deviated even when there was a scripted scene.But, even if you ignore all that, the principal actors were all doing their own thing: Kilmer seemed to think he was in some bizarro 80s stoner flick. Brando was doing a nutso version of his Apocalypse Now Kurtz character -- if he was at all focused on doing any one thing in particular (the ice bucket on the head bit is a very amusing improv bit). Poor David Thewlis who was dragged over there as a replacement for Rob Morrow when he quit a couple of days into the shoot. Thewlis seemed to be trying his best to deliver an earnest performance against all odds. But, even he, seems to have lost it in his last scene with Kilmer, grinning deliriously (probably because he really wanted to pummel him). Fairuza Balk manages to be sympathetic somehow in all the mess. Never understood why she hasn't had a bigger career. She's been very good in everything I've seen her in. Fortunately for Ron Perlman and the rest of the manimals they get to hide behind their (very good) Stan Winston makeup.In the two decades that have passed a small cult has grown around the film making it out into some kind of so bad it's good masterpiece. While I did find amusement in some of the asides (like the Ice bucket and Kilmer's Brando impression), LOST SOULS is just a bad movie. After having seen it, I can understand why a fine actor like Thewlis has sworn that he will never even watch it.",

How the hell did this movie get finished and then released? It's incomprehensible; the plot makes no sense, the characters go back and forth with their logic and the direction is unsure if the movie wants to be a body-horror or comedy.And to top the absurdity of the movie off it's bookended by narration that tries to give meaning to the nonsensical experience we just witnessed. It tries hammering the relevance of men playing god by using newsreel footage at the end of the movie. The big problem though? Nothing happened in the movie to warrant using this commentary at all. It's just an overblown adaptation of a HG Wells story that could have been a good experience if the production wasn't such an outright disaster from start to finish.This movie is a classic 101 in what NOT to do in Hollywood moviemaking: and it's bound to be a token example for years to come.",

Even the normally reliable Val Kilmer is bad here, and that's saying something. So is the late Marlon Brando, though David Thewlis, Fairzu Balk and Ron Perlman aren't too bad. I can only imagine that the film suffered from off screen turmoils, such as the many changes in writing, directing, the now legendary off screen problems between Val Kilmer the late director John Frankenheimer; I can only assume that Kilmer's inner pain from his divorce must have gotten in the way.Point of interest: the film features three men who have been involved in comic book adaptations. Brando was Jor-El, biological father of Superman in the 1978 Superman film, Kilmer was the 5th actor to play Batman, and Perlman later played Hellboy.

The remainder of the performance is a passable imitation of Sidney Greenstreet in \"The Maltese Falcon\" having a chuckle at his own expense.

Like the proverbial train-wreck it is horrible to see but impossible to look away from. As for Kilmer and Thewlis, they were present.

Throughout the film Edward plays a voyeuristic role and like him we all become spectators and see all the spooky events that happen during the island, the FX's and makeup are great, a good mixture of suspense and horror/survival in this remake, the fact that Edward is the only character that stays alive in the end made me happy!Cons: Obviously a movie of this type will always leave a lot to be desired, it is somewhat uncomfortable that Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando are just the biggest names trying to sell this film believing that it will not be disgusting because their characters are very stereotyped!

            "content": "One needs to have a serious sense of humor to watch this epic disaster of a movie which I luckily have about this film.This reboot of H.G. Wells's classic mad scientist tale maintains its roots in the original material. The story is straightforward in staying relatively faithful to the novel on which it is based. As with every book to screen adaptation there is of course Hollywood changes such as adding in a love interest for the hero. Sadly that lowers the quality of the story a bit, but does not derail the plot.What does hurt the film is its horrendous miscasting of the lead roles. The story of switching cast members around on this project is highly infamous. In particular is the switch of star Val Kilmer from the film's hero to the film's secondary antagonist; this was at the actor's request due to his on- set rampage over personal issues that he took out on his fellow actors and the crew. Kilmer is not convincingly villainous as Montgomery, rather a crude caricature of a wannabe baddie. Taking Kilmer's spot as the hero, Douglas, is a terribly miscast David Thewlis after actor Rob Morrow bowed out due to the chaotic nightmare of the film's delaying production. Thewlis is visibly uncomfortable in the lead role that it shows during the entire film. And finally in a disastrous turn as the mad Dr. Moreau was the infamously uncooperative Marlon Brando (he won the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor over co-star Val Kilmer for the film). Brando clearly demonstrates his lack of preparation for the role as he recites dialogue just as someone reading it to him; one of Brando's infamous tactics in all his later work. Chemistry between all members of the cast is absent and is completely evident from the start.I do recommend seeing this film more for the notoriety of the production process. It's one bad \"B movie\" though like a \"D movie\"",

This is a man that has played motorcycle thugs, rapists, godfathers and military demagogues and yet he still had the creative range, to play this Kabuki makeup'd, mu-mu wearing mad scientist with an overbite and British accent as authentic as any dowager auntie on loan from a Merchant/Ivory film! The way his character goes on about the heat (hello , it's the tropics) is worth a belly laugh alone. It's so old school British. Watching him I couldn't help but think he was having a ball creating this highly camp but incredibly plausible character. I dare say he much preferred this vehicle to The Freshman...ad to all those naysayers out there i challenge you to play both movies back to back and see which one you favor as a testament to Brando's latter day roles.",

            "content": "About: Dr Moreau(Marlon Brando) is a geneticist who has been using science to turn animals into humans, in hope of creating the perfect life form. Edward Douglas(David Thewlis)is the only survivor of a fatal plane crash, he has no other choice but to stay on Dr Moreau's remote island in the South Pacific.  Hoping only to stay a little while, Douglas's stay turns into a nightmare when he finds the insane Moreau and the untrustworthy Montgomery(Val Kilmer) have been constructing brutal experiments that have turned creatures into human-like beasts that blindly treat Moreau as a god. When things go wrong and the beasts revolt, Douglas finds himself fighting for his life and the future of mankind!Now, for my opinion.:)  After reading H.G. Well's book, \"The Island of Dr Moreau\", I wanted to see how the movies treated the book in their adaptation of the cult classic story. I've found that this 1996 film brought the book to a modern day world, giving leave for Dr Moreau's technology to expand and venture even further into the unknown. I thought their own translation of Dr Moreau, Montgomery and Edward Douglas, were really quite believable.  The human beasts are pretty believable, but I felt as though they didn't quite have the eerie affect on me as the book had.  The music does help add depth the movie. The only thing that I was annoyed with when I first watched it, was I felt as though all the dialogue was rushed and the movie went to fast.  Second time I watched it, I was able to catch more and appreciate the plot without getting overwhelmed with everything else. Now as a warning on this film, Dr Moreau is obsessed with his work, becoming a god and having his 'children' obey him, this leads to him saying much about 'finding the devil in science', which he rather extensively explains in one scene to the troubled Douglas.  But I will say, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, and wouldn't mind watching it again.  I think one of my favorite scenes was when Edward comes across Aissa dancing.  The choreography and music in this scene are just stunning!",

However the transcendance of medium achieved here relies on David Thewlis and Val Kilmer as well. Each of main leads bring their own rich flavour of campiness. The happless Thewlis brings a turn of the century stilted formality to pay at least part homage to the original work, which is otherwise deservingly massacred. This arch patina of homoeroticism is in turn burnished up to a flashy sterile veneer by Val Kilmer's fleckless self prostitution. The dynamic between the two, compelling in itself, is both eclipsed and illuminated by the pure radiating light that is Brando. The three form a constellation of pulsing chaos that drives the film though its myriad of clich\u00e9s punctuated with whatever viceral imagery stayed off the cutting room floor.

Director John Frankenheimer turns Wells' story into a turkey.Marlon Brando plays Moreau as a Kabuki drag queen; even Charles Laughton, who played Moreau in the 1933 adaptation \"Island of Lost Souls,\" didn't go that far over the top, even though he hammed it up deliciously.  Otherwise a good cast utterly wasted:  Davis Thewlis, so sympathetic in \"Restoration,\" so nasty in \"Dragonheart,\" is pop-eyed and foolish as Douglas, our frightened protagonist.  Douglas is probably the most undiplomatic \"U.N. delegate\" in the history of that organization: after several of Moreau's \"children,\" feral-looking but tuxedoed, have politely introduced themselves, Douglas rudely scolds Moreau for having these \"monstrosities\" in his house! Val Kilmer as Montgomery, Moreau's assistant, is on hand for no other reasons than to dispense attitude and make himself inconvenient (just like real life).  And the very busy Ron Perlman is unrecognizable as a ram-horned Sayer of the Law.  Much as I like Mr. Perlman and the quirky movies in which he tends to appear, Bela Lugosi he ain't.  Of all the cast, only Fairuza Balk is well-used as the cat woman.  Ms. Balk, who was a lovely child when she appeared as Dorothy in 1985's horrifying \"Return to Oz,\" grew up to be a beauty, and the camera gives us numerous close-ups of her haunted green eyes and full red lips.  Even the sharpening of her teeth, as feline regression sets in, doesn't mar her beauty:  \"I'm hideous!\" she sobs, but it'd take a rudely-applied pan of battery acid to make the word \"hideous\" applicable to this face.  The many extras who play Moreau's other experiments are buried under latex false faces which, while ingenious, are nowhere near as effective (i.e., frightening) as the understated pointy-ears-'n'-teeth of the 1933 original. And the story quickly becomes muddled, episodic, and incoherent, losing all momentum and every trace of one-thing-leads-to-another as it stumbles on to its end.

However, as an allegory of the duplicitous nature of man and his role in the cosmic anarchy of post-modernism, it is one of the most brilliant, inquisitive, and socially relevant films of our times.  The movie is loosely based on the classic short story by H.G. Wells, but it surpasses its source in both scope and insight, while preserving the author's narrative style and thematic interests.  The story focuses on the work of a genetic engineer who escapes the restrictions of civilized society to create an island civilization populated by man-beasts of his own creation.  As the good doctor seeks to find and eliminate the gene that drives men to evil, his creations struggle with the duality of their natures.  Half man, half animal, they must choose between their primal urges and obedience to the law imposed by their creator.  Try to see the story through the eyes of the man-beasts and listen to the questions it's asking: Where does man fit on the scale between god and animal?  What is the function of law?  Can there be law without pain? Can there be law without God?  Also look for parallel characters to God, Satan, and Moses.  Is there a Christ figure in the story?

Here we have a top notch director (Frankenheimer), Brando ('nuff said), Val Kilmer (who has his moments, and is anything but wooden in this), Thewlis (underrated actor), Balk (underrated actress), a good score, good effects. Sure, most of the actors chew the scenery with glee, but that comes with the cinematic territory. Somehow, this all adds up to a really bad movie. How?I blame the screenwriter(s). For those of you who have seen the definitive Dr. Moreau movie, Island of Lost Souls, (which Wells hated, I might add), you will see how well this works. OK, question 1: Who is the antagonist? Dr. Moreau, right? Well, in the 1996 version, he dies about 30 minutes in. So the \"bad guys\" become the Dr's creations, who in every other version of the story are innocent victims of the antagonist (the Dr.) just like every one else. The message of this is that we should fear the animal people because they are different, not a particularly enlightened view. Question 2: Who is the hero? In the 1996 version its Edward Douglas. Makes sense, right? Except for one small detail: Douglas in every version of the story is a closed minded, moralizing holier-than-thou prick. There is just no way to get around it. If you think about the 1933 version, the real protagonists are the animal people, especially the Sayer of the Law and Aissa (she is called something else in that version), who GIVES HER LIFE to rescue the others as the other creation's desire for revenge on the doctor accidentally destroys the island. THEY are the moral compass of the movie, and they are more kind hearted and human than the human characters, who all in all are a pretty rotten bunch. Their only crimes are their ignorance and their circumstances. By contrast, the humans are actually evil: Moreau is a self centered psychopath, Montgomery has sold his soul, Edwards is an ungrateful pontificating ass. By contrast, Aissa and the Sayer of the law (in both versions) are polite, respectful of their creator and each other, brave, and helpful to those in need.  Can that be said about any of the human characters? By making a person like Edwards the protagonist and moral compass of the 1996 version, the film essentially endorses his rather nasty attitudes and ideas. Also, by portraying the creatures as motivated by a lust for destruction and power AFTER the Dr's death, it kills the sympathy the audience should feel for such tormented and abused beings.",

But in reality, this film turned out quite the opposite. It is rather pointless and boring, which hurts me to say, because I rather enjoyed the book. The many problems this film has are supposedly due to infinite clashes between the studio and the director, who eventually abandoned the project, leaving a vacancy for John Frankenheimer, who finished the picture. I guess it must be hard to finish a project that you haven't been involved in from the start, and it really shows. The scenes with Val Kilmer are painfully over the top, and David Thewlis and Fairuza Balk are not quite sure what they are doing either. The plot is practically non-existent, but it must have something to do with cloning, since they have an island with a giant laboratory on it for the purpose of \"designing\" new species of animals. Which brings me to few redeeming features of this film, being the phantastic special effects and animatronics (kudos to Stan Winston) and a truly dazzeling central performance by Marlon Brando, who seems to be born to play the role of the God-like Dr. Moreau. He delivers his (what appears to be) unrehearsed dialogue with such stunning ease, that it reminded me why he truly is one of the best actors of his generation.

It's got your interesting story, nice cinematography and reputable actors; unfortunately it's also snagged some-not-so impressive half-man/half-beast costumes and a varying level of success from said actors.In many cases Dr. Moreau's creations were bulked up too much and didn't move with as much agility as their computer animated counterparts would have you believe they possess. The effects crew would have been better off to tone down the muscles mass and concentrate on giving Moreau's creations more character. I enjoyed the wise goat-man get-up; although, how they passed up the idea of an owl-man with a graduation cap for that part, I'll never know.As for the acting, David Thewlis was great and provides an excellent lead character. He's an incredible actor and is currently holds my nomination for the position of Coolest British Accent.Marlon Brando joins us from his own far off island where his Big Mac funds were no doubt running low. I know that sounds cruel and Marlon, God knows I love ya, but this was far from a crowning achievement. His performance was okay but you'll forgive me if I expect more from freaking Marlon Brando. C'est la vie.Now, onto Val Kilmer. I'm not a big fan of Mr. Kilmer. His huge ego shows through in all of his work. I've enjoyed him in movies in which his character is *supposed* to be a tad on the egomaniacal side - specifically, \"Tombstone\" and \"Willow\" - and while his character, here, is supposed to have a fair-sized ego, this could well be one of his worst performances. He seems to spend the entire movie trying to impress Marlon Brando. You see, Brando has a tendency to improvise small things into his movies that really work; for example, in \"Last Tango in Paris\" with the gum on the balcony, or in \"On the Waterfront\" when he puts on the glove that his lady friend dropped. Here, Kilmer's varied improvisations tended to lean more towards the pointless and irritating side. Twirling the flower around in his mouth, balancing a radio component on his head. What's up with that? Oh, your character is supposed to be a little crazy too, huh, Val? That's great. Smack this upside the head for me, will ya, Mar? Thanks.This movie had the potential to be a excellent film but fell short. It's still an entertaining picture and worth watching but as far as stunning films with political and/or social statements go, Hollywood wouldn't be my first stop.",

Weighing in at close to 300 lbs. and covered in white kabuki style make-up Brando's role in this is borderline insane and pushes MOREAU well beyond being just another late '90's circa FX filled action pix into something that over time will be considered a real cinematic oddity. My favorite sequence is when he is playing a piano duet with the world's smallest man, something that probably inspired Michael Myers to create the character mini-me in the AUSTIN POWERS series.Cutting edge FX (for the time) by Stan Winston and brisk direction by John Frankenheimer, in one of his last outings overall position MOREAU as an enjoyable 100 minute plus ride for fantasy film fans and a must for Brando-philes.",

In other words, there's no reason whatsoever for this waste of celluloid to have been released on an unsuspecting public...or even for it to have been made in the first place.\"OK, wise-guy--what's so bad about it, then?\" Everything except the costumes. This was Brando's return to the full-blown inmates-running-the-asylum lunacy of Apocalypse Now, except there's precious little talent involved (save Brando's own long-squandered acting chops) or anything resembling an artistic vision to guide the horrible mess. What we get instead is a morbidly fascinating ego pile-up fueled by drugs and chaos--and did I mention that it's ineptly edited as well? You could start a whole new drinking game based on the inexplicable lingering blank looks, awkward pauses, and perplexing continuity gaps.

What's with Kilmer doing his freaky Brando impersonation when his character temporarily takes over the island? It would almost make sense except that it's Brando's Godfather character that he's doing(!). Why didn't anyone on-set have the cajones to tell Brando to quit f***ing around and take the g-ddam champagne bucket off of his head during the \"stupid hat\" scene? Why do the occasional chase scenes lack any suspense or excitement and just sort of end? Why do all the actors seem like they're completely blitzed on quaaludes and heroin? The inevitable impression one takes away from this movie is that no one was in charge, and the resulting film feels like watching a grown-up kindergarten populated by furry things who are all amped up on superhuman quantities of narcotics...and did I mention that the teacher's called in sick?

            "content": "The Island of Dr. Moreau is a very disturbing story, but the plot of the novel by H. G. Wells is even more disturbing. The premise of the book is that evolutionary advance is greatly accelerated by the experience of pain. For background, consider the \"dumb blonde\" stereotype - when a woman is exceptionally beautiful, everything is given to her on silver platters - she has no need to do anything but receive all of the good things offered to her on every hand, so she never has any need to develop any intelligence or talent. In contrast, a man who is unattractive, poor, and/or otherwise disadvantaged must constantly devise strategies for survival and growth, leading to sharper imaginative and cognitive skills.In the novel by H. G. Wells, Dr. Moreau cuts to the chase by administering pain to animals directly (at the \"House of Pain\"), in an effort to produce an adaptive response. Of course, this is a disturbing and chilling premise, but as the basis for a story it is pretty powerful, and it renders the development of the plot sufficiently plausible as to disturb one's sleep (or cause one to go running to Mama in terror).That, at least, was the original premise of the work by H. G. Wells, but the present production morphs that original premise into the combining of human genes with animals to create hybrid creatures. This film lacks all of the genius of H. G. Wells, and degenerates into an ordinary garden variety monster movie, targeted, presumably, at fourteen year old boys. Dumb movie producers think they know better than H. G. Wells, and the result is just frivolous junk.Fortunately, for fans of H. G. Wells, there is another and very excellent version of the story, Island of Lost Souls, 1932, featuring a delightful performance by Charles Laughton who totally nails the role of the gentleman mad scientist. This is the real deal. In fact, it was so disturbing to many people that the movie was banned for years. Compared with this achievement, the 1996 effort looks really stupid.",

Both my friend and I were very close to leaving early (which I have never voluntarily done), but we both stuck it out, in what in retrospect could only be described as pure masochistic fashion.

The novel had completely arrested my imagination and kept me turning page after page for three days.  The images and wonderful thought provoking concepts were still heavy in my mind.  So, my brothers had gone out to rent movies, and this one was in the stack.  I should have taken the hint when I noted that Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando were the stars.  Kilmer is probably one of the most disgraceful, unpleasant, unnatural and wooden actors I have seen since those awful 1950s romance pictures.  And Brando's talent is long since spent, and he makes a disgraceful spectacle and mockery of himself parading around in rediculous kabuki makeup draped in tarps.  Laughable.  I was to find out that these were the best parts of the picture.  When beginning the movie, I thought to myself, \"This is the 90s.  Surely they can make this film with integrity and special effects to serve the story.\"  I have hardly ever been so wrong.  The monster makeup was vaguely reminiscent of Wal Mart during Halloween season with lurid and cheap masks leering from all sides.  The special effects were slipshod and offensively cheap in appearance.  What bothered me the most was the updating of the plot.  Why do we always have to make things current? The thing is so much more effective as an 1800s tale of vivisection and domination rather than DNA splicing and computer chips.  Next time, just follow the book.  It would make so much more sense.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The film comes to a climax (?) involving some killing and some of the worst and incontinent editing yet in motion picture history. The film grinds to a halt getting bogged down in a jumbled mess of MTV flashes of dancing (!) animal men in some kind of techno - monster club.  As a film, this is repellent.  I read the book in three days, but got bored after the first half hour of this.  I think this is very high on the list of movies to be buried deep within the earth and forgotten.

The movie is squeezed into is timeframe in such a way that it left me wondering if parts had been cut out. So many things occur in a quick fashion. A good example is Montgomery (Kilmer). He slips over the edge for no apparent reason, shortly after Moreau is killed (in another laughable scene which fully illustrates what little attention Moreau pays to his creations; he prattles on to a team of rebelling creatures intent on killing him and ends up being partially devoured in his hammock). Thewlis's character (his name escapes me at the moment) discovers the lab on his first night on the island, after picking a lock and sneaking into an unlocked laboratory (!)Montgomery and other major figures, including Moreau's daughter and a hyena-man who led a revolt against Moreau, die pointless deaths near the movie's (anti-)climax.

The reactions from an astonished and perplexed industry, while watching this, must have been at least as rewarding as they were during Battlefield Earth.This is, truly, one of the worst films ever...",

            "content": "This is the first film I've commented on, and the reason I chose this one is that it is one of the worst I've seen.  I'm a big fan of the genre, as well as HG Wells and Brando, but the film is just silly.  The mutated life forms running, ranting and raving impart no feeling or emotion at all, except maybe laughter.  Val Kilmer is underused, as is Brando, their performances the only bright spot in the film.  The scenery and locale are pretty.  The foreshadowing spoils the plot, making the movie both predictable and confusing, quite a feat!  The allegory is also too thin, with an ending tacked on, just in case you didn't get it!",

            "content": "The costume design was patronizing and would have benifitted from 2000-era computer animation, but I thought the film was wonderful. I believe many would agree with me that this was a classic sci-fi sleeper hit. It was edgy, visually interesting, and it avoided tired cliches and much other standard movie fair. It was to the point and grabbing the entire way through. Many people didn't like this movie because it was too edgy, or it \"lacked a plot\". Many people called it garbage or a waste of time. But as all serious moviephiles know, you need to look deeper into the movies you watch. It's not just about being entertaining, it's about having an impact on the viewer. I highly reccomend this movie, simply because it's so different, so fresh, and so thought-provoking.",

I was very disapointed in him because he acts in such bad movies. Also Val Kilmer is a very  good actor, he was good in \"Top Secret\" and \"The Saint\", so I can't see why he acts this character in this movie. Wasted time, FORGET IT!",
