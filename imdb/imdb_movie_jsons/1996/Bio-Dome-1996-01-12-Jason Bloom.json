Sure there's lot's of silly moments and \"potty-humour\" jokes which may only appeal to 16 year old boys but still these lame jokes are done in such a \"light-hearted-let's-not-take-ourselves-too-seriously\" way which still manages to amuse and make me chuckle! There are also several cameos from actors who are now doing really well but were pretty much un-heard of back then such as a pre-fame version of \"Tenacious D\"!!! I'm actually quite surprised at the low user rating of 3.8 when movies like \"You don't mess with the Zohan\" which is possibly the worst film ever made manage to get over 5.0!!!! Bio-dome is a great \"swith-off your brain\" type of film which shouldn't be taken seriously at all. So crank out the beers or the bong or both and just zone into the dome!",

The story is simple and tries to be a crusade for world ecological preservation but does nothing for the message.The story is terrible. Bud (pauly Shore) and Doyle (Stephen Baldwin) are to morons who have just been ditched by there girl friends and are down on there luck. They take a drive out to a dump to find the girls not cleaning there. On the way back home Doyle has to go to the bathroom so they pull over at what looks like to be a new mall. Instead it is Bio-Dome, an ecological preservation center and now Bud and Doyle are locked inside with four scientists.They cause chaos and homeostasis drops until somehow the idiots realize what they're doing and are able to become top scientists over night. I wanted to to throw up after seeing this. Pauly Shore is annoying beyond belief and Baldwin should really think twice about being an actor or working at a gas station. The film fails on all levels of comedy and acting and should be avoided by everyone.Bio-Dome. Starring: Pauly Shore, Stephen Baldwin, William Atherton, Kylie Minogue, and Denise Dowse.1/2 out of 5 Stars.",

            "content": "Stupid is, as stupid does is the theme in this movie. Its a universally hated film that has been panned by every critic around. Common slapstick and farce driven movies tend to be negative targets for critics, but this one is ultimately at the top of its list for the category. Im talking about Bio-Dome. A strangely amusing movie about two stoners dealing with the environment (great combination).Idiot collegians, Bud Macintosh (Pauly Shore) and Doyle Johnson (Stephen Baldwin). Residing in Arizona, the duo are in hot water with their girlfriends, Monique (Joey Lauren Adams) and Jen (Teresa Hill) after a desperate excuse to get out of helping the environment on Earth Day. The duo prove they can by venturing across Arizona in which they become locked inside a Bio-Dome, in which they mistake for a mall.The duo are unable to leave the dome seeing as the workers must remain in their for exactly a year. If contracted with \"outside air\" the experiment will be ruined. Naturally, the duo are carefree and decide to screw around in the enclosed case as if it's their prime home. The workers get aggravated, and try to cope with the duo. But they are so irresponsible and unreliable it's and unbelievable frustration.As much as I heard Luke warm to abysmal reviews, I just had to watch it and give my honest opinion about it. I actually tolerated the entire thing. To my knowledge, this was originally set to be the third Bill and Ted film in the franchise. We can call this the scrapped Bill and Ted, or the Bill and Ted spin off. Regardless, it's a fun, rulefree movie, that shouldn't be taken seriously. As well as being just a fun movie, with good ol' stoner humor. Pre-Half Baked.Starring: Pauly Shore, Stephen Baldwin, William Atherton, Joey, Lauren Adams, and Kylie Minogue. Directed by: Jason Bloom.",

            "content": "Oh, my mind, my mind, 2+2=4, wait, does it? I think it equals 19? I'm not sure, I've lost so many brain cells while watching this movie. One of my friends had mentioned this movie to me, we were talking about how some stoner flicks are fun, he mentioned Biodome. I had never heard of it, but he said that he saw it once in junior high and it was hilarious, so I was kind of curious to see it. Pauly Shore, the guy is annoying but can sometimes be funny, so I figured I would have an open mind to it. Now here's the thing about this movie that I'm still trying to figure out, I did not laugh once, I didn't even laugh at the sheer stupidity of this film, is that even possible? I just ended up crying so hard after this movie, I couldn't believe how stupid this movie was. When I called my friend, he said that it was funny in junior high at least, I don't know, maybe I did give the film too much credit from the get go, but judging from the rating on IMDb, I don't think I'm alone on how stupid this movie is.Doyle and Bud are best friends who pull a stunt to get out of Earth Day activities with their Earth conscious girlfriends, Monique and Jen. When the girls find out about it, they decide to get even by pretending to have met two men at the event and gave Bud and Doyle a red herring location. The two leave to go after them but soon realize they were fooled. On the way home, they pull off the road at the Bio-Dome, which they mistake for a mall, and are turned away by a security guard at the entrance. They get around this by using firecrackers as a distraction and by the time they are ready to leave, they find they have been sealed inside.The scientists, and chief investor Mr. Dick Leaky, discuss what to do about the situation. Mr. Leaky wants the two out immediately. The scientist in chief, Dr. Noah Faulkner, decides since the experiment depends on the time of one year, they must stay and the system will have to adapt to 7, not 5, people. This soon proves to be a mistake as Bud and Doyle aren't the most environmentally friendly guests.I just will never get how anyone could ever find this movie funny, Stephen Baldwin and Pauly Shore have no chemistry what so ever and their stupidity is more annoying rather than funny. Every scene where they're screwing up something for these scientists made me want to punch them and the fact that the girl scientists(that are Victoria Secret rejects) find them hot is just\u0085 I can't even come up with a word, forgive my low IQ on this one, this is what Bio-Dome has done to me. I really tried to give this movie a chance, I accepted this absurd plot and tried to go with everything, but it's just impossible when the two main characters have no chemistry. At a time when Beavis and Butt-Head were really popular, I think people were trying to cash in on the stoner audience, but while Beavis and Butt-Head were clever and was a stupid funny situation with them, Pauly and Stephen just don't work well together. Just to think of the money spent on this film that could have gone to starving children, the sick, the poor, the homeless, the abused, education\u0085 well, if I continue on what else the money budget could have been spent on, I'm wasting time when I could be reading a novel trying to get my brain cells back. As you can tell, I'm not going to be kind with this rating, believe me, this movie wasted my time and if I ever see the director, I am going to take the DVD case and beat him to death with this movie.1/10",

Just a fun film, or a film that was kind of bad but it was a kind of guilty pleasure. Instead, Bio-Dome is excruciatingly awful with little redeeming values.The acting is terrible. Pauly Shore is a real problem with this movie, I never liked his acting style and this movie has done nothing for me to say otherwise. He is annoying to the point that I wanted to reach into the television and put a hand over his mouth. Stephen Baldwin fares no better, all he does is act gormless, clueless and annoying and the shtick dies fast. What's even worse is that the chemistry between the two men is non-existent. Joey Lauren Adams is the sole bright spot.Another major failing is the humour. The humour just ruins Bio-Dome just on its own. It isn't just the diabolical script but also the unfunny jokes and slip-shod, juvenile physical comedy. The pace is often too rushed, the direction is awful and the story is incredibly predictable and made of a series of disconnected sequences.The characters are badly written and very clich\u00e9d and one-dimensional, and emotionally I couldn't engage with them on any conceivable level. The film looks cheap as well, and musically the movie is very forgettable.In conclusion, a real mess of a comedy and of a film that fails in every asset. While not the worst movie I've seen, it is certainly one of the most annoying. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Everyone who worked on this abomination should be thrown in a concentration camp and be experimented on for the rest of their unnatural lives.This film is supposed to be a comedy, but it's not. Not one single line of dialogue is funny, every performance is terrible, and the plot is virtually non-existent. The film revolves around two main characters, who are locked in the \"Bio-Dome\". They are played by Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin, who both do a terrible job. Their acting is beyond dreadful, their characters are complete lunatics, and not one single thing they say, or do is even remotely funny. The same goes for the other idiots who appeared in this picture.It's really a mystery to me why some people like this rubbish. It's like it was made by some sick person, who wanted to create the best torture method to be used in Guantanamo Bay. There was nothing in this film that I liked.

I like Shore and his movies, they do their job and provide entertainment and are never boring, no matter how moronic they appear to be.This was one reason for me to watch this movie, the second was to see the biggest career nosedive in recent memory. Hello Stephen Baldwin. One minute, your in an Oscar winning movie, next your Playing Garth to Shores Wayne.It's silly stuff, but it's never boring and it's heart is in the right place. Shore seems to be having a whale of a time, which shows he loves his work, just like Sandler.The biggest surprise in this movie is that the guy you think will be a sleaze (Atherton, who clearly is in Ghostbusters and Die Hard 1&2) is quite lenient with the pair for the majority of the movie, which is good, because it has some originality to it.But all in all, it's a dumb movie, offering nothing new into the stoner buddy comedy, but it has some charm to it, and the cast have great chemistry and there is a message to all of this.it's never dull like a lot of comedies, but it's not for everyones taste.

The cast of this movie was very well chosen, Stephen Baldwin?s acting career skyrocketed into five star movies like Slap Shot 2.  Pauly Shore gives us wonderful advice for everyone to learn for example, \"We have chippees, we have chippess, we have lots of stuff to eat.\" This quote is so deep and meaningful it made me go buy chips and repeat the quote 45 times.  Many lifelong lessons can be learned from viewing this movie several hundred times.  I have learned that if a person wants to help save the environment all they have to do is throw a very large party for saving the rainforests.  Also I learned that I have to be careful when I am driving and I have to drain my lizard I should make sure I am not going to be trapped in a Bio-Dome because I might have to stay there for a whole year!

            "content": "A prime example of the \"stoner comedy.\" This was a rather strange genre of movies which placed immature and unmotivated Gen-X white males (privileged, in today's parlance) into odd situations, and chronicled the hijinks which followed, in hit or miss fashion.We can probably trace the roots to Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, with Cheech and Chong and Bob and Doug McKenzie perhaps being the grandfathers. Other examples include Wayne's World, Encino Man, Airheads, Mallrats, In the Army Now, Jury Duty, Billy Madison, Grandma's Boy, Happy Gilmore, Dude, Where is My Car?, the Harold & Kumar series, and so on. MTV's Beavis & Butthead capitalized on the same phenonium in cartoon format.The genre might seem perplexing now but it was very popular during its heyday. Paulie Shore, Brendan Fraser, Adam Sandler, Mike Judge, and Kevin Smith all owe their fortunes to it. And the rest of us perhaps a slight loss of IQ points to it.If Clerks represents the high end of the spectrum, then Bio-Dome represents the low end. The movie is definitely dumb as hell, and it's sub-5 point rating accurately sums it up. Still though, I give it a 5 because it might be worth watching now. It's a historical curiosity for one thing. The movie is very Gen X. I suspect that Millennials and Gen Zers might find it hard to relate to and more of a novelty, and thus perhaps less annoying than intelligent people did nearly 25 years ago. And those who were around at the time might find it more tolerable now since they're not being subjected to Paulie Shore and these types of movies on a regular basis like they were back then.Also, if today's shrill Green New Deal progressives annoy you in any way, this movie might actually be something of a treat. The movie and the two buffones who serve as its protagonists of course make a complete and utter mockery out of the subject of environmentalism and those who have dedicated their lives to the cause. So depending on your disposition, it may be worth taking a trip back in time if it's on Netflix for free.",

I have braved worse before, such as some of the other Paul Shore movies out there. If you can sit through Jury Duty, you'll have no problem watching this. Not that I would recommend putting yourself through such an unnecessary hell.Bio Dome was absolutely torturous. It's not meant to be taken seriously, but I'm convinced that you would either have to be retarded, or have recently had a lobotomy to enjoy this movie. Movies that have plots that can be summed up in one sentence usually aren't that great to begin with. Here's the whole synopsis: Two stoners go into a bio dome and then come out some time later. Nothing else worthy of mentioning happens, believe me.There have to be better forms of entertainment than this. Go outside and run yourself into exhaustion.

            "content": "I used to like movies like this, as a kid, due to the idea of living life in a control ecosystem. However, after rewatching it. It hasn't aged well since then. According to some sources, 1996's 'Bio-Dome' directed by Jason Bloom, was supposed to be a serious character study movie about scientists trying to survival in a Plato's Allegory of the Cave bio-dome environment, while also trying to keep their sanity together. Something similar to 2013's 'Under the Dome' TV Series. Instead, the executives at Motion Picture Corporation of America decided for the film to make money, it had to become a comedy. In short, they wanted to make another low brow hit, similar to their earlier films, 1994's 'Dumb & Dumber'. Because of this, the plot was change to revolve around two clumsy, dim-witted slackers, Bud \"Squirrel\" Macintosh (Pauly Shore) and Doyle \"Stubs\" Johnson (Stephen Baldwin) getting trap for a whole year in a closed ecological structure with a bunch of scientists, when they mistake it for a shopping mall. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while the whole environmentalism message, still somewhat existed in this film; it was water down by the extreme insufferable behavior of the two leads, even after they supposedly better themselves. We're meant to see Bud and Doyle as the good guys, but I can't help myself, cheering against them and going with the villain, Dr. Noah Faulkner (William Atherton). His actions to get rid of them, kinda does make sense to me. These two, are really awful. Don't get me wrong, Bud & Doyle do have a morality tale character arch, but they spend way too much of the movie, being annoying, and not funny. The lame totally radical cheesy dialogue mixed with the cringe-worth sexual innuendo, and juvenile toilet humor from some of the worst. Not only do, they act like ridiculously irresponsible children, for most of the movie; they are very disrespectful towards their sexy girlfriends, Monique (Joey Lauren Adams) and Jen (Teresa Hill) by willing to cheat on them. Plus, their unprovoked groping/attempted rape of the female scientists, Dr. Petra von Kant (Kylie Minogue) & Mimi Simkins (Dara Tomanovich) in their sleep is really disturbing. While, I like all the actresses that were in this film. I just don't understand, how, any of these women characters can find them, attractive after that!? There were no good reason, for the female scientists to egg the male-scientists, to keep them around. Honestly, the scientists should had been kicked the duo, out of the titular Bio-Dome as they break in, and the movie would be over in 15 minutes. They weren't no reason, why scientists couldn't reset the timer, a few minutes later, while the police arrested them, as there isn't much longtime effects, happening. Plus, it would prevent them, from practically destroy the Bio-Dome that the scientists put all that hard work into developing, later in the film. Not only that, but it doesn't make sense, why the scientists would continue the project after Bud & Doyle ruined it. The yearlong scientific record is still pretty tainted, no matter, how much, they clean the Bio-Dome. Also, there is the fact that there is an open door, in what's supposed to be a self-contained ecology is a big problem. So why is the scientists continuing to work on the Bio-Dome!? I guess, it's because they need to cover up the mess from the investors!? Isn't that 'fraud'? Wouldn't the investors find out, anyways, when the scientific record come out and an investigation of the bomb-plot come out!? Anyways, that wasn't the only thing, wrong with this movie. The movie is extremely dated. Everything looks like a bad 1990s commercial. The 1990s MTV quick-style editing with everything on screen, being tossed into your face as if it's trying to be a 3D movie was awful. You can't really see, what it is, before the object or text, disappears, a second later. Even the effects were bad; the strobing lights are pretty blinding. Plus, it will can potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. The cinematic credits looks like a ransom letter. Also, what was the deal with the random sound effects!? Why is there, a baby cry in the film!? This movie has nothing, to do with infants! Also, what was the deal with the one random flash back!? Also, what was the deal, of hiring ex- brain wash bank robber/terrorist turn actress for a small bit part!? Was Doyle's mom (Patricia Hearst) supposed to have, a bigger role!? Another awful thing about this movie is the music choice. The alternative rock mixed with punk song from the bands, 'Fourth Grade Nothing', 'Dance Hall Crashers', & \"Wax\" were headache to listen to. Also, I know, a lot of people like the band, 'Tenacious D', but I'm not a huge fan of their comedy music. I find them, very unfunny. I found their cameo presence in the movie to be brainless and pointless. The same goes with the random cameos of Rose McGowan, Roger Clinton and others. They didn't add much to the story, nor were they funny. Overall: This was the film that finally derailed both Pauly Shore's and Stephen Baldwin's short careers. Thank goodness. I just can't comprehend how stupid, this movie was. Nor could I advise, watching it, even today. It's a movie that is better left forgotten in the past.",

In fact, anything Malcolm McDowell did with a newlywed couple and a fistful of mashed potatoes in CALIGULA was a thousand times funnier than the collective 'jokes' of BIO-DOME.Movies like this always raise frightening questions. Why is Pauly Shore still paid to appear in movies when the world, by now, should have made him feel unsafe in going outdoors lest a crippling injury befall him? Why is Stephen Baldwin still beating his career to death with inane projects like THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS after a terrific stint in THE USUAL SUSPECTS?

            "content": "It's not a movie with a lot of problems. The matters, that I hated, weren't many.Firstly, the 2 leads. It's a basis in Hollywood, rather the world, that you know what's loved about you and utilize it. Pauly Shore became famous due to his special style of talking and joking on MTV. It's not a bad thing till you do it ALL THE TIME. I kept thinking that this time the script's actual material was ignored, to have these unceasing awful antics of Shore, along with his co-star too. Well, they were loose, totally loose, to do whatever they wanted, and the problem is that what they did want was disastrous. They acted as drunken baboons; that could have been good, but the outcome was so loud scream of a performance!Believe it or not, despite delivering unfunny imbecility here, I could stand Shore, but Stephen Baldwin OH MY GOD! By selecting him, the movie died, and with his acting, it has been mutilated! He was Pauly Shore's ugliest impersonator EVER, doing what I consider as the lowest pathetic comedy, being the real evil of this movie. Why didn't they bring a co-star with a talent or charisma?!! It was annoying enough to just look at him. So with Shore and Baldwin, it was like a half of a smile, mixed with a complete grin!Secondly, the taste of the comedy for some moments, rather the tasteless comedy. I mean, resorting to nudity isn't any comic at all; it's disgusting and disgraceful! (How come that nudity is allowed in the PG-13 movies?, I have no idea!).Thirdly, some minor flaws in the script. For instance: what are the jobs of the leads? How they got all of that money to make the big party at the bio-dome? Why exactly William Atherton, as the manager scientist, gone crazy at the end? And the strange transformation of the 2 leads?? They suddenly became great humans out of ruination's machines?!On the other hand, the Bio-Dome, as a place, looked really fresh and unusual. The basic plot was smart. The pace was fast. The soundtrack, with non-stop rock all the way, succeeded in making the movie a lot faster and lively, managing to fill the gaps of the blank, supposedly droll, moments.It fits being a study about the bourgeois's dullness. Through the movie's sketches, even if they were shoddy, you can feel the bored-to-death, well-off kids, the out of work spoiled youth, the lazy couch potato's mentality. Sometimes the 2 leads represented a different breed of savages, being the 20th centenary's new cavemen. Actually, their idiot texts; namely the language they speak, the moves their bodies do, the games they play,...etc--seemed taken directly from an authentic brat's diary, most probably Shore himself, which's maybe the highest \"truthful\" thing that this movie has. However, as a whole, some will laugh or smile, seeing themselves in these eccentric behaviors, and some won't!It follows the footsteps of the stupid 2 buddies' formula. This formula kind of hit the American cinema since the late 1980s, where the 2 comic leads are no singing prince charming and a joke of a sidekick, intelligent and dumb, handsome and bizarre, or in brief: not having the Mickey Mouse and Goofy's mix anymore. With Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991), they turned into 2 perfectly goofy goofs. Dumb & Dumber (1994) was a peak for the newborn fashion, which encouraged the producers so powerfully to make more money and dumb heroes. So it's not a surprise that much of Bio-Dome was taken from the scrapped third movie in the Bill & Ted trilogy.Now look at the career of Pauly Shore. His first starry role was in (Encino Man - 1992), it grossed $40.6 million. In the next year, (Son in Law - 1993) groused $36.4 million. Then (In the Army Now - 1994) did $28.8 million, (Jury Duty - 1995) did $17 million, and finally (Bio-Dome - 1996) did $13.4 million. It seems as if Hollywood consumed all of its chances with him, giving him 5 movies in 5 years, with fewer profits every time. I think in the first 4 movies, there were auxiliary troops or side elements to help the guy out. Unluckily, this time, he got the most awful one ever; Mr. Stephen Baldlose! Not to mention that Shore nearly wrote all the dialogue, or dealt with the already written gags terribly. Otherwise this is the rock bottom of dialogue in a cinematic comedy!Bio-Dome isn't totally unwatchable or that bad, it is originally a good movie swept by a storm of redundant stupidity. However, it can overcome its little hell of problems to be bearable and amusing for utterly goofy 88 minutes. It's similar to a small bag of potato chips, well, chips with the mustard flavor! Anyway, historically speaking, Adam Sandler and Jim Carry began as downright morons in many movies, then moved on. Pauly Shore began as the same, then stopped. Maybe he's unlucky fellow, or maybe he's simply a moron. Unfortunately this movie assures that he's both!",

The movie is brilliant in this capacity. Who doesn't love a farting scene? Want some funny pick-up lines? How about a chase? Maybe likable characters? This movie has it all. Plus, it will make you feel much smarter and will have made you laugh at least once. Anyone who says this movie is not worth watching does not know how to enjoy everything in life. Bio Dome is a funny display of those people in high school that you thought would never amount to anything might actually be as adults. And it's even better because you can laugh freely, without guilt. I highly recommend this movie to anyone in the mood to laugh just for laughing's-sake.",

Granted, none of his work will ever win a SAG or an Oscar, but this was low even for him. The movie centers around to druggie slackers who end up crashing an environmental experiment known as the Bio Dome. By the time they are discovered, it is too late to cast the buffoons out as the dome has already been sealed, which it will be for the duration of the one year experiment. Shore and Baldwin manage to annoy everyone and sabotage the whole experiment. They do, however, find time to do interesting activities such as pass gas and smell the noxious odors in order to figure out what the person passing gas has eaten.In the end, these two loser manage to right all the wrongs, become celebrities, and get the girls who left them because they were so lame.

Stephen Baldwin is the brother everyone forgets. William Atherton was still dining out on Die Hard. It's all a big melting pot of facets that don't work, and they didn't in 1996.But it does in 2018. It's a stupid film, it's a film only to be watched when you want to watch something stupid. Think of it like Wayne's World, it's a riot of stereotypical nineties grungey nonsense that you don't want to relate with but still somehow do.We live in a world today where everything always seems so serious and everything always seems like it is beset by problems. We originally thought films like this were garbage simply because there were a lot more things that were funny in those days. It's not like that today so watch something like Bio-Dome, it's only 95 minutes of your life.

No, it's not very witty. No, it's not very 'good'. On the other hand, i don't think the creators every imagined that it would be any of those things. It's a fun romp in the style of which you can expect from Pauly Shore. I think perhaps the best genre that it can be placed in is 'stoner comedy', so if you're a stoner, you'll probably crack up watching it. The creators were trying to make something fun, nothing to be taken seriously, and they pulled it off. We can't judge all movies against the Godfather (#1 of IMDBs 250 best movies list). Try imagine what they were trying to achieve, and you'll see that they did a fantastic job. So, as far as the genre is concerned, it's pretty fantastic, if a bit 'disney'.

A failed internet stunt is less painful than sitting through this mess, and no more likely to leave you with brain damage.Bud and Doyle are our two everyman heroes, assuming every guy is a nitwit with no job and Joey Lauren Adams for a girlfriend. And like the rest of us nitwits, Bud and Doyle just want to party while the Earth goes to hell on a fast train. There is a potential cautionary tale about environmental awareness in there somewhere, but it gets lost amidst our duo's goofy but unfunny antics. Bud and Doyle make the cast of Jackass look like Laurel and Hardy by comparison.After a few misunderstandings and much time-wasting non-hilarity, our duo find themselves locked in a sealed environment with five scientists who are studying environmental sustainability. Two of the scientists are played by popstar Kylie Minogue and former model Dara Tomanovich, and if I ever find out which graduate school they attended, I may go back to school. But our boys just want to have dumb fun and proceed to trash the place. Again, the idea that this whole movie might actually be a social allegory about man partying over Mother Nature's deathbed may occur to those viewers who are still aware of their surroundings, but it quickly gets lost thanks to several long scenes involving Pauly Shore not being funny.This whole business goes on for ninety fairly painful minutes. You can usually tell whether a movie succeeded as entertainment by watching the audience as it leaves the theatre. If a movie is a think piece, everybody looks thoughtful. Patrons of comedies tend to leave in an upbeat mood. The audience for Bio Dome looked lobotomized.

It could used some more creativity during this part, but everything else in the movie makes it worth it.If you're a fan of silly comedies, college humour, and slapstick, then you definitely need to give this movie a go.

So unbelievable that it's funny?  Nope, sorry but no.  So, finally realise they've done wrong, they try hard in the remaining time of the project to put things right.

            "content": "Two twentysomething slackers Bud (Pauly Shore) and Doyle (Stephen Baldwin) are content in their lifestyle of lazy stupidity while their girlfriends Monique (Joey Lauren Adams) and Jen (Teresa Hill) try to take up causes to save the environment often trying to get Bud and Doyle involved. When Jen and Monique become fed up with Bud and Doyle's latest lame excuse for not joining them on an Earth Day cleanup, the two decide to play a trick on them by calling them and claiming they've been invited to a kegger party with swim team athletes. As Bud and Doyle go to the kegger location only to realized they've been had, the two head on home only stopping for a bathroom break at what they think is a shopping mall, but in actuality is a experiment called Bio-Dome headed by Dr. Noah Faulkner (William Atherton) and his team of scientists. As the Bio-Dome is sealed off for one year with the mission being to maintain 100% homeostasis in a simulation of the Earth's ecosystem, the scientists react with horror that they've been sealed in with Bud and Doyle. Unable to \"compromise the integrity of the experiment\", the scientists decide to continue on with the experiment with Bud and Doyle living in the Bio-Dome alongside them for a whole year, unprepared for the chaos and destruction the two bring with them.The debut project of writers Kip Koenig and Scott Marcano, Bio-Dome was one of a number of slacker themed buddy comedies you saw released throughout the 90s with the likes of Bill & Ted, Dumb and Dumber, Beavis and Butthead, and various others that defined that era's comedy. The movie is pretty ingrained in that mindset down to the fact the producers on the film, Brad Krevoy and Steven Stabler, also produced Dumb and Dumber and it's clear this is an attempt to recapture the same zeitgeist that gave Krevoy and Stabler their mammoth hit. Unfortunately while the movie has all the stupid and gross of a movie like Beavis and Butthead or Dumb and Dumber, it can't bring the humor or charm of those films and gives us 90 minutes of non-stop annoyance and unfunniness.There's really not much of a plot to Bio-Dome as its just a string of sequences loosely strung together of Bud and Doyle being stupid resulting in either poorly timed slapstick or attempts at annoying other characters. Our two lead characters are charmless, mean-spirited, careless, and cynical, and while the movie is aware of it as it builds a very loose environmentalist theme (I think, it feels pretty disingenuous to be honest) we still need to want to watch a movie with these characters and they're not funny and instead are just grating and annoying especially with how often they'll laugh at their own jokes or stunts. Beavis and Butthead had their characters laughing at their own stupid antics, but Mike Judge knew that alone wasn't enough to sustain the premise and created supporting characters and relationships to bounce against those character traits, and when he expanded it to feature length with Beavis and Butthead Do America he placed the two against engaging and fleshed out characters played by recognizable actors serving as straight men to their antics. While there is an attempt (albeit a poor one) to make William Atherton's Dr. Noah Faulkner and his team of scientists straight men to Bud and Doyle, they aren't unlikable and frankly I felt more sympathy for the scientists getting groped, pranked, or harassed by Bud and Doyle's stupidity rather than any humor. What laughs I got were only ancillary at best with some of Henry Gibson's line readings eliciting the odd smirk (it's Henry Gibson, not the material) or a brief \"blink and you'll miss it\" appearance by Jack Black and Kyle Gass' Tenacious D.There's really nothing to Bio-Dome other than loud, obnoxious stupidity. If you want stupid screwball antics, you're pretty spoiled for choice with the likes of Ace Ventura, Police Academy, UHF, Dumb and Dumber, Wayne's World, Beavis & Butthead, Bill Ted, or dozens upon dozens of other comedies that have done this sort of thing better and with more charm.",

The director actually went on to make another one of my favorite movies \"overnight delivery\" which most agree is actually quite clever. I think because Pauly Shore is in this film people decide to give it a bad rep...but guys...Pauly's paid by the backlash in society on his films. He's even made a movie about the world hating him so can't we just accept this movie as semi-clever? The movie is actually funny. It's funny in this strange way. Pauly Shore has a certain sense of humor, and its a clever and strange thing. It's not genius and its not Adam Sandler but it's on the same level. You just have to watch Bio-Dome with the expectations that its going to be stupid. You can't go into every expecting it to be pure comic brillance. Not everybody is Kevin Smith, but if you hate Pauly Shore and you hate Bio Dome you probably hate Adam Sandler and Kevin Smith. And I mean.... then you surely must hate life, right? Some movies just are what they are. Bio-Dome just is what it is, its a weird little movie thats still funny because its so absurd. The concept of living in a bio-dome for a year? It's just funny. It's a certain brand of comedy that I just don't see enough of anymore and I wish they did make at least one Bio-Dome comedy every year. Bio-Dome doesn't deserve to be on the IMDB 100 worst ever list. It's cheese, it's funny, and it's STILL played on TV because its funny.\nMaybe it's a movie you can only understand if your in the industry or a TV geek, because you'll get a few chuckles at little references thrown in (I mean come on, their COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS, isn't that funny in itself?)\nHonestly... and maybe this is just my opinion, but DUMB AND DUMBER deserves to be on the worse 100 list. Bio-Dome doesn't Dumb And Dumber... just isn't funny. While Bio-Dome was hillarious when I first saw it, and still remains funny to this day. VIVA-LOS-BIO-DOME!",

            "content": "Hands down, one of the worst comedies to ever grace the silver screen, at least back in the 1990s, was the Pauly Shore / Stephen Baldwin led disaster, Bio-Dome. Made around the height of Shore's now barely relevant career, the film was met with extremely negative reviews and barely made much of a profit. Nowadays, it has received somewhat of a cult following, although that may only be from truly die hard fans of the weasel's schtick, since even some people from the MTV generation barely even mention the flick nowadays. Then again, that might be for the best, because this movie is far from a pleasant experience.The film follows two clumsy, dim-witted slackers, named Bud \"Squirrel\" MacIntosh (Shore) and Doyle \"Stubs\" Johnson (Baldwin). Upon driving by a shopping mall, which turns out to be a \"bio-dome\" being used to hermetically seal five ecological scientists for a year, the two end up in there by accident and cause all sorts of mayhem. While that sounds like a potentially funny promise in its own regard, the film is anything but humorous, as Bud and Doyle are far too stupid to be passable as charming and way too irrepsonsible to find any sense of sympathy from. Them getting themselves locked in the bio-dome from their own dumb volition is one thing, but a lot of the hijinks and shenanngians they get themselves into around the otherwise level headed scientists range from annoying to down right despicable. It's a really sad day when your main \"protagonists\" are so irritatingly incorrigible that the antagonistic Dr. Noah Faulkner (William Atheron) actually ends up being worth routing in wanting to get rid of them altogether. Juvenile antics do not automatically equal charming heroes.In addition to the bio-dome reflecting ecology within its containment, the film tries to have a sense of morality by making Bud and Doyle's girlfriends Monique and Jen environmental activists who want them to man up and do what's right for the planet Earth. There are some moments around the second half where Bud and Doyle do their best to redeem the dome with the help of the other scientists, but even beyond that, any feeling of emotions feels either non-existent or extremely forced in a weak attempt to tackle heavy handed issues. Also, the question as to why Monique and Jen would even bother remaining with Bud and Doyle in the first place is only further complicated when they screw things up so horribly. In all honesty, it's really hard to take anything in this kind of movie even remotely seriously when half of it is just Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin being inappropriately moronic and frantic, while simultaenously torturing the scientists. Any blend of important messages were just thrown out the window in lieu of college toilet humor and humorless innuendos.It's interesting to note that Pauly Shore himself stated that although he had fun times making Bio-Dome, it was far from a pleasant experience in the long run later down his life. Considering his claim to fame is merely MTV stardom and early 90s stoner comedies, there's a reason flicks like Bio-Dome don't really age well in the grand scheme of things. Even for a wacky stoner delinquent comedy, this film is horrendously irritating in both its content and is cast. I'm sure there are plenty of people who dig this film for all of its lunacy and nuttiness, but it just doesn't do it for today's generation.",

There's barely any attempt at a joke here. The best part about the movie is the Tenacious D cameo, that's pretty much it. The rest of the film is just these two dunderheads acting like idiots the whole time. And no, it's not entertainingly bad, because the film is also boring. It's only an hour an a half but it felt like an eternity because the whole film is basically filler, they're just goofing around all day.

            "content": "Imagine two of the most stupid, whiny, obnoxious, so-annoying-you- want-to-gauge-their-tiny-brains-out-with-a-spoon type characters. Imagine if they communicated in NOTHING but 90's 'dude'slang, and dressed like the worst excesses of that decade. Imagine if all they talk about was urination, defecation, drugs, alcohol, and sex. Especially that last one (although, why any lady with a pulse would give them anything other than a kick in the 'nads' is beyond me.) Imagine being stuck with them in a closed-off, secure area for a year, and having to listen to them, smell them, see them.... TALK to them... For all that time...Ladies and gentlemen, I think I've just discovered the scenario where I could commit murder and legitimately not give a sh*t. The best part is... Not a jury in the world would convict me. In fact, there might just be a queue of Christians and Buddhists stretching round the block, just to poke their lifeless corpses with a stick. They really are that hateful.But what with this being a script dragged from out of the Twilight Zone, where being a complete moron is somehow attractive to the opposite sex, these idiots have to TURN DOWN most of the attention they get from the opposite gender. You see, they're babe magnets... But they're also faithful to their girlfriends. Bless. Amongst the ladies spurned are one Kylie Minogue... And you can forget Neighbours and her early pop career, THIS will forever be the nadir of her existence. Even if she got convicted of chicken molesting tomorrow, starring in Bio Dome will NEVER be topped in terms of her personal Hall Of Shame.So anyway, our two 'heroes' (Never have I used the term so loosely) get trapped inside a dome for 365 days with some scientists. Inside, is every hippy's wet dream... A completely self maintained environment with plants, cattle and clean air. Needless to say, it takes the pair of bozos less than a month to mess everything up... They contaminate the water, kill all the wildlife and hold a MASSIVE party which virtually destroys the greenery. Nice job, guys. And we're meant to LIKE these nimrods?Not to worry, though. Because this is a movie WITH A MESSAGE, redemption isn't too long in coming. And, in the most unlikely, far- fetched ways, they use the rubbish left over from their big bash to revive this wannabe Garden Of Eden, and become national heroes in the process. How they figure out how to use all this litter to save the day despite being clueless about all things environmentally, or why they're suddenly lauded for clearing up THEIR OWN MESS is a complete mystery, but those little plot holes aren't the worst problems here by a LONG shot. Oh, no.It's not funny. It will never be funny. Even at the time of it's release, I doubt anyone was laughing. I know I keep banging on about this, but our central duo are HORRIBLE. Their puerile conversations are on the level of a toddler, and their immature behaviour makes a crying baby seem sophisticated. I can't really explain it... You have to see them, to believe them. It's HATE at first sight. You want to physically harm these people... Even though you KNOW they're just actors playing a role (Incidentally, did Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin have any idea how irritating they were while playing these wretched parts? Apparently not. It's amazing how blind you can be when you have a moderate pay check dangled in front of you).Their 'change of heart' comes completely out of left field, and is only inserted to provide Greenpeace with a happy ending. Besides, even after their conversation to saving the planet, they're STILL just as grating as ever. As is the pacing, (The first month in the dome takes around an hour in length, the other eleven elapse in less than half of that) the supporting roles, (the girls in the film only exist to fawn all other the two douchebags and try and sleep with them... Yes, even the allegedly 'strong, independent' female scientists), the script, (Who thought THIS awful story was worth making into a movie? Someone must LOVE wasting money) In fact, pretty much everything.It's just a colossal FAIL from top to bottom, a film which should be laughed at and despised until the Earth DOES end.Which will be a lot quicker, if crap like this is the best they've got as propaganda... 1/10",

The cast is brilliant and Shore/Baldwin are comedy geniuses. Bio-dome has such an outlandish (yet original) plot that I'd STILL prefer over the majority of comedies made in the last 10 years.The movie is full of satire/spoof/reference humor that I think people misinterpreted for adult humor. I put this style of comedy in the Dude, Where's my Car? Or Bill and Ted style. Two idiots find themselves in a situation far beyond their intelligence - which is the golden formula.

What I really hated was Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin. They did absolutely nothing but do some stupid stunts and tell awful jokes for 90 minuets. Who wrote this movie? Every line isn't funny at all. You know you failed when your main characters being left to die in a desert climate is the only part I was happy you failed. The first rule of writing characters is to make us like them, especially if it's a main character. Another thing I hated was the two girlfriends, those two are hot, and they are dating two idiots who any normal person would want in a mental institution.

Stephen Baldwin usually seem like a bad actor. i didn't hate his acting in the Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas movie, i just didn't like their story in that movie. As for Bio-Dome, the plot wasn't good. firstly, a bunch of scientists are about to go on a mission where for one year, they lock themselves in this building where they just work on their experiments. Meanwhile, two men (if you want to call them that) are acting like a bunch of weirdos (and not in a good way) play paper, rock, scissors and Pauly Shore wins and acts like an idiot when he wins. to get out of doing something for Earth Day with their really pretty girlfriends, Shore hits Baldwin with a book and makes the girls mad (who see through their excuse).So the girls decide to make them jealous by going off and calling them and telling them they are going to hang out with some guys which of course works (since these two seem to not have brains a lot of the time). they get there and realize that they were tricked, so they go home and (thinking it to be a mall) go into the Bio-Dome as it's being locked. so sure enough, these two are locked in with the scientists for a year. i won't spoil too much more, but basically after they are locked in with the scientists, Shore and Baldwin just act like a bunch of morons while the viewer watches and tries to find out what's funny. honestly, i think i found one funny moment in what's supposed to be (i think) a comedy. i don't recommend anyone to see this movie unless you just like hearing Pauly Shore make really stupid noises (which he does throughout the whole movie).

And I loved it more each time.I can see that people have very different opinions about this movie, which is easy to understand. The kind of humor in this movie requires a special audience .. And I'm just happy to be one of those special people :)I'll just leave it with a 10 in the vote rating, put on the soundtrack that have been sitting in the back of my cd collection for way to long. and go and order it on DVD , to see if it's not still as funny as I remember it to be.",

Well about 10 minutes in, Pauly's girlfriend makes a joke about men that made me chuckle... A couple of the actresses are cute... Actually, credit goes to a couple actors for trying to salvage this film. But nothing can save it. These types of movies rely 99% on the comedy duo. The guys from \"Dude, Where's My Car\" were watchable. The guys in \"Harold and Kumar...\" were watchable. Shore and Baldwin are unwatchable - and so is this movie.",

The movie is about two junior college buddies, Bud and Doyle, who, on Earth Day no less, become trapped in the Bio-Dome, an environmental experimental thing in the middle of Tusan.  Now they are trapped inside for a year and must adapt to being off their couch for more than 5 seconds. \nThis movie is an instant classic, trust me.BEST LINES   Line 1                           DOYLE: Bio Dome.  Does that mean it goes both ways?                               BUD: I don't know, but we do. Line 2                                 BUD: Excuse me, miss.

Pauly Shore wasn't the best choice for this movie. it should have been done by a bunch no-named actors so Pauly wouldn't suck even worse than he already did. Same for the Baldwin that was there too. it's a shame they could have been lawyers or doctors. i'd rather have Pauly Shore operate on me than tell me jokes. what else sucked about this movie was the fact that the premise was HORRIBLE. two stoners trapped in a bubble? i could think of something more interesting after i overdose on opium",

Pauly shore was first on MTV and his personality on this show is how he acts a bit stupid but it still works. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh. if you do enjoy this movie check out son in law kinda on the same wave length as this movie also funny and corny.Kylie Minogue is great in this movie as well and quite funny too. Steven Baldwin in usual suspect is very tense in this extremely entertaining",

By the end of the film I too had come to love our to ecologists for a year. And face it. Anyone who can Whoudinie a back door for a awesome party can't be all bad!Once again I found myself hypnotized by the stunning vision of womanhood that Patricia Hearst casts.

But, again, when it doesn't take itself seriously then this can give mindless laughter.And all in all it was a well done mindless comedy - sure, no Adam Sandler effort, but nonetheless could entertain you for 90 minutes if your into that sort of stuff (if you are not, however, I think you will despise the jokes on offer here). Also it may be of extra entertainment value at seeing some stars of the present day as they were 8 years ago. 6/10.",
