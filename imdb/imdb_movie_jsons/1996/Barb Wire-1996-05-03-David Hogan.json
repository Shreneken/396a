            "content": "Although based in comic book series, the \"Barb Wire\" movie intends to be a remake o classical \"Casablanca\". It keeps the core elements of the 40's film, but adapts it to a distopic sci-fi action futuristic movie. Pamela Anderson plays Barb, a role similar to Bogart's Rick. The gender of the love affair from the past and of the third part of the love triangle have also been changed. The fictional town of Steel Harbor in the United States replaces Casablanca and the story is held during a futuristic Second Civil War rather than in the beginning of World War II. Both protagonists own a bar/nightclub, but Barb Wire is also a bounty huntress. As this remake is a sci-fi film, special contact lenses that cheat retinal scans substitute the letters of transit kept with Rick. As predictable, acting is worse in this remake, which has much more action. Off course \"Casablanca\" is much better, but surprisingly \"Barb Wire\" is not bad, in spite of the bad critics it has received.",

In this film you get her usual qualities in a sufficient amount: Pam is pretty, Pam is sexy and she\u00b4s joking in a self-ironic humor for the whole film. So what do you want more?!? The opening sequence is great and Udo Kier, one of the most culty German actors next to the deceased Klaus Kinski is also in! Of course, if you expect a great film you certainly will be disappointed: the set decoration is pretty cheap and the plot is stolen from \"Casablanca\". Nevertheless \"Barb Wire\" is very entertaining and should be regarded as funny action trash with an attractive main actress - nothing more, nothing less! Just be glad that David Hasselhoff is not in!!! (6/10)",

            "content": "Picture this: a Pamela Anderson science fiction double bill on television. I mean, you'd just HAVE to watch it, wouldn't you? Just to see how bad it was.1995's Naked Souls kept making me look for the \"TV Movie\" credit that wasn't there. A cheap and exploitative \"erotic thriller\" where Pammie exposes her left breast within the first three minutes of the movie. Anderson is an artist, specialising in plaster-casting nude women, rubbing mixture over their breasts while they proclaim \"it feels kinda sexy\". Her boyfriend, decently played by Brian Krause, is studying brain wave patterns and accidentally crosses his own with that of a serial killer. It's all very silly and derivative, also involving a Faustian pact with a mysterious benefactor. What disturbs is that all the victims of the killer are nude women \u0096 I mean, who gets into a swimming pool naked? \u0096 meaning the film uses sexual violence as titillation. Dean Stockwell, in a minor role, is wasted in stuff like this.If Anderson's role in the predictable Naked Souls was peripheral (and also completely irrelevant to the plot), then Barb Wire sees her take over the screen. Released the following year, this saw the now Pamela Anderson Lee as the titular character, a Barbarella of the 90s. Of course she can't act \u0096 she only manages one expression throughout the whole two hours \u0096 but her assured performance is wonderful here. While it's easy to lump both these films together as trash entertainment, Barb Wire is so much more than that. A vibrant, witty and well-directed cartoon for the screen, its constant energy is a delight. What really appeals is in seeing the sheer amount of cinema pastiches the film rigs up. Batman, Never Say Never Again and even The A-Team are all parodied. But most significantly, it shares multiple plot similarities with Casablanca, and I honestly suspect that this was intentional. Or would its 2017 planes really be so old-fashioned? Barb is a neutral bar owner during a war by day (ring a bell?) a vixen for hire by night. The landscape she occupies is an excitingly neon world of legalised prostitution, engineered diseases and sophisticated contact lenses.\nMaybe the opening moments \u0096 Anderson Lee exposing her bare nipples while water washes over them to a baying crowd \u0096 are tacky and unnecessary. The scenes that follow also contain a torture sequence that is not only misguided in its attempt to arouse but also transparent in its purpose for expository dialogue. Yet beyond those first few scenes we have an action movie that contains above-average scripting for the genre, and some fun moments. It's amusing to try and guess whether Pam knew she was being kitsch or whether she genuinely believed she was giving a good performance. But whatever the answer, it still gets a laugh when a rowdy customer finds his genitals in the mouth of her rabid Rottweiler. \"Sit\", she tells the dog, much to the drunk's displeasure. \"Now, you don't want to see her roll over, do you?\"All the criticisms that can be made against this film \u0096 that it's badly acted, appallingly scripted, dumb and sexist (even though none of them are 100% true anyway) \u0096 can be disputed by the fact that it's SUPPOSED to be badly acted, appallingly scripted, dumb and sexist. This is a film that never pretends to be anything other than a pumped-up, camp and downright silly movie. What's more, it succeeds in being more entertaining and convincing than many of the \"straight\" versions of the same format, with particular note drawn to it's fight scenes. They may be excessive and lack maturity, but they're shot beautifully and are fun to watch. I'm not a huge fan of action pictures, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. If you want a film that possesses depth and integrity, then see something else. If you want a lovably stupid movie, with Pamela Anderson sticking out her little finger as she burns rubber on a motorbike, then watch this. Tremendous fun.",

I almost rolled around on the floor laughing at times, due to the sheer stupidity of several scenes. It's so bad that it's good. It's so 'B-movie-like' that you can't possibly take it serious. A lot of people are saying the story is a rip-off of Casablanca. I don't know if that's true, since I haven't seen Casablanca, but I'll take your word for it. I didn't expect it to be an original story. In fact, I didn't expect more of the movie than to see Pamela Anderson naked. That was the primary reason I bought it, no reason to deny that. But the movie was just so entertaining, in every scene there was something so ridiculous that you couldn't help laughing at it. And that's the point. Don't sit down and analyze this movie, save that for intelligent movies. I knew from the very first scene, that this wasn't going to be intelligent, or great, or whatever. But it was fun to watch, and it does have a plot, and scenes that go together to create a meaning, which is more than what could be said about several new movies(Scary movie 2, just to name one). I didn't, for one single scene, find it to be boring, slow or just the least bit intelligent. And that's exactly what it was made to be. Entertainment. Nothing more.As an added bonus, it has some great parodies on Bond and Batman movies. You should definitely watch it, if you're into B movies(normally I'm not, but this was just too good to miss.) 7/10",

I'm not calling Anderson a porno star but lets be honest, she famous for having great breasts right?  So how can we harness this star power?  Lets put her in tight clothes in a futuristic remake of Casablanca!The plot is a sheer rip off and still manages to be poor.  It is only an excuse for tight clothes and silly big explosions.  As a dumb Saturday night special it still barely cuts it for me, although it is noisy, if that's all you want.....Anderson isn't an actress \u0096 if it wasn't for a good publicity agent and a boob-job, she wouldn't even be offered the roles that Shannon Tweed gets! She doesn't convince as an actress as she can't get above the range required by Baywatch \u0096 look scared, look happy, look sad, look determined, oh and poke out your boobs!  The rest of the cast have nothing to do and it's a shame to see reliable bit part players like Howard and Xander Berkley appearing in this.Overall it has some pretty explosions but really this is like a Playboy video \u0096 it's all designed for the purpose of capitalising on Anderson's body.......why should we be surprised that it does nothing else.",

            "content": "To be perfectly honest with you, my appreciation of this movie is almost solely based on Pamela Anderson's breasts. I'm not going to waste your time and claim anything else. Take Pammy out of 'Barb Wire' and you are left with something highly mediocre. The story, action and other characters are simply by-the-numbers and I really cannot be bothered discussing them. It's Pamela's film pure and simple.It wouldn't be over-stating it to say that I thought the opening credit sequence was quite good. Pamela in tight black leather, half out of her top being soaked by a hose? I would say there's four good ideas in there, all in one. Unfortunately, this is where the film peaks and we are only two minutes in. Sadly, a story kicks in at this point and spoils things. But seriously Ms Anderson is perfect for this flick. Her pneumatic figure couldn't be any better for the role she's playing. She is quite ridiculously sexy throughout the entire picture and the film frankly flags when she is not on screen. She is more than serviceable in this action role too. It's worth pointing out here that I am a big Russ Meyer fan and, therefore, it's perhaps no surprise that I have a huge weakness for dangerous, sexy, buxom women. The biggest compliment I can pay Pammy, therefore, is that on this showing she would not have looked out of place as one of the lead bad girls in 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' High praise but quite frankly true.The only criticism I can level at Pamela here is she doesn't get naked enough.",

            "content": "There are some films that are bad, infamous bad and Barb Wire is one of those I have heard about. Some bad films are trashy but can be a bit fun, like Showgirls and some can just be wrong like Striptease. Barb Wire is a film I guess in some way I'm kind of undecided on, it has the making for just a bad movie with Pamela's bad acting but has the action scenes and cheesy lines that make it fun as well. This movie is a retelling of Cassablanca and isn't so quick to hide that fact, so I guess this is the exotic remake. Pam Anderson is a sexy female lead and isn't that hard to believe that at times she can be tough, she does wear that leather well I have to admit, but some of the way she delivers the lines was a little too Shaquil O'Neil, I think if you're going to do a movie like this, you might as well go over the top, go a little James Woods, it's all good. But we need a fun action film with the lead being female, just sad that this is a bad film that got overlooked. Set in 2017 during the \"Second American Civil War\", Barb Wire owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in Steel Harbor \"the last free city\" in a United States ravaged by the civil war and she brings in extra cash by hiring out as a mercenary and bounty hunter. Her club is raided by Chief of Police Willis, who is looking for the fugitive Dr. Corrina \"Cora\" Devonshire. Devonshire, a former government scientist, has information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior, Colonel Pryzer of the Congressional Directorate; she is trying to escape to Canada in order to make this information public. Meanwhile, Devonshire has turned up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood, a \"freedom fighter\" whom Barb had known at the outbreak of the war, but the two were separated soon afterward. Axel is now married to Cora, and is trying to help her get to Canada. They are trying to find a contraband pair of contact lenses which will allow Cora to evade the retinal scan at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.Barb Wire really wasn't as bad as I was expecting, even though it's just a remake of a classic romantic movie, it does have some cool moments. I loved some of the action scenes, the fight on the fork lift was a lot of fun to watch and since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, it's all good and makes the fight scenes that more exciting. I guess I could say that I enjoyed the movie a little bit, I suppose it's a new guilty pleasure. Pam Anderson may be an awful actress, but it's not like I was looking for an Oscar worth movie when I decided to watch it. But I have a feeling that the director has some serious sexual issues considering some of the strange erotic torture devices used in the film are a bit much, maybe I don't want to know. If you have an open mind and are looking for a good bad film, I think you'll get a kick out Barb Wire. However just think if you're looking for an actual action film with good acting, just look at the cover, enough said.5/10",

Pamela has cascading blonde hair down to there, acres of cleavage and plenty of clingy leather getups cut up to here. If you get distracted and call Ms. Wire the dreaded \"B\" word, you may find yourself dealing with her nasty-tempered Rottweiler, Camille, a sidekick with bite. This highly anticipated comic-book action/adventure, starring the pinup star of Baywatch, lasted only a short time in theaters before going bust, so to speak. I'm sure the backers couldn't care less, as their investment was made back in advance by tremendous worldwide sales. Barb Wire was sold on the star's face and form long before there was a story concept or anything resembling a script. Good thing, too. Yes, the futuristic plot does bear some parallels to Casablanca, but the family resemblance is strictly skin-deep. Barb is a nightclub owner who helps an old flame, now a freedom fighter, and his wife escape from a corrupt police official and some neo-Nazi types. Of all the gin joints in the world, Axel had to walk into Barb's. Barb has just been hosed down while performing a torrid dance onstage and is feeling, well, charitable. The movie gets off to a pretty good start, with tongue well in cheek, but grows wearisome when it forgets to laugh at itself. The explosions, shoot-outs and chases are eventually numbing. Must say, however, I did love the death-by-spike-heel scene which comes early on. Steve Railsback, as the head meanie, Colonel Pryzer, comes across as Tommy Lee Jones-lite. Ms. Anderson Lee, as Barb the Buxom, is game, however, firing oversized weapons and kicking fanny without mussing her makeup. Too bad they couldn't afford some better wigs for her stunt doubles.",

Clearly, there is no relevant story in the movie, all revolves around (Barb) to show her off in different ways. The mentioned costumes are almost offending to the audience. Whoever responsible for them clearly did not work very hard. Barb competes with herself to wear some leather-thing that shows off as much as possible, but actually must be considered well dressed as compared to other ladies. The villains wear something that bear a striking resemblance to nazi-uniforms. Well sure, we know who's the bad guys, thank you. And some other people wear broken calculators and other piece of machinery that you'll find in a scrap-heap as hats, and are automatically dressed up like guys from the future.

This was her naked sci/fi Hollywood film, the opening of the movie shows her stripping, showing her breasts and getting hit with water. Ooooh, so sexy. This was probably the one scene many kids watched over and over. The film itself is regarded as one of those, it's so bad it's good. I can totally see that and once I got pass Anderson's wooden acting, I actually enjoyed myself. Guilty as charged.I said I would have loved this when it first came out. I say that because I was around 10 years old and a film like this, that is drenched in so called \"sexiness\" would have been imprinted on my mind. Seeing it for the first time in full when I'm 22, went to film school and have been on the internet since I was whatever age, the film doesn't strike me as sexy. Anderson does look good though and seeing her prance around in tight leather doesn't hurt either. Much better than what Halle Berry tried to do with Catwoman. Anderson became famous for her breasts and that was the focus of the film. Every other shot is of her massive cleavage. Am I complaining? Not really. But we have porno for that, the catch is that Anderson is someone \"somewhat\" famous. There is a special feature on the DVD called SEXY OUTTAKES. This is ten minutes long and it is of her stripping with the water. Basically the entire opening, but for ten minutes. Jango Fett from the Star Wars prequels is in this film, I found myself saying \"Hey it's that guy\" a lot every time a character came on screen. The film is campy, what else do I need to say? The acting is campy, the script is god-awful and taken from Casablanca, the nudity isn't even that good. I expected more, the film feels like a tease. Barb Wire is like Showgirls. Made to appeal to the perverted crowd, only this one has explosions. I'm giving this one a high rating, for it's campiness feel. It's trash, but golden trash.",

Again....none of these characters or films were ever intended to be carried by the Criterion Collection nor to be up for Academy Awards!In this story, Anderson plays the title character, a combination stripper, hooker and assassin. And it's all set in a dystopian and dark world...of the USA in 2017! She strips, turns tricks and leaves bodies where ever she goes! She also, interestingly, sounds like she's doing a Steven Segal impersonation in the film...softly mumbling most of her lines. Bad enough for a Razzie?

It delivers this....along with a dark, silly and not especially enjoyable story.If you actually JUST want to see Ms. Anderson's body, skip to the special features on the disc and select 'SEXY OUTTAKES'....then you can skip the silly movie entirely and just see what most folks who watch the DVD really want anyway.By the way, the opening song was \"Word Up\"....an extremely catchy R&B/hiphop song by Cameo.

Still, it's difficult not to like Pam Anderson's role, if only because of her being sexy. There is a touch of humor in her campy portrayal. It's not spectacular acting, but it's fun. Pamela also resembles the comic book Barb to an uncanny degree, and the supporting cast is wonderfully cartoony. The story isn't well written, but it gives the cute one liners (\"Don't... call me babe\"), and action sequences, which are all fun to watch. I realize that it isn't high art, but this movie just has a level of silliness and seriousness that's hard not to like. The music, story, and dialogue all give the movie its cheesiness, and in some way, it's made to be entertaining.Pam is extremely sexy in this movie, and great to watch. She has a scowl all the time, and is dressed to kill in low cut, tight outfits. Sadly, we don't get that much nudity (which alone could have carried the movie). The scenes where there is some, it's pretty clear, and we get a good look at Pamela's incredible body, and the atmosphere and her poses are always very sexy. But there isn't enough of this. It's a fun blend of action, silly dialogue, nudity, and... well Pamela Anderson. Go rent it. It's not a great movie, but it's not a terrible one, and one that's a heck of a good time. NOTE: I suggest the unrated version. It contains more nudity (there isn't that much to begin with) and a ten minutes of footage at the end with Pamela nude in a bathtub, which is really great.",

            "content": "What's the matter? People don't have a sense of humorous camp anymore? I don't understand why \"Barb Wire\" is generally regarded as one of the world's worst movies ever made, whereas it's honestly not any worse than the vast majority of cheesy and violent post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi flicks from the late 70's/early 80's. Well, perhaps it's slightly worse than those, but at least the defects are widely compensated by the totally unpretentious atmosphere and the light-headed approach of everyone involved in the production, including Pam Anderson herself. Nobody who cooperated on \"Barb Wire\" seemed to take the film overly serious, so why should we? In fact, the concept is even quite unique and courageous! Who would ever dare to do a futuristic remake of \"Casablanca\" and replace the talented Humphrey Bogart with a busty blond bimbo, the cherubic Ingrid Bergman with a beefcake Maori rebel warrior and the legendary Rick's Caf\u00e9 with a sleazy bar called The Hammerhead? It's a trashy, campy, sleazy, grotesque and incredibly flamboyant Sci-Fi story timed in the year 2017, in a society spoiled by the Second Civil War and a city dominated by mayhem, corruption and resistance. Barb Wire owns the successful bar, but makes even more money with her side jobs as rough bounty hunter and hired assassin. She leads a good life until her former resistance-lover shows up with a fugitive scientist who needs a special pair of contact lenses in order to flee to Canada. Barb always remained neutral in political matters (following her example Rick in \"Casablanca\"), but it looks as if she'll have to get involved now. \"Barb Wire\" may be bad, but at the same time it's fantastically entertaining, with horrible dialogs and one-liners (\"Don't call me babe!\"), hideous wasteland sets, explosive action sequences and extravagant costume designs. Mrs. Anderson herself continuously exhibits revealing leather outfits and sexy stilettos while her opponents the Congressionals harness Nazi-like uniforms. The relatively unknown director David Hogan even managed to gather an impressive selection of B-actors to fill up his supportive cast, like Steve Railsbeck, Xander Berkeley, Clint Howard and even Udo Kier. So, seriously, what's the problem here? \"Barb Wire\" surely isn't as worthless as it looks or everyone claims it is. Try to interpret it as a throwback to traditional post-apocalyptic cinema mixed with excessively violent modern day comic book adaptations and you'll definitely find some enjoyment.",

            "content": "Set in 2017, at the time of making still twenty one years into the future, takes place after the United States has been ravaged by a second civil war. A fascist regime has taken over with only one city remaining free. Here there is little in the way of law and order. Bounty hunter Barb Wire, takes on various jobs when she isn't busy running her club, The Hammerhead. One day her former lover and his new wife turn up; she has evidence, and a cure, to the regime's war crimes but can't get it to Canada. To get there she must acquire a special pair of contact lenses that will enable her to pass the retinal scanners... will they be able to persuade Barb to take a side for once and get her out?From the opening scene it becomes clear that this is going to be trashy and clich\u00e9 riddled. The dystopian aesthetic is typical of the era... I'm sure when society collapses people will were clothes that border of fetish gear. Similarly the landscape is typical with lots of dilapidated industrial sites being used. If the plot seems familiar it is because it has been taken straight from 'Casablanca'... strangely the moment I realised this I suddenly found myself enjoying it far more. The acting isn't great but I don't think anybody was in this film for the awards, unless they were hoping for a Razzie. Honourable exceptions for Xander Berkeley as the city's chief of police and Udo Kier as \"Curly\", the head waiter at The Hammerhead. There is plenty of action; lots of shooting and explosions but nothing gory to speak of. Mrs Anderson Lee's costume may be very revealing but there was surprisingly little nudity and I didn't notice any strong language so there isn't too much to offend; I was a little surprised it was enough to earn a UK-18 certificate. Overall I'd say this was good trashy fun; just don't expect greatness and you should have a good time.",

Actors who act like they own the place, a plot that holds together, explosions, fight scenes, and if you can get some sexy stuff, then that's a plus. This movie has all of this.People say Pam doesn't act well in this? Do the same people give good grades to films with Steven Seagal or J. C. V. D? Let's be honest, I love Stalone and Schwarzennger, but we can't say Schwarzzy acts better in Terminator, Conan, or most of his movies.The only reason why people criticized this film, and Pam's acting, is PURE SEXISM. People are willing to accept that Rambo can take on half the soviet army with only a bow and a handful of grenades in the afghan desert, but people aren't willing to accept that a gorgeous big breasted blonde would be able to tear them a new one, ride a motor cycle while shooting down 50 guys, and screw over the whole legal and criminal establishment.I think this is the only reason why this movie has such a bad mark on here, and why it was so badly received. Pure sexism. In 1996, people were not willing to accept a woman as an action movie star.By all means, I found it more fun to watch than Predator. Half of predator was just watching big muscle men crawling in the jungle, acting all tough. Here you have stuff happening. Could there have been more gunfights? Hell yes. Could there have been more Pam kicking ass? By all means yes - you can't have enough Pam kicking ass. Does the ending get to be a bit clich\u00e9? Yes.I liked this movie more than the average action film, not just because I think Barb Wire is a great character, and Pam does her super well. I liked that this movie had ambiance. Filthy streets, crummy buildings; something between sci-fi and Film noir. Ambiance is very important for me when I watch a movie, and this one has it. Finally, YES, I did enjoy all the crude nudity, sexy lingerie, and so one - though I enjoyed all this while the movie set badass empowering female characters.I think there is still time to make a series of these - I would gladly watch the next ones in the movie theatres.",

Bounty hunter & occasional gun for hire leather clad babe Barb Wire (Pamela Anderson) runs a nightclub called the Hammerhead & generally gets on the best she can, Barb decides to capture bail jumper William Krebs (Loren Rubin) & hand him over for the reward. At first all goes well & Barb ends up with $20,000, however it turns out that Krebs was a wanted man. Wanted by both the freedom fighting resistance because of a pair of contact lenses he had & wanted by the evil congressional directorate because of, well, a pair of contact lenses. These lenses are important as they let the wearer pass through any retina scanner & defected congressional scientist Dr. Corrina Devonshire (Victoria Rowell) needs them to board a plane to Canada so she can warn the world about a virus which the congressional are planning on using to wipe out all resistance to them... Barb is caught right in the middle & has to choose a side to work for.Directed by David Hogan this sci-fi action adventure film was based a Dark Horse comic series of the same name & is a universally trashed film for reasons I personally can't quite figure out although people generally rubbish Pamela Anderson rather than the film itself which leads me to believe most have made their minds up before they see it or are just a tiny bit jealous. Before I go any further I have to say right now that Barb Wire has the best opening credit sequence of any film I've ever seen, period. The hot looking Pamela Anderson in a tight fitting leather dress dancing & being sprayed with water while exposing her breasts is just plain classy film-making. Anyway, the script by Chuck Pfarrer & Ilene Chaiken which could be described as a futuristic remake of Casablanca (1942) isn't anything I didn't expect from it, it's noisy, it has some violent action scenes, a few explosions, simplistic dialogue, a disturbing view of the future run by a Nazi uniform clad government & very one dimensional character's so what's the problem? Did Barb Wire ever promise it was going to be anything other than a futuristic sci-fi? Was it ever intended to be anything other than a fun B-Movie? Personally I think it delivers on some of it's potential but is missing something, the action scenes seem a little light & short, the first 30 odd minutes are great fast paced comic book action but it then loses it's way, some of the character's are just too lightweight & the mix of camp & seriousness isn't quite right. For all it's faults & it has some I liked it, there are bits & pieces here which I enjoyed a lot. It's a situation where I feel the sum of it's parts is less than what it should be.I think a lot of the blame for Barb Wire has to go to director David Hogan, this was his first film after making a couple of music videos & it shows. The character's aren't fleshed out enough, the film is uneven, the action scenes could have been brilliant in a capable director's hands but Hogan is more interested in placing the camera at cool angles & forgets about putting on a spectacle for the audience. Apart from the gunfight between Barb & two cops & a fight on top of a crane the action scenes are not exciting, far too forgettable & way too short. A stronger more experienced director might have ironed these problems out & Barb Wire could have been a great piece of sci-fi action, I still like it but feel it's flawed. A special mention goes to Pamela Anderson who looks fantastic in this wearing a selection of fetishistic clothing, the long leather coat, the tight corset & thigh high boots she wears while catching Kreps is just god damned cool & sexy! Barb Wire is a frustrating film for me because there are things I like about it so much but other things which I hate, Pamela Anderson & her leather outfits is one thing that I love though.Technically the film is aright, the daytime scenes all seem to have an orange sepia tone to them while the night scenes are very blue. The film has reasonable production values & a 40's period feel to the production design although the main locations seem to be a couple of old warehouses. There's actually not a bad cast here, Xander Berkeley, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Victoria Rowell (I just couldn't stop thinking about Diagnosis Murder!), & Steve Railsback isn't a bad selection of actors at all. Pamela Anderson isn't great but she's alright & looks the business although Tamuera Morrison is truly awful in every scene he's in.Barb Wire could have been great, I think an inexperienced director who hadn't directed a sci-fi or action film before hurt the film in the end. I'm by no means saying Barb Wire is any sort of classic but there are moments here that I really liked, Pamela Anderson just looks great in leather & it has the best opening credit sequence ever, I can't recommend it but it's a film I'll always stick up for when everyone else is trashing it.",

However, when a former government scientist named \"Dr. Corina Devonshire\" (Victoria Rowell) escapes from the Congressional Directoret and arrives in Steel Harbor carrying some special contact lenses worth $2 million-along with Barb Wire's former lover named \"Axel Hood\" (Temuera Morrison)-Barb Wire becomes indirectly involved. And that spells bad news for whichever side she's not on. Anyway, rather than reveal the rest of the details and possibly spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie was widely panned by the critics when it first came out. As a matter of fact, Pamela Anderson received several Razzie Awards for her performance which included \"Worst New Star\" and \"Worst Actress\". Other Razzie Awards for the film included \"Worst Picture\" along with being nominated for \"Worst Screenplay\" and \"Worst Original Song\". So judging from these awards and nominations one would think that this was an extremely bad movie. However, rather than simply going with the proverbial crowd I happen to have my own opinion which is quite different. First, I didn't think her performance was that bad. As a matter of fact I kind of enjoyed it. Not only that but I have seen a lot worse movies than this particular one. Now, that's not to say that this film was great by any means because it clearly wasn't. But it was hardly the worst movie for that year. Nowhere close. Likewise, although I didn't especially care for the performance of Temuera Morrison I thought the performance of Udo Kier (as \"Curly\") was actually quite good. Anyway, there you have it. Again, while \"Barb Wire\" may not be a great film I didn't think it was necessarily that bad either. I rate it as average.",

She's not that sexy to spend 98 minutes watching a movie, loosely based on the movie plot of 1942's Casablanca. I wouldn't say this movie paying homage to it, as a lot of it was change, so it wouldn't be a total rip off of Casablanca. Barb Wire, the film is mostly based on the Dark Horse comics that bare its name. Barb Wire, the comic book wasn't that popular, and the film follows that. Barb Wire isn't that sharp, but it's does hurts to watch. Set in 2017 during the Second American Civil War, Barb Wire (Pamela Anderson) owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in Steel Harbor. Steel Harbor is describe as the last free city in a United States that wasn't ravaged by the war. In my opinion, it was ravaged by a horrible script. Directed by David Hogan, everything looks dirty. Steel Harbor looks like a dump, and Hammerhead is like a hole in the wall strip club. There isn't no glamor here. I think the film makers were going the gritty Sci-Fi route with this story, but there is no class, when you make a movie that has your main character parading herself in her bathing suit. It's not a believable to believe this half naked woman is a bad ass mercenary and bounty hunter. Like the Casablanca movie, a Chief of Police comes around time to time to raid her club for fugitives. Willis (Xander Berkeley) is looking for fugitive Dr. Corrina \"Cora D\" Devonshire (Victoria Rowell), a former government scientist with information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior, Colonel Pryzer (Steve Railsback) of the Congressional Directorate. Cora D later turns up at the club, with Axel Hood (Temuera Morrison) a freedom fighter from the United Front whom Barb had known and loved before the war. Both hopes to escape to Canada in order to make this information public. If you're looking for Casablanca like performance, here. You're deeply going to be disappointed. The characters in this movie are pretty unlikeable as Barb only cares about money. Barb doesn't go through any struggle with morality. The acting is bad. Pamela Anderson speaks in this movie with little to no emotion in her delivery. It's not like the dialogue is any good. Most of it was bland. Monologues are horrible. Show, don't tell, movie. The only reason why this movie was made was to capitalize on how hot and popular, Pamela Anderson was in the 1990s. The movie was made for the objectification of women. The opening shot of the movie, has a stripping, dancing wet Barb (Pamela Anderson) as a way to introduce this character. I thought I was watching a porno, then an action movie when I saw this. It tries to be feminist in a way, because Barb Wire hates being call 'babe', but fails miserably due to pointless nudity scenes, blatant sexual overtones and fantasies of torture to women. Plus, they even said Barb is also a hooker. This movie is disturbing. The action is pretty bad. The stunts are painfully unspectacular. She did some of her own stunts, although the corset and the heels she wore made fight scenes very challenging. I don't find how Barb Wire is able to fight off enemies wearing black leather and 7 inch high heeled boots. I would thought she would fall, a few times. Watching the outtakes, she did. The vision of a fascist America, is never that canny. In my opinion, if the story went deeper into how this world came to be, maybe this film could had work. The camera work is horrible. The obnoxious close-ups and the endless fade to black get tiresome. Yes, the movie does have some entertaining value as its target audience might like seeing Pamela's boobs and violent mixed together. Still, in the end, anybody that watch this, knows well that this is a bad movie. It was cheesy when it came out, and it's still cheesy. Don't expect this movie to be what it isn't. It's a B movie, with B everything. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. Still, this movie sucks.",

            "content": "21st century. USA. The second civil war. The whole country is in a state of emergency. What was formerly called the American Congress now rules with fascistic methods. There is only one free city left, Steel Harbor, headquarter for the resistance. This is the hometown of Barb Wire, owner of the night club Hammerhead. As times aren't good, Barb has a second job. She's a bounty hunter and you probably wouldn't want her after you. Barb's credo is to never take sides for anybody and that's the only way to survive these days. As her former lover Axel Hood appears asking for a favor, Barb suddenly finds herself to be key player on high political stage. Now she has to take sides.I really didn't want to watch this film. I thought it would be all sex and nudity but I gave it a try and I was surprised. I actually liked it! First, without the bashing, let me give you some reasons: Barb Wire is a unique, kick ass character. I loved her! The one liners are extremely cheesy that it makes you smile. And this picture has a lot of work put into it like any other great film ever made.I like the whole look of the film. It's (obviously) exotic for the hormone raging male teenagers to love and the apocalyptic look is very good and realistic. You got to give these guys some credit. The action sequences were surprisingly decent, although there aren't many in this film as I thought there will be.The character Pamela Anderson makes out is fantastic, but at the same time, it's kind of dull. Temuera Morrison gives a good performance as well as Victoria Rowell. I like that the last 15 minutes of the film has non-stop action. I love the explosions and fighting sequences.Maybe the reason I like the film is that this film knows it is being bad, but it has a fun time with it. Yes, there are gaping plot holes and it's preposterous but it doesn't matter. I really didn't care.Of course, this isn't going to be a very good film but it isn't a bad one either. It's surprisingly satisfying and the lines are cheesy that it puts a smile to your face. If you would like to watch a film with some good action sequences and a lot of exotic scenes (including nudity), you'll like this film. Even hormone-raging male teens will like this.",

What did they come up with? Apparently, not so much the comic book story (from what I've heard the comic book is about, which isn't much), but, well... Casablanca? Yes, Casablanca, at least to a great degree. It's hard not to see one of the most 'what-the-huh?' combinations of low-art with high-art since Strange Brew's story came right out of Hamlet. There's even Clint Howard as Peter Lorre and some character named \"Fatso\" who plays Sidney Greenstreet! One things for sure, folks, Pam Anderson is NO Humphrey Bogart (we all know who's were real and spectacular after all).But I digress, this is a pretty stupid movie, made on the cheap all at the expense of men everywhere who can't get enough of the overly stacked blonde bubble of hot that is Pam Anderson (Lee at the time), who is pretty much either naked (and when so either in an overlong dance sequence in partial nudity, or wrapped conviniently in bubbles, or in leather, more so the latter) and spouts poorly written dialog like a pro. This is probably both a compliment and an insult; only someone like Anderson, who is some nice, Heavy Metal style eye candy but not that much of an actress, could pull off this script like she does, which features special contact lenses as the MacGuffin and a transport of some girl across the lines of some Nazi outback law enforcement agency out to hunt her like dogs. Did I mention there are explosions and stuff? They're cool, I guess... Not much else here, folks, unless you're Beavis and Butt-head.

And the rest of the acting ranges to pretty poor to non-existent. The action sequences are in a way efficiently performed but choreographed in a generic way and some of the editing feels sloppy. I liked how catchy and how upbeat the soundtrack was but it got a bit too loud and too much after a while, the script is cheesy and weak and the story is so thin you have to watch closely to see if there is a story, and I have no better news about the direction.

            "content": "Thus far in mainstream comic book related movies, only one female antihero has turned out having very little complaints and that's Black Widow from Marvel's The Avengers (2012). Then again, she also has not had any solo film but she has appeared in several films prior and so far, there really hasn't been an uproar over Scarlett Johansson's portrayal as the deadly assassin. Beyond this character however, movie studios have not been able to pinpoint the proper approach to making a worthy female heroine film. There have been several attempts, but so far none have proved to be lucrative. For Dark Horse Entertainment, which was no stranger to their comic books being adapted to film took more than one wack at making a feminine hero focused film. The year before, they also helped surface British Comic, Tank Girl (1995), which also flopped. Then came this, which by many consider being one of the worst comic book films. As an overall film, it's not even near decent but it isn't the worst.The setting takes place in 2018 where (like many other futures are described) the next all out war broke out. This time being called the \"second civil war\"; there's only one place among the whole land where people can live free without the strong eye of government looking over them. However even there, no one is safe. After learning a deadly secret, Dr. Cora (Victoria Rowell) and her husband Axel (Temuera Morrison) attempt to flee the country to Canada but are met with endless setbacks. It is at this point they look to find the only person who can help them escape, a local bar owner / bounty hunter known as Barb Wire (Pamela Anderson). As a story, not all of it is passe but a good portion of it is overused elements seen from multiple other films about dystopic futures. Plus cutting it off close to 2020 shot itself in the foot looking at it now. The writing for this screenplay was carried by Chuck Pfarrer (Darkman (1990) & Hard Target (1993)) and Ilene Chaiken (as her first work) did take care of properly giving the main characters' their back story but there are other parts that don't work.A subtle flaw is quick changes in character motivations. At one time in the film a character will have a certain opinion. Then, later on in the film they will declare the opposite opinion with no reasoning. That's a bit frustrating when trying to understand a character. Another matter of contention is convenient contrivances. If something is out of reach for an individual and then later on it is revealed to the viewers that they acquired it (again, with no reason how), it gets frustrating. Almost like the film is saying, \"they're just that good, no sense in showing how they did it\". The last poorly written component to this film is main villain Colonel Pryzer (Steve Railsback). Besides just being callous to everyone he meets, Pryzer is a very generic antagonist dressed in Nazi garb. It's nothing to point out or even worth remembering about because his character is so two dimensional. Surprisingly, the rest of the cast in some ways makes up for it. Local law enforcement Alexander Willis (Xander Berkeley) tries to add some humor to the situation as well as Charlie (Jack Noseworthy).There's also guest appearances from character actors Andre Rosey Brown (as a more eccentric villain than Pryzer), Nicholas Worth, Clint Howard, Udo Kier and Nils Allen Stewart. The relationship between Axel, Dr. Cora and Barb Wire isn't the most believable but it isn't unlikable either. Actually, although Pamela Anderson speaks many of her lines in monotone, some of her quips are funny to hear. When she curses though, the viewer will be able to tell she's not acting material. Then again, if there's one thing Anderson nails, it's her figure of Barb Wire. Of all obvious reasons to pick her, what else? Of course, another curvaceous female could've been cast but let's deal with what's here. Plus, they got the costume down pat and it sure looks good on Anderson. Surprisingly Anderson can even handle the action sequences quite well. Yes, the fact that she also had stunt doubles is understandable but not truly noticeable which is required because viewers should not be able to tell.Cinematography was shot by Rick Bota for this movie. Most of the time the camera-work is acceptable for the action scenes and dialog. The only areas where it fails to feel compelling in the story is in its tracking shots. This was specifically evident either when it was filmed in the bar that Barb Wire owned or outside in garbage dump like settings. Since the story takes place in a chaotic dystopic future, the use of dusty, beige colored, and dune infested backdrops is the ultimate clich\u00e9 for this setting. At least try to make it look different than what's been normally used. It's just been seen too many times. Lastly the musical score was arranged by French composer Michel Colombier. For this round, his composition sounds a bit like Gary Chang's score from Death Warrant (1990) using occasional steel drums. However, a lot of his music is absent and is replaced by hard rock which I guess is appropriate but the sound gets very cluttered because of it and that doesn't help.Many people say it's one of the worst comic books put to film. It certainly doesn't have the most competent of storytelling (which includes the contrivances & clich\u00e9s) and not every character stands out like they should. Pamela Anderson also isn't acting material but she actually gives the viewing a \"so bad it's good\" experience. The action does entertain and some of the other supporting cast members do help make it at least average.",

            "content": "I didn't exactly have high expectations. I recall well when 'Barb Wire' was first released, and it gave the impression of being little more than somewhat exploitative schlock capitalizing on Pamela Anderson's body. The reputation it seems to have earned rather affirms that impression. Apart from a couple unexpected names in the cast (Udo Kier, Clint Howard), no one especially stuck out as a possible savior. Why, this remains the only feature film of director David Hogan, whose work otherwise seems to strictly have been in music videos. On the other hand, screenwriter Chuck Pfarrer is a familiar and welcome name; he's been behind a few quite excellent features. Now that I've watched this rather infamous slice of cinema for myself, color me surprised - I wouldn't go so far as to say it's good, but it's not all bad, honestly.While the presentation is very much a sci-fi action flick, the narrative, its characters, and even some of the less ham-handed dialogue in no small part reflect a neo-noir. I could almost imagine the bare bones of the screenplay serving a different kind of story, were it conceived 40-50 years earlier. To be sure, there are a lot of indelicacies in the writing - and many more in Hogan's direction, which in its own dire inelegance accentuates the problems with Pfarrer's contribution. Yet for all the garish gawkiness that pervades the feature, 'Barb Wire' is penned fairly deftly. Scenes are written well, and though I'm no fan of Hogan's eye as a director, nor his guiding hand, the same scenes are broadly ably executed, too. The narrative, characters, and dialogue, already mentioned as a relative anachronism by film industry standards, are stronger than I possibly could have expected. Far from perfect, of course, but my assumptions were \"rock bottom,\" so every little bit counts for something.The marketing, costume design, and introduction of Anderson's title character portend a notably sleazy genre romp, so I was almost taken aback by how little the actress' physique is actually emphasized in the feature. It's refreshing, frankly: This isn't so much a \"look at the scantily-clad lady!\" action flick, as it is an action flick that just happens to star a woman famed for her stature. Her acting is another question, though. Whether it's from lack of ability, a series of bad days on set, or just the tawdry guiding hand of Hogan, there are few instances herein where her delivery and comportment is convincing. Or is it just that the character of Barb Wire is supposed to be calm, cool and collected? If so, that's definitely not how it came across. Other performances in the film similarly struggle with authenticity, though I think for the most part the supporting cast comes out looking better than Anderson does.There's no mistaking that 'Barb Wire' is also distinctly over the top, probably too much so for its own good. Yet to my amazement, the biggest problem here isn't bombastic action, ham-handed dialogue or acting, or generally poor film-making - but just a lack of a meaningfully distinguishing element. Yes, all the other issues further weigh it down, but the movie above all just possesses nothing to really set it apart, or make it an essential experience. It's not bad, but when you can watch other action pictures with fewer weaknesses, there's no particular reason to seek this one out, save perhaps for curiosity. Oddly, given the low regard for the title at large, to simply call it unremarkable nearly feels like a compliment.Though not exactly riveting, I'm glad I sat to watch this - why not, after all? In the very least, I don't totally regret it, which alone says much. I can't really imagine recommending this, and to sit for it should likely only ever be a question of inquisitiveness, not active interest. Yet the fact remains that I plainly don't think 'Barb Wire' is half as awful as its reception would suggest. It's not specifically deserving of your time, but if you enjoy action movies, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.",

We have Udo Kier and Steven Railsback in it, for those into horror or exploitation those names are famous. And when I saw the name Rick Bota then I immediately must think of him being directing 3 Hellraisers. The story itself is post-apocalyptic so with those actors and the story we could add it into the grindhouse genre even as it wasn't attempt to be.Naturally the main lead was by Pamela Anderson Lee. Back then she was very hot on all aspects. Just made some nudity shots and a porn flick with her husband and of course Baywatch did the producers add her on the wanted list. But face it, she only in it as a teaser. Every time you see her, the most important things are her fake two penny worth breasts. I even has seen the unrated version and indeed, she goes naked now and then only showing tits and nipples.Did I enjoy it? Just looking towards the story and the actors and the gratuitous nudity I liked it and if it would have been made 20 years earlier or even nowadays (remember Bitch Slap also just made for the boys to watch girlies shooting around and posing) it could have been a bigger success.

Who cares? Look at those CANS! We're not here to see her act. We're here to see her Act.Dishonesty reigns supreme as the film touts as its draw-cards the non-stop action and dazzling effects and exciting thrills, and even the fact that Pamela Anderson-Lee is in the lead role, mini-skirting the truth that the only sane reason any human would invest eight dollars and two hours breathing time with this deformed ape-child of a film is to slake their wonder on those Parton-proportioned curios.Not that these pimping pierogies were much of an attraction in the final theatrical release of this film - all one seems to be doing is rubbernecking down impossibly-skewed necklines and incredibly tantalizing side-breast-arc with no real reward for all one's efforts. When the movie ends and no one in the audience has nocturnally emissioned, we realize it has all been just One Big Tease; the only satisfaction coming from racing home and spinning your sixteenth-generation VHS porn. Or once again succumbing to the trailer park v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of *Pam & Tommy: Hardcore and Uncensored* (retching optional).Note to MPAA, fundamentalists, Jesus freaks and evangelists (I could have umbrella'd everyone under \"hypocrites,\" but then we'd have the nitpickers whining, \"Yes, but what *type* of hypocrite am I?\"): *Barb Wire*'s spit-fawning promise of ecstasy, more than any true skin-flick, serves to perpetuate your misguided perception of 'porn creating anti-social behavior'. It is when people are shown the Promised Land and denied it that they resort to forcefully attaining what they have been inhumanely coerced into coveting.Make no mistake: this is porn of the most dangerous caliber.Written by Chris Warner, Ilene Chaiken and Chuck Pfarrer (lifted loosely from the Dark Horse comic heroine of the same name), and directed by music video novice, David Hogan (who should at least be allowed sitting space on the bottom steps of Movie Heaven on effort alone), this film serves as prime fodder as to why this society has such skewed priorities.Purely on the strength of her exhibitionist penchant and her prominent honkers, Anderson-Lee has had the opportunity to become a well-rounded person in more than one sense of the word: in prep for her violent, protruberant role, Anderson-Lee was given kick-boxing lessons, experience with different weaponry, bike-riding experience, not to mention aesthetic pandering, custom-made clothing, voice coaching, acting lessons, manicures, pedicures (and then came the actual salary over and above the personal enhancement) - simply because she cooperates in the exploitation of her judiciously exposed mammii. For the sake of those two perverse, cave-woman infant feed-bags, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on this undeserving tramp with a voice akin to scraping fingernails across a blackboard; every pandering, sycophanting, leather boot-licking courtesy was extended this bubble-headed boob tube with the intelligence quotient of an average chimp - for one eternal glimpse of a circle of wrinkled skin tipping an out-sized silicone implant.Temuera Morrison, of the jaw-dropping New Zealand powerhouse indie film, *Once Were Warriors* finds himself at the opposite end of the talent, intelligence and acting spectrum here. Dependable B-Men, Udo Kier and Clint Howard attempt, with Morrison, to elevate the enterprise with their presence, but I don't think anyone took this as seriously as Ms. Anderson-Lee's chest.Political satirist Bill Maher commented on the opening week's box-office for Barb Wire being less than hefty, and added, \"This proves one thing - America is gay.\"",

There's a real production effort to give coherence to it all the more it's not a blockbuster and it's indeed an anticipation movie ! There's a story, defined characters and a look ! I can even add a soundtrack as the songs are punchy, especially the Shampoo ones ! Pam does her job, not an unforgettable one but not a ridiculous either ! In comparison, i could name a lot of Hollywood scared cows who are always praised notwithstanding they are awful and unfit to act (Jolie, Bellucci, Kidman \u0085). I think that the problem of that movie is it's dark, violent whereas Pam is light and softness alive ! She made it with family shows (\u00ab Baywatch \u00bb, \u00ab home improvement \u00bb) because they reverberate her kind personality ! Sure to balance it, she is attracted to darkness (rockers, violence) but her audience doesn't want her to fall in that pit ! More generally, it's true that this trend to put bad attitude and guns in women is dumb : I agree that women wants equality with men but this doesn't imply that they should be Rambo or Terminator \u0085.",

She plays the titular character in what is apparently a loose remake of CASABLANCA, set in the future and with the main character an assassin facing off against an evil fascist regime. I'd not got around to watching this film for obvious reasons. Even as a teenage boy I didn't like Anderson, finding everything about her fake. Her non-acting in this film is really excruciating and I fully believe that had a proper actress been cast in the lead role this might have been a decent little B-movie. Heck, even Angelina Jolie circa CYBORG 2 might have been up to the job.What's surprising about this film is that the director's actually pretty good, which from a former music video director comes as a welcome relief. The action sequences feature relatively poor choreography but there's a fast pace and the editing isn't half bad. I was also surprised at just how many familiar faces feature in support. Temuera Morrison, Nicholas Worth, Tommy Tiny Lister, Jack Noseworthy, Clint Howard, and Xander Berkeley are all in this, with Steve Railsback presiding over things as the master villain; playing spot the actor is fun in itself. Most of the cheapjack action is saved for the climax, which homages MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR before finishing with a cheesy crane set-piece.",

But as I stumbled upon the movie once again here in 2022, I opted to sit down and watch it for a second time.Granted, I wasn't really harboring much of any expectations to the movie, given the premise of the storyline and plot, and also because the movie was starring Pamela Anderson (Lee).Well, \"Barb Wire\" is a watchable movie. Its script and storyline isn't exactly rocket science by any means. Now, I haven't read the comic books, so I am not familiar with the character from that media, but writers Ilene Chaiken and Chuck Pfarrer managed to put together a cheesy enough storyline for the movie.While \"Barb Wire\" isn't exactly an outstanding movie or a cinematic gem, then it was actually a fun and cheesy watch. You just simply unhook your mind, lean back in the seat and munch on the snacks.I will say that the movie actually had a handful of recognizable and adequate actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Udo Kier, Temuera Morrison, Jack Noseworthy, Tom Lister Jr. And Clint Howard. So there are definitely some familiar faces on the screen. Needless to go into details of speculations of why Pamela Anderson was in the leading role.And while speaking of Pamela Anderson, then the whole first scene with the spraying water and the dancing, seriously? Was something like that really necessary for the movie?\"Barb Wire\" is a movie that you will quickly forget about once you've seen it and a day or two passes. It is watchable enough for the cheesy movie that it is.My rating of \"Barb Wire\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

            "content": "Ah, nothing. Just like I thought.Let's face it, Pamela Anderson can NOT act. Barb Wire is so obviously nothing other than an excuse to get the most famous blonde on the planet into a bunch of chesty outfits and occasionally not even that much that that fact alone provides much of the film's comic relief. This movie reminds me of a similar crapfest that Anna Nicole Smith put out the year before, called Skyscraper, which was basically a remake of Die Hard but without the acting, the budget, the script, or the brains. Similarly, Barb Wire does not do much to cover up how extensively it borrows from Casablanca. And also similarly, this time without the acting, the budget, the script, or the brains.Whenever you have a film that stars someone like Pamela Anderson, who is famous more for getting naked than anything else, it's not hard to predict that at some point during the film, she will pose as a stripper or a prostitute or something in order for the film to get her out of her clothes, and I'm pretty Pam does both here. There's a thin storyline involving politics and secret weapons and Canadian money, of all things, and this, along with just about everything else in the film, is set on the back burner in favor of the emphasis on Pam's breasts, which are clearly more famous than she is.With movies like Barb Wire, I always try to look for a point where the film admits that it is not trying to be taken seriously. Bad movies can be highly entertaining when they come off as campy (see any of the three Evil Dead movies, the funniest and most entertaining horror films ever made), but not when they pretend to be something that they're not. I think that the biggest problem in this area about Barb Wire is that Pam seems to take her role too seriously (her reaction to the term `Babe' is a case in point). And I say `seems' because there is always the possibility that she is over-acting just for the overall fun of it. However, it's just hilarious how serious she appears and how she makes such an effort to sound threatening, when in reality it's totally obvious that it's all a joke.In this sense, it's difficult to judge this film because it's hard to know how it feels about itself. Personally, I think that the film has grossly overlooked the fact that the vast majority of itself as a whole is going to come off in theaters (or, in this case, on video, seeing how this movie had been booed out of theaters before many people even knew it was there yet) as comic relief. Barb Wire is not really an action movie that makes every excuse possible excuse to get Pamela Anderson out of her clothes, but rather a comedy that amusingly poses as an action film, and the strange thing is that the nude or semi-nude scenes don't lead to sex scenes or anything like that, but usually to violence. This, I guess, is in bad taste depending on your personal views, but it's interesting to consider how many people consider BOTH of these to be in bad taste.Okay, I have to add something here. I just re-visited the Barb Wire home page on the IMDb, and the tagline for the film, which I never noticed, is based on one of the dumbest things about the entire movie.`Don't call me babe.'Sigh",

In fact, her acting is half achieved by her two best assets. Sadly, she doesn't haven't much else to fill the screen with the rest. She should be trying to inject comedy no matter how cheesy it sounds. It can't really get much cheesier and that's not this movie's weakness.

She knows exactly what she is and keeps a strong sense of humour and fun. This should be applauded.

We find out that she's really on a mission to rescue a schoolgirl from some pervs at a strip joint. But she isn't all heart, she demands full payment from the kid's parents, even taking their car and leaving them stranded in a bad neighborhood.Okay, it's 2019, the Second American Civil War, where a Nazi-like government has taken over the country. (Hey, isn't that going to happen in 2012, when Trump becomes President?) Steel City, like Casablanca, if a free port where people can get out of the country. Barb Wire, who is supposedly famous there (but not to pervs in a strip joint, it seems)runs a bar called the Hammerhead. A Government scientist named Cora D is fleeing to Canada to prove that the Congressional Directorate unleashed a deadly plague upon the people. Her ticket out is some specially made contact lenses that confuse retinal scanners. Hot on her trail are fascist officers of the Government.So what you have is Casablanca with reversed genders, lots of car chases and explosions, and some incredibly bad acting. Oh, yeah, and Pamela gets upset when people call her \"Babe\".If there is one thing I am grateful for, it is that even though they plagiarized all the major characters from Casablanca, they didn't feel the need to plagiarize the dialog. That really would have been too much. What made Casablanca a great movie was its subtly, something lost on modern filmmakers. I suspect if it were ever remade in full, it would look more like Barb Wire than the original.Overall, it is not the horrible movie everyone made it out to be. It isn't good, but it isn't horrible.",

Pamela really shines through the drivel.  Barb Wire may not be great stuff, but it's definetly not the disaster so many people have said it is.  I for one am hanging out for a sequel.",

I guess I can't complain; The Matrix references Superman after 100 years.Don't hate me \u2013 I didn't hate this movie. Oh, yeah it wasn't good or great, but it wasn't terrible. I actually liked seeing the sassy Pamela Lee Anderson (PLA) in leather and her kick butting ways.I acknowledged right away: this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature, so I let loose. And if you do, PLA is kinda fun and sexy. (And that's coming from a gay male.)So, what we have here is Post-Civil War II and a mercenary-for-hire but only to keep her night club afloat. Her past(s) get in the way and she truly must decide what side she doesn't want to be on.Yeah. I watched this as part of my mission of movies to see from the How Did This Get Made podcast list. Otherwise, I wouldn't have ever seen it. Did I hate it? Again, no. It was fun 1990s garb never to be taken seriously.For some reason \u2013 again from a gay guy \u2013 I found her sexy and ridged enough to like and care about her making it alive to the end. While not the best 1990s action film, I would actually still, unbelievably, recommend it!* * * Final thoughts: I try to do no research before I see a movie \u2013 I love to go in fresh and cold. I knew of this movie years (almost decades) ago, but never gave it a second thought until it popped up on my How Did This Get Made podcast list. OK, I knew it existed, was on the HDTGM list and it starred the voluptuous PLA, but what I wouldn't learn until following my viewing was that\u0085this was a retelling of Casablanca??? Wow. I guess so. I already knew the story wasn't anything new, but to put this anywhere near Casablanca is just...crazy talk. Just leave your brain at the door and watch this fun little movie.Oh, and I almost forgot. This movie sparked my quote of the day at my employment: \"How can you get Pamela Lee Anderson and Anna Nicole Smith confused?\" asked a coworker after I did just that.\"How can you NOT get the two confused? Sorry, I meant four,\" I responded.",

The movie was uninteresting, and I found myself agreeing with critics and audiences alike in expressing their dissatisfaction with this movie. It was no surprise that Barb Wire was a box office failure and easily one of the worst movies of 1996.Barb Wire could have been so much better, even a cult classic, however it was not meant to be.

            "content": "Oh what fun to watch a film like Barb Wire; a film so bad, it's good as they say. But to say this is terrible and painful to watch would be untrue \u0096 it's bad but it's that B-Movie bad that keeps the film on that thin line between watchable and un-watchable. Barb Wire is a film that is so audacious in its ideas and settings that it has to set itself further into the future to compensate for its obscure nature and content. What I'm referring to is the corrupt government run country that is the USA since they're into their second civil war: \"It was the Second American Civil War and the world had gone to sh*t.\" says Barbara Kopetski (Anderson). Oh right, the 'world' has gone down the pan too has it? I shouldn't think anything was wrong with anything else elsewhere, love (or should that be 'babe'?) In this world, the government officials wear Nazi-like uniforms complete with caps and cloaks; all the civilians apparently wear bondage gear and I think I even spied some of the customs officers early on using AK47 machine guns: a favoured gun/symbol of guerrilla and communist warfare. I was puzzled about the bondage gear: If Steel Harbour is the only free city left in America and people are walking around in clothing that signifies the pleasure of being restrained, then what are all the other 'un-free' cities like? I suppose they must be the sorts of places where murder is legal or something. Anyway, Barb Wire is a film that places itself in history. It's a story about a hard bodied female hero going mano-on-mano with other men in a violent nature. Reagan's term had ended; the cold war had finished: we didn't need any more anti communist Rambo films; we didn't need any more films like Rocky IV where hard bodied American and Russian men beat the hell out of each other and we didn't need anymore western supremacy in the form of muscle man Schwarzenegger kicking arse in his films of the 1980s. No; Barb Wire is about a woman, written BY a woman but generally comes off as a bit of a dud.The actual idea for this film on paper is nothing more than a B-Movie action film wanting to get made. Its premise of a leather clad hero out 'kicking ass' and rounding up all the dregs whilst living in a sadomasochist's wet-dream is the general theme of the film \u0096 it's so watered down and one dimensional in its premise that it needs to rip off Casablanca to get across any sort of plot. Barb Wire is a series of scenes from the beginning up until the forty minute mark consisting of Barb seducing, fighting, cuffing and knocking out men dressed in gimp suits with over-sized paddles - OK, well that last example only happens once but it's still there. Once it seems there is an actual narrative to be told in Barb Wire, the film cools down a bit and relies on Barb to narrate what's going on and how she's feeling in true noir style; needless to say it's more funny than entertaining. I don't usual write or talk about acting in a film because it's not something I usually notice; plus who am I to slate someone's acting? If I tried what they're doing I'd probably be awful but Pamela Anderson in this film deserves a special mention. Her eyebrows, eyes and lips do her acting here as she quivers and flexes these parts of her face in a vain and painful attempt to get across some sort of mood or emotion as to what Barb is actually feeling. Along with this, she talks in a low and gruff manner than just oozes the sort of accent you'd probably get on a phone sex line.I know you cannot take a film like Barb Wire seriously but usually when I get this feeling, it's because the film has been aimed at a child audience. This film is anything but aimed for a child audience: Anderson struts around in a series of costumes; each one different as the settings change. There are extensive shots of her night club named 'Hammerhead' as Gothic bands and dancers hang out, have fights and dance. There is even room for some apparent squaddies dressed in their normal soldier gear to make an appearance but why they're there, I just don't know. While we are spared horrid, juvenile rock music that is being spurted out from the band (you'd think music would've evolved a little by 2017) for long enough; you cannot escape the obvious references to S&M as women walk around in corsets, boots up to their knees and wear sunglasses indoors. I was surprised there weren't a few scenes set in a makeshift dungeon inter-cut with these tracking shots. Maybe Barb could expand her business and set up some bondage facilities: might earn her some money on the side. After all, why would everyone where what they wear in public anyway? Incidentally, when one woman in being 'tortured' by the government very early on via electric shocks; she is moaning in sheer delight, not pain, at the activity.But above all this, the film lets itself down on a technical level. The bad guy's target is right there in front of him and when the scanner fails, he lets them go despite up to this point checking everyone's I.D. card for good measure. He doesn't check these individual's cards because the film would've ended right there! The 'search' of Barb's club is also more of a ransack: ale kegs are shot to bits and shelves housing glasses are crashed to the floor: you never know, the missing thing could be there(!) The film's final fifteen minutes is pure garbage but what did you expect? For the fetishist inside you, this film is maybe fun \u0096 for everyone else, it's dross.",

            "content": "Well , at least when the movie came up . Now barely anyone remembers it . It's not strange since this \"magical\" movie had achieved 2 unusual things : a) the comic book series on which the movie was based died shortly after the movie premiere and b) the producers shortly after the premiere of this \"masterpiece\" OFFICIALLY announced that there won't be a sequel. Wow . I don't remember anything similar in my life . Even \"Batman and Robin' didn't killed the Batman comic books (yes , I know that is a MUCH stronger franchise than Barbwire franchise , but \"B&R\" did have THAT strength to kill anything associated with it). And today we live in an era where even \"Alvin and chipmunks\" have sequels. The movie is based on a comic book I've never read or even heard of . Not that I regret it . Some comic books are hard to stand while you read them and perhaps even unadaptable (\"Spawn\" anyone ?). I believe this is a perfect example.I have a theory that from time to time Hollywood makes a movie that is such a compilation of everything bad in American cinema (style over substance , kitsch , stupidity , bad taste , cheap at heart) that it has a power of nuclear bomb which destroys everything in it's range . \"Barbwire\" isn't really a movie made with BAD TASTE , it's more like a movie made with NO TASTE .The ideal symbol of no taste is the star of \"Barbwire\" itself \u2013 Pamela Anderson . There is a scene here where she walks down a corridor . You see her breasts first . Almost ONLY her breasts . You will have to wait a few seconds before the rest of Anderson's body (including her face) will show up . I mean seriously \u2013 those breasts are walking by themselves. I can't believe somebody so UGLY was considered to be a sex symbol of the 90's . Maybe people deep down are very primitive like caveman ? Sure , it's good when a woman has more big than small breasts , but not TOO BIG . Otherwise she becomes a parody of herself. Anyway , Anderson was considered sexy and someone thought that big boobs will be enough to make a good or at least commercially successful movie. If you're a fan of Anderson's body you will be probably happy . She wears tight clothes and you can see her boobs few times. As for her acting skills \u2013 well she's better than Steven Seagal , but that's hardly accomplishment. The movie is pretty much a remake of \"Casablanca\" only set in post apocalyptic future. It's kinda interesting how you could take one of the best screenplays in the world and f*** everything that was perfect in the original movie. I guess that what you get when you replace Bogart with boobs. Visually this movie rips off \"Batman\" and \"Mad Max\". There is no interesting character and you couldn't care less what happens in the movie. A movie scene where half naked woman kills a guy with stiletto pretty much defines what this whole movie is all about. While watching a bad movie I often think \"A porn version of this movie would be much better\". Funny thing \u2013 I don't think that even as a porn movie \"Barbwire\" would be watchable.I give it 1/10.",

Yes, squeezed into a black leather girdle she does draw the attention of the average teenage male but I have to admit the movie makes a failed but earnest attempt at a story.We are in the year 2017 during America's Second Civil War. A dictator has taken over the country and Barbara Kopetski is a nightclub owner who steers clear of the political scene and tries to run and honest business. She gets involved with an old flame and a deal to buy free passes to Canada. If this sounds a bit like 'Casablanca' don't think you've hit on anything new. Strangely enough, the movie credits the writer of that film without using the title.The movie opens with Barb undercover as a stripper, dancing nude on a trapeze while being sprayed with a hose. She is accompanied by a rock score and a lot of strobe lights and if you sit there and wonder what the point of this scene is, then your Daddy needs to have a long talk with you.Unlike Bogie, Barb doesn't exactly stroll around in a white dinner jacket. Her dominatrix Barbie doll wardrobe consists of black leather, a form-fitting bustier and spiked heels, which come in handy when anyone calls her babe. Lee constantly sneers 'Don't Call Me Babe!' hoping it will become the next catchphrase like 'Make My Day'. Ms. Lee is not a good actress but in this film it hardly matters. No one who saw it could admit going to see the movie for its story.But what story there is, is at least a good attempt. I complain when classic movies are remade.

She gets wind that, Chief of Police Willis (Xander Berkeley) is looking for a fugitive, Dr. Corrina Devonshire (Victoria Rowell) who has information about a biological weapon being developed by a corrupt, Colonel Pryzer (Steve Railsback). Her former lover, Axel (Temuera Morrison) shows up at the bar asking Barb to help him and the Dr. find a pair of special contact lenses that will allow Corrina to evade into Canada so she can blow the whistle on the Colonel. Everything goes wrong and Barb swings into action to save the day.I had a real hard time following this film and I actually forget the first act when the second act kicked in. It's awfully confusing and jumps from more things that it can't handle. It feels like they took a bunch of ideas and just jammed them into the picture to attempt to tell a story and it doesn't work. I had to go back and read, just to remember what happen in the first act and to attempt to figure out what the plot was. It opens with Barb stripping on a pole while she is being sprayed in slow motion to the opening credits. This should come as no surprise for an opening.There are a lot of similarities here to the 1942 Classic \"Casablanca.\" It takes place in the year 2017 where the city is in the middle of a war and there is something about HIV in there that is used to wipe something out. Anyway, Barb lives in the last free city on earth and her headquarters for all her business is the nightclub. This is one of the major locations in the film. I also discovered that Barb is inspired by a comic book character. I should have known that just from looking at the release poster. Barb is suited up in leather and rides a motorcycle in the first act where she poses as a hooker and attempts to trick some loser into a good time to gain access so she can rescue a hostage only to shoot her way out of the apartment building. There are a lot of science-fiction looking gadgets and gizmos in the film that look cheap on top of the production. Everything looks colored in Grey and a blurry sky is a horrible backdrop for the post-apocalyptic setting.Most of the second act is Pamela showing herself off because of who she is. She lays in a tub that would have to be made of glass and when she gets up to get a towel all the bubbles are magically covering up her parts. Just before she manages to put a robe on, she swings it open in full view of the camera like this is supposed to mean something. Pamela is not the greatest actress and comes off as eye candy that gets tiring when everything that is happening is making you scratch your head. She comes off as trying to hard to be this bad-girl mercenary that everyone is supposed to know. I will say this, compared to the other actors in the film, Pamela is the one that attempts to work. She's not a terrible actress, the filmmakers just put her in a movie because of her boobs and didn't know what to do with anything else.The other actors are so bad, it makes you wonder how they got hired. Anyway, the plot doesn't really give us a detail about this \"war\" because it's too busy focusing on several other subplots to become too crowded. One of the characters in this picture is a big fat black stereotype as he is always eating Chicken, not to mention offensive, that is wedged in the shovel of a caterpillar tractor called, Big Fatso (Andre Rosey Brown). He shows up just to become a backstabber before being blown to hell with a grenade. None of the characters matter in the picture and we feel nothing for them.Apparently, Barb is the key to solving the whole situation that is going on but it mentions it and then never brings it up again. in favor of something stupid happening in the background. The screenplay was written by two people, Chuck Pfarrer who is actually a former U.S. Navy Seal and the other one is, Ilene Chaiken. Neither of them can write a screenplay and it shows. Anyway, the ending is what you would expect and the whole movie comes to a close.

I also liked the blind brother a little, and had some fun with the plot; although it isn't overly impressive, it does keep things moving.I give it 4/10.  It kept me entertained, but the fat guy character was horribly done (bad scenes, hammy acting, terrible!!) and of course Pam's acting skills are fairly thin, which keeps this from having any chance of a high rating.  Could have been somewhat better; not as terrible as a lot of the reviews here claim.  If you want to know what a REALLY awful movie looks like, see \"Freddy Got Fingered\".

But I found the movie carries its self-aware campiness right through to the end, with enough wit and craziness to freshen the mix. Pamela's sexy and serious, scene-stealing performance deserves more respect than it almost certainly got. There isn't a scene that Anderson walks through that didn't grab my attention.The director David Hogan keeps the action moving and loaded with fights, gun battles and other action-trashy thrills.

The sad thing is that Anderson can act. It's not Academy Award material acting, but it's better than average fare. The scene with her dog dragging a drunk out of her business is well performed and a very humorous and witty narrative. It adds new meaning to the phrase, \"Roll over, Spot!\"Unfortunately, few have the courage to rate the movie on its objective merits and instead play a two-faced game of rating the actor's real life vice the movie performance.The plot is quite interesting, and given where the world appears headed right now, with a rise in authoritarianism, scripting these events to play out between 2017 to 2019 has a downright nervous tension to it.There are great many plot twists, and the acting plays out the narrative effectively. That said, the movie isn't intended to be taken seriously. It's a full on popcorn epic, with a fair amount of cheesecake thrown in.Truth be told, if we're to be honest with ourselves, whether the star actor posed a half dozen times in a men's magazine shouldn't factor in to how we evaluate a movie. If we believe in people choosing the life they live, then we have to embrace those decisions with an open mind, or else we're just two-faced charlatans.So, take the advice to lighten up and watch the movie expecting some brief entertainment.

If sitting in the corner throwing their poo at passers by can be called \"doing the job\".And at least they could have picked a stunt double who at least looks vaguely like Pam.

If you want to see Pam Anderson topless, at probably the freshest point of her silicone bubblieness, this movie is probably as good as it gets. The rest of the picture, well, it is an incoherent meltdown and plays out similarly to \"Battlefield Earth\" and \"Batman & Robin.\" Expect a lot of inane character development, a ludicrous story, baffling scene direction; completely subpar action sequences, and unconvincing acting. Unlike the aforementioned films, though, you get to see Pam Anderson run around in leather corsets, bikini tops, and Go-Go boots, which does add a certain something. There are a few topless scenes, but nothing as good as the music video. Lastly, this movie has more anachronisms than I have ever seen; it is just unbelievable. Almost every scene will have you saying something like \"um...the cops drive 1986 Crown Victorias....in 2017?\" Anyway, this movie is going to have limited appeal.

The kinky prostitution scam, for example, is a grueling, humorless 3+ minute setup for a lackluster action scene that is followed by a grueling, humorless payoff scene that's just as long.Worse, whole scenes are completely superfluous. The scenes where Axel and Cora get into the city are unnecessary and unexciting. The drunk who is taken care of by Camille is both valueless to the plot and totally unfunny.

Her delivery of the requisite quips is awful, and her signature line \"Don't call me babe!\" is much weaker than anything Eastwood or Swartzenegger might ever have uttered\u0085 The film makers undoubtedly recognized that they were making a bad film. Why else cast such an obviously-untalented actress in the lead role? What they seemed to be banking on is that Barb Wire would at least be fun, which it isn't. The element of high camp that makes for enjoyable \"good trash\" isn't present. Bad movies like this often generate small cult followings, and that's about the size of audience the picture deserves\u0085 Unfortunately, other than a couple of very obvious, absurdly over-the-top scenes, this film is just plain boring. Aside from observing Pamela Anderson Lee's apparent assets, the only reason to stay awake during Barb Wire, is to admire what Tommy Lee did\u0085Watching Pamela scale a barbed wire fence naked would not only be more entertaining, but a lot less painful than sitting through this monotonous, very \"Rusty\" film",

Those who know me better know what that is. Her corset outfit with those boots are just the right stuff. A lot of that and leather.So what on earth is wrong? It took me some time to figure out what's wrong with this movie and Pamela Anderson - or rather the character she plays.The problem is, Barb Wire is a man! I don't know, that just dawned to me after the umpteenth time I watched this film. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the character, as the exterior seemed just right.But Barb Wire is a man! That's the problem. She's a man. The exterior is from men's wet dreams. Clearly. It's so much from the wet dreams that it turns her into a man.That made me understand the whole thing better and made it somehow enjoyable. Maybe it's the \"don't take it too seriously\" department that others have mentioned around here.But that kind of made it work for me. Strangely.",

Watching the trailers I expected more than I got but it was still enough. Despite it lacking orginal story, good acting and someone that you would care about in this movie besides Pam; it is not as bad as everone says. To me the worst sin that film can commit is being boring, which is something that I have not experienced here. The best characteristics of Barb Wire are the very well done action sequences and sexuality of the main protagonist. I mean c'mon, who would watch anything with Pamela anderson if it wasn't for her boobs. as much as I don't find women attractive and as I as woman I should say that she is just portayed as an sex object,but I think that is the whole fun in it! This movie is not pretending to be anything else than it is; a cool B-class film. I will definitely watch it again. For me it is way better than the Prometheus which I absolutely hate.",

            "content": "It's easy to laugh at a failure: let's check why it happened instead... That movie was never intended to be a masterpiece, but a honest and camp entertainment. In those years, it was still normal to produce films with a low budget, so they did it: a star (remember, there weren't reality show then), a story (based on comics), and a production team (related to Polygram, I suppose) . What went wrong? First of all, it needed more money, for the locations, the costumes and everything you have to buy to put it in a movie. The director is a music clip director, so he lacked experience, and you can really tell! The script is not bad even if the screenwriter did better elsewhere. The cast is ok, Udo is great and Pamela played quite good (I mean... it isn't Shakespeare, but she works) . A great problem is sexyness: you have got a sexbomb but you can't pass certain limits; it is obviously a fatal error, you must dare sometimes, but the worst is that Pam is often not at all sexy, on the contrary almost ridiculous (like H. Berry in Catwoman, not like M. Pfeiffer in Batman returns). Think about how the director of X-Men \"loved\" and enhanced Mystica, can you see what I mean?! Besides, in those years music was still important in an action movie, but here it's boring and annoying (and very cheap). However, I still watch Barbwire, sometimes, because it isn't boring like a 400.000.000 dollars blockbuster for dummies and when you watch it you can think how it could be, on the contrary those big movies are (almost) always the same...",

And have to say its probably one of the best remakes ever, even if it strays a bit from the original Casablanca.True. Pammy is not as good an actor as Bogart, and she doesn't have anything like the same chemistry with Bobba Fett that he had with Ingrid Bergmann.It's also true that the dialogue isn't quite as (mis)quotable. Don't call me babe isn't really up there with I think this might be the start of a beautiful friendship.And I have to admit, that even allowing for a good cover of dancing barefoot, it didn't have any songs up up there with \"As Time Goes By\".It's also true that the guy playing the Peter Lorre character is doing a bad impression of the original so obvious you'd believe he thought himself to be in a cheap knock off of a much better film.But look what it gets right.It's way ahead of its time with all the gender and race swapping.In predicting the second American Civil war would happen in 2017, it was only 6 or 7 years out (we'll find out soon enough)But most importantly, it has Pamela Anderson in wet PVC. In the opening credits.Great movie.Play it again, Pam.",

The Pamela Anderson phenomenon passed me by without me taking much notice. I couldn't see that much attractive about a chick with a pudgy face, too much badly applied makeup and those horrible eye brows... and then I watched Barb Wire.Oh right now I get it, she's not what I'd call a beauty but she's got a pot of pneumatic that just never runs out. Yeah there are problems with the film, the tone is a too light, too comical; during one particular scene, early in the narrative which should be disturbing and dark, I find myself laughing quite hard because it's just played so wrong. There is a secondary character that steals the climax from Barb Wire which is quite annoying but mostly the film works well, it has good a visual feel without it being overworked.",

My twin sister Betty Ceniza in the Detroit area bought this thing and gave me the following \"critique\": Who in their right mind decided to make this movie! It is Casablanca with explosions...but without the romance as people keep falling over. However there are Pam's boobs. They are everywhere. This could have been a \"tits & a$$\" movie but there is just Pam's tits and nobody's ass. Very bizarre to say the least. Pam plays the Bogart role, Temuera Morrison plays the Ingrid Bergman Role and Victoria Winters plays the Paul Heinried role. There are also people playing the Sidney Greenstreet roe, the Claude Rains and Conrad Veidt roles. This isn't WW2 but a future America that has become two armed camps. The scientist Victoria Rowell knows some secret but Betty was so hypnotized by Pam's boobs she can't remember what it was. Pam literally follows them into the room. After lotsa explosions and everybody saying sh%t (their byword in this movie) the heroes prevail. Pam is very shapely and good in the actions scenes but she really cannot act. At least Tem Morrison and Victoria Rowell can act as both of them are soap opera veterans and managed to lend some believability to their roles. Although having just seen Star Wars Episode 2 it looked like Jango Fett married to Drucilla Winters of Y&R. How did they get talked into this? The DVD had a section of \"deleted sexy scenes\" but all you saw was Pam swinging upside down on a trapeze, boobs exposed with water hitting her for extra affect, maybe so she could stay conscious??? All in all a very bizarre movie but at least the action kept you somewhat interested.",
