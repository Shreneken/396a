            "content": "The first movie was great. The second wasn't so great, though it's not quite as bad as you've heard. Especially with there now being an even WORSE entry to this series - this being it!Someone questioned why Warner Bros. didn't have the distribution rights to this entry. Well, at first they did. I remember reading a (very negative) review of this movie in \"Variety\" magazine, and Warner Bros. was set to distribute. It's quite obvious now that Warner Bros. threw away its distribution option (probably after seeing how horrible this movie is), and Miramax picked it up for a tiny release that lasted 5 minutes. (In my city, it only played for a few weekend matinees).Oh yeah, what did I think of this movie? Quite frankly, it sucked. What were they thinking when they decided to jazz up the movie with contemporary rock 'n roll???? And most of the movie actually takes place not in the fantasy world, but in this world. The characters are especially obnoxious (especially the rock baby), and suffer from stereotypes. Plus, the movie seems to have forgotten a lot of what happened previously - the hero's dad knew about Fantasia, so the hero didn't have to hide anything from him - but for some reason, the hero keeps the incidents he was involved in a secret. The low point comes where the climax is not solved with magic or intelligence - but with karate. Yes, karate.",

            "content": "This movie was awful, easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen, though not quite as abysmal as Home Alone 4, honestly that film is blasphemy. I love the first NeverEnding Story and consider one of the all time great fantasy films, and the second one while disappointing was pretty good, but this one was garbage. Sorry I hated it, it has none of the magic of the first film, none of the sense of wonder that enthralled me when I first saw NeverEnding Story as a child. The scenery was not at all good, dull and rather tacky, I just wonder whether the producers saw the first film for their inspiration, because actually in the first film, the sumptuous set design should've got an award, for it was fantastic. The script here was dreadful, and the plot was uninspired, and had many inconsistencies with the first film(ie. the omission of Atreyu and anything to do with Bastian's family). Not to mention the rushed ending and the rather cartoonish design of Falcor and his voice(ugh!). Even the acting was poor, Jason James Richter has little of the innocence and heroism and even the likability of Bastian, no matter how hard he tried. Jack Black, who I usually find entertaining was wasted and it doesn't help his character was such an unlikeable jerk, as was the usually brilliant Freddie Jones. All in all, awful, awful, awful! See the first film instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "When this film showed up on the cable listing, I had a sudden urge to see it even though I knew it was probably going to be terrible. The original was such a staple of my childhood, yet had such an incomplete ending, that I was intensely curious to see what they would do with another sequel. Besides, I knew that it could not possibly be worse than \"The NeverEnding Story II.\"Boy, was I wrong.\"The NeverEnding Story III\" has rightly earned its place among IMDb voters as the 79th worst movie of all time. It is so bad that, in writing this review, I risk making it sound like it's worth watching, sort of like \"Plan Nine from Outer Space.\" I assure you, this film is in no way in the Ed Wood category of being so incompetently done that it becomes enjoyable to watch. Those moviegoers who take pleasure in seeing cinematic disasters should be forewarned about this one, lest they never again be able to erase from their memory Rockbiter's gravelly-voiced version of \"Born to be Wild,\" played in a video sequence early in the film and again during the end credits.No, I am not joking.The second film does have its admirers, and as much as I hated it, I sort of understand where they're coming from. At least that film had a legitimate purpose, to tell the second half of the novel which the first film had neglected to do. But now the story is finished, so the third film has to make up its own reason for being, with an even shabbier budget than that of the second film. So it concocts a story that allows us to see as little of Fantasia as possible. Here, a series of magical mishaps causes a bunch of creatures from Fantasia to be transported into the real world. These include Falkor the luck dragon, a baby rockbiter about the size of a fountain statue, and a talking tree. (Falkor, who must have gotten a lobotomy sometime between the second and third film, will chase after a \"dragon\" at a Chinese festival.) What we do see of Fantasia makes the place seem a lot smaller than I had ever imagined. Almost all of the scenes there take place in the empress's chamber in the Ivory Tower, though there is also one sequence where we get to see Rockbiter's home (just what I've always wanted to do!) with Mama Rockbiter and of course the previously mentioned Baby Rockbiter sitting in front of a large stone TV set. Needless to say, the inhabitants of Fantasia seem to possess quite a bit more knowledge of Earth than they did in the first film. When the gnome describes Bastian as \"not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger in the muscle department,\" we're reminded how much more enjoyable the film would probably be if Schwarzenegger were actually in it.The cause of these events is that a gang of school bullies steals the book and discovers that it gives them the power to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Fantasia. Strangely, these modern kids never seem surprised that magic exists. Think how long it took in the first film for even imaginative, ten-year-old Bastian to become convinced of the book's supernatural qualities. These bullies, much older and more concrete, never go through such a skeptical period. And later, when the Auryn falls into the hands of a teenage girl, she treats it with about the same level of awe as if she got hold of her parents' credit card.There are actually some familiar actors in this mess. Mr. Koreander is played by the British character actor Freddie Jones, Bastian is played by the kid from \"Free Willy,\" and the main bully is played by a relatively young Jack Black, who now probably would like to do with this film what George Lucas wants to do with the \"Star Wars Holiday Special.\"",

The plot is poor, Falcore looks extremely cartoonish as do the Rockbiters, and the Nasties...well, they just aren't that scary.

            "content": "I have watched many, many more movies than the average normal person. My tastes are varied...classic films, foreign films, silents and more. But one of my odder pursuits is my weird desire to watch all 100 of IMDB's Bottom 100 List....the 100 lowest rated major release movies. It's important to point out that I have never seen any of the \"Neverending Story\" films and I started with #3. And, since it made the list I thought I'd give it a watch.In this film, Bastian is a kid who appears to be about 10 or 11 year-old. Oddly, he's begun at a new school...one that allows 'kids' there who are nearing retirement age (or so it seems). This small kid is chased and assaulted by a group of 20-something punks (led by 25 year-old Jack Black) and they're going to beat the stuffing out of him. To escape, he uses his magical book to enter the land of Fantasia. The problem is that the punks find the book and keep it...somehow realizing that will keep him stuck in Fantasia forever. But apparently there is another way out....and it's long and complicated and boring. And, somehow, some creatures from Fantasia were accidentally brought to the real world with Bastian...and he needs to find and return them.The Henson creatures vary. A few look really nice. A couple seem rather dated and creepy. What's REALLY dated is the introduction, where you see some very early CGI which looks horrid today. Perhaps in 1994 folks were impressed by it.What doesn't vary much is the writing and acting. The story seemed tired and the characters were often annoying. I particularly hated the rock creature who sang Steppinwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" sequence and I assume a lot of folks in theaters felt the same way. I also thoroughly hated the bullies...who were old enough that they should have known how to act...but didn't. At least Black landed on his feet and eventually learned to act.So do I recommend it? No...there are much better kid's films out there that WON'T make parents watching along bored. Plus, smaller kids probably shouldn't see it because the bullies are pretty frightening. And who should see it? Probably no one.In spite of this, I don't think the movie deserves to be on the Bottom 100 and think mostly this was the result of folks who loved the original being so angry about the poor quality of this third film.",

I have been an aficionado of 'bad' movies for quite a long time, adoring those movies which only a group of friends and many drinks makes enjoyable. This movie was in fact so amazingly bad that I could not watch it past the first half hour or so. I only watched the rest via fast-forward the next morning. I've seen many films worse considered classically bad, this one beat them all hands down. I even had to start referring to possibly similar bad movies by saying \"They may be in the NS3 category\". There are those bad movies that are MST3K fun and then there are those that make you wish you had a sharp object to commit suicide with, this one is the latter.This franchise went from excellent original fantasy, special effects for the genre, and well written characters to bad acting and writing in part 2, to movie of the week actors and rubber puppets in part 3. It's amazing how a film franchise that had such good promise sank faster than Lips Manless after taking \"the bath\". Especially if you're considering getting this for the kids, at least treat them to the original movie or something like the Peter Barnes inspired fantasy miniseries' from the late 90s.",

It always ruins a good children's movie that is attempting to take you to \"another world\" when they try to make it hip. The beauty of these films was that they weren't \"hip\"; they were a true departure from the everyday. Isn't that what going into the book in the first place was supposed to represent?

            "content": "OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for \"false advertising\" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying.Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes.See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings \"Born to be Wild\". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL).There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10",

            "review_title": "Easily One of the Worst Sequels Ever Made",
            "content": "Imagine that you are reading an entertainment magazine like \"Entertainment Weekly\" or \"Rolling Stone\", and you happen to look in the news section where they give you information about a movie that is in production. It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax, who has made dozens of Oscar-winning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop, and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it, right? Well, not if it's \"The NeverEnding Story III\".\"The NeverEnding Story III\" is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made, and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based (My review: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/usercomments-250).This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes, bad puns, and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.This time, Bastian is played by Jason James Richter (\"Free Willy\" (1993)). Although Richter looks like a preteen model, he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties (or the Nastys) whose leader is Slip, played by a then-unknown Jack Black.As it turns out, Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander, the owner of the book store in the original story, works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie, and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.Anyway, Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.What's even more contrived is when Bastian, hiding from the Nastys, retreats into the world of Fantasia, only to have Slip retrieve the book, realize its powers, and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies, the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.When Bastian realizes he has to re-enter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia, the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren (the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes), Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him, and be transported into his world, for him to save Fantasia.Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting. There's the Rock-Biter's baby boy who talks in annoying \"baby talk\" that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular, an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny, and two gnomes (Urgl and Engywook, featured in the first movie but played by different actors) who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.Oh yes, and who could forget Falcor, the luck dragon? In the first two movies, Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian, and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite, which made him ever cooler. Here, he not only looks different from the previous two films, but he's whinier and dumber. When, in the real world, he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon, I could only hang my head and wonder, \"Why?\".To make matters worse, Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good, and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately, the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole (Melody Kay) could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes, and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role, despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end, the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying, trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point: the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing \"Born To Be Wild\" by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case, none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies (the Rock Biter, looking like a pint-size version of his predecessor, was the biggest disappointment), and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me, try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released.",

            "content": "I first saw the first movie a few years ago. I loved it and still love it. I saw the second movie a while later. It was okay then. After two or three viewings I saw Michael Ende's name in the opening credits, and decided to find the book and read it. I can't remember whether I saw NES III before or after I read the book.The book was AMAZING. Probably the best stand-alone novel I have ever read. But the problem is: After you read the book, the movies always look worse because it's not like the book. The first movie is basically based on the first half of the book. A few things were changed and/or left out, but it's still a great movie overall.The second movie is basically based on the second half of the book. A lot of things were changed and a lot of things were left out. This decreased NES II's score a lot, but it's still barely an okay movie.Now NES III is based only on the characters of the book. There's Bastian, of course, but in the book and the previous two movies, he doesn't have the attitude anyhow close to getting wild hair. No Atreyu, of course, which was probably one of the worst decisions made in the making of the movie. According to the first movie, Mr. Koreander doesn't like kids. But now he's school librarian, which doesn't make sense. Engywook and Urgl returning was probably a good decision, but their characterization was ruined when they were reduced to complaining about having to go to the bathroom the whole second half of the movie. The Bark Troll (there were bark trolls in the book) is not supposed to know enough about the human world to mention Vegas and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bastian should not have been allowed to keep Junior at his house. Either Bastian would have said, \"No way! I'm not taking him to my house!\" or Junior would have wrecked his house down. Even the Childlike Empress was reduced to an idiot towards the end of the movie. NES III just doesn't have the feel that The Neverending Story was originally designed to have.Positive notes on NES III: Well, the story was actually okay in my opinion. Jack Black is a likable actor. Mr. Koreander's line: \"The story's not over yet, young man\" is the only time in any of the three movies where it talks about the NeverEnding Story's \"unendingness.\" I like seeing the Old Man of Wandering Mountain, but it's not the same part as the book. And the biggest positive note: I liked it a lot better a few years ago, when I wasn't as much of a movie critic as I am now.5/10",

I'll vent my spleen over that mess later.And then, there came this waste of film and effort.

The first two movies covered all the wondrous things within the original book, so I don't understand why this film was made at all. It is just cheesy, stupid, abysmal, and an absolute disgrace to the idea of The Neverending Story.First of all, what's going on with this stepsister of Bastian's that has somehow appeared? Wrong, wrong. . . Then, what happened to good old Falkor? And most of all, where is Atreyu? If you are bold enough to see this film, that is the one thing you will distinctly notice if you've seen the other two- no Atreyu.The boy who played Bastian was not nearly as obnoxious as the actor from the second film, but he just doesn't hold a candle to the original actor, Barret Oliver. I have only seen this movie once, because I was informed of how awful it was, and just had to see for myself. It was a waste of my precious time. I hardly remember the plot line or anything important like that because it just didn't stick with me. One gets the impression that this was made as a sort of kid/family-friendly approach to The Neverending Story, because it is just so simplistic, and sacrifices the charm of the original characters and settings for the sake of being funny and entertaining. But trust me, it is NOT funny and it is NOT entertaining. Any NES fan worth their salt would be appalled by this film. If however you are not familiar with the Neverending Story, see the original 1984 movie and read the book and be contented with that.

I saw the third one in the movie rental part of our grocery store when I was 14, and I got exited. I immediately rented it and brought it home and popped it in our VCR (you remember VCR's don't you?). It was not much longer after that that I was popping it out again. NES3, for lack of a better term,... sucks. The storyline was as unimaginative and vapid as you could hope for, it takes place in the real world, and not(as the title would have you believe)in Fantasia, and I get the feeling that it is because creating a fantasy world was a little out of their budget. This movie has \"low budget\" written all over it. The childlike empress isn't even blond! they get some brunette chick who looks nothing like her to play the role.

Falkor, the wise, soft-spoken luck dragon we know and love, is transformed into a whiney, neurotic character who frequently makes lame complaints, a few concerning his back. Yeccchhh.Then, there's the tree-like character. HIS wisecracks are often related to the human world. (\"Call the fire department!\") If there's one thing I despise, it's modern-Earth humor where it doesn't belong.And the Child-like Empress. This lovely, polite, wise young lady has been mysteriously transformed into the Pre-Teen Empress. At one point, she even referred to someone as \"old man.\" Can you imagine our beloved Stronach-version Empress doing that? Never!The ONLY characters who had anything done right with them were the gnomes. These were actually played fairly well.The story was horrendous.

On the other hand, I had nothing to do, so I decided to watch this just to see how bad it would be.My oh my, the many negative comments I read about this movie have all the reason to be. This movie is garbage, capable of making any fan of the original blush of shame. Seriously, I don't get how in the world did this movie lost its place in the IMDb Bottom 100 because that's where it belongs.This terrible film should have never seen the light of the day. What did they think they were doing? This is not even a shadow of the original. Frankly, this is an offense and mockery on the original and a strong one to win a place of \"honor\" at the Razzies, being the worst of the trilogy.If the 2nd one is already quite bad and a huge mess, this one is even worse. It's a movie without reason to exist. Everything is bad in this movie: the crude puppets and sceneries, the very poor plot, all of the characters (especially the more than annoying bullies, the Nasties) and the crappy lines (such as a reference to Arnold Schwarzenneger and Jean Claude Van Damme).But that's far from being all. The bullies here are really nasty and way more annoying than the bullies from the original film. Just as bad as this or even worse is that here the bullies have the power over Fantasia!Plus, what have they done to good old Falkor? Here he is so ugly and has no personality at all. Here he has nothing to do with the beautiful and happy creature from the 1st film we all love so much. And what's the point of putting Falkor flying next to a Lufthansa plane? Other annoying things are, without a doubt, the walking tree that also talks... bah, I hate that kind of thing! The Rockbiter here is slim and small, so much that I didn't realize it was him until the 2nd half of the movie. Here he's got a wife and a son, Junior. Can't describe how annoying is the Rockbiter and his family here. And now they've got a television? My goodness, what a silly nonsense!The soundtrack is a mistake. I mean, the songs themselves are great, such as \"Born to be wild\", \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\", \"Kiss From a Rose\" and \"Games People Play\". But these songs aren't for a fantasy movie. As for Fantasia, as one can (and should) expect, it hasn't got the magic, enchantment and beauty of the original.Jason James Richter, although he was a competent actor, can't be compared to the charismatic Barret Oliver. Once again, the cast is entirely different. None of the characters feel like those of the original at all. They're a joke instead of captivating. Yet there is nothing funny about them or the movie itself. And that thing of Bastian's new family and lifestyle... no comments.The cast, the director and all the artists involved in the 1st movie must have had quite a shock with this joke of a movie. This has nothing to do with their masterpiece. They must have laughed out loud about how ridiculous this movie is...",

The set has moved to the modern day 'human world' of earth. Climax of movie is at the local shopping mall (during Halloween!). We have 90's music and mannerisms, and a bunch of pathetic bullies called 'The Nasties' are the antagonists. A motley assortment of Fantasia life forms romping about the boring local shopping mall not only looked cheesy, it reeked of the standard, well-used cliche. 'Non-human' characters were very poorly designed, they looked exactly like men in suits, lame-o borrowed from the 70s!Plot line was a very long, (boring) worn-out cliche, unlikely to hold your attention for long. There have already been countless movies done before with the same story line. One gets the feeling of 'made for the pre-teens only'. Unlike the first film, which appealed to all ages, this is a definite yes.CONCLUSION: Not impressed. This whole thing should have stayed where it was created - in the fantasy world the book was based on.",

It's hard to say that I really suffered while watching this because it's so much fun to learn more about it from the Critic's review. I loved hearing the commentary from them saying it was so bad we should all just make our own reviews and I am now! The basic plot is that Bastian uses the book from the first two movies and is pursued by a group of bullies called the Nasties. I remember watching the second movie and being amazed at how bad it was. I'm so glad the awfulness of this film puts that one to shame.The Critic didn't even mention the fact that the secondary character from the first two movies, Atreyu wasn't in this film for no reason. Okay, the reason was that he didn't to be associated with this horrendous film. We get a lot of characters like the Rockbiter's son, a talking tree, and gnomes and you know what? Every single one of these characters is completely and utterly useless. They only make things worse, make stupid jokes like referencing Arnold Schwarzeneggar and making jokes about barking up the wrong tree. The designs, especially the Rockbiter are terrible and stupid looking.The childlike empress and the people she works with are also completely useless, boring and dumb. She never even explains why Bastian can't just wish everything to go back to normal. The second film at least had purpose in that it adapted the second half of the book, although loosely I heard. Falcor is now an idiot who thinks airplanes and paper dragons are living things as opposed to his wisdom from the first movie. We get toilet jokes and a story that really does seem to have no end. There's sort of a sequel hook but thank God this film was so awful it killed off the franchise forever. Zero stars",

After seeing the grumbly rendition of \"Born To Be Wild\" on a Flintstone-esquire motorcycle, I really wanted to turn it off. The movie, at the point, was more painful than my kidney stone.I found this movie to be without much purpose, without much of a solid story, and without intelligent characters.

What happened to the normal red cover? They TRIED to respect the original story, but they failed. Miserably. As a kid I imagined Fantasia as this wonderful imaginary world, full of dreams and illusion. Thanks to this movie, my image of Fantasia has been reduced to Rockbiter buying an electric guitar and joining a Rock band and also Childlike Empress using Aurin for her shopping sprees.

Add to this a scared poodle as a Luck Dragon, something that seemed a parody of a homosexual behaviour as a rock baby, references to the human world from the mouths of all characters, not to mention that all of them, and I mean ALL FANTASIAN CHARACTERS, are there only to move around in silly costumes and say silly things.

Another commenter referred to Falkor as the wise old dragon. Rightly so, and might I add courageous. But in this one, there version of Falkor is a stupid, clumsy, cowardly excuse for a dragon.

After narrowly getting out of a beating, Bastian escapes the real world back into Fantasia. However he cannot hide the book and, although he is safe in the familiar magical world, the book falls into the hands of the bullies. Despite being older, more cynical teenagers, Slip accepts the concept of a magical world within a book surprisingly easily and decides that he will use the book to change the story he wants to hear and the world of Fantasia is yet again under threat \u0096 however this time the people of that world must take the battle into the real world.Having seen the bit in quality between parts one and two already I must admit that I held out limited hopes for part three. Unsurprisingly this film turned out to be stripped of budget, magic, fun and imagination and replaced with a standard story with poor humour delivered by the cheapest bidders. Maybe for budget reasons or maybe just to save the writers having to develop Fantasia any further, the majority of this takes place in the real world. This in itself isn't a big problem but the fact that the script does nothing of value with it is. The story makes big leaps and seems more interested in cheap gags and soap opera dramatics rather than producing a story of magic and excitement which the first film, although not perfect, was (although comparing the first film with the third makes the first look like Citizen Kane). I struggled to care about any of the story and the whole thing was written at the most basic level it could have been.Visually the film looks rubbish. The \"effects\" are at the standard of a television show \u0096 certainly the rock creatures look like they were the characters from Dinosaurs spray-painted grey. The low budget can be seen in the mouths where they are basic flaps without any ability to match words, instead they just flap open and closed. Generally this is the standard and everything looks rubbery and basic \u0096 contributing even more to the lack of magic. The cast shouldn't really be blamed for any of the mess because they are caught up in the blast. Richter is so-so at best and the rest of the cast are all pretty basic. Black is a strange find but I was grateful for me \u0096 he didn't take the p1ss quite as much as I would have liked but he does at least do a watered down version of what would later become his normal routine. The voicework is generally poor, mostly being as cheap as the effects \u0096 the only real surprise was to find Tony Robinson in the midst of it all.Overall a poor film that is completely unnecessary. The effects are as poor as the plot which is as poor as the performances. Lacking any magic or excitement this is a truly horrid product that is the last thing I would want to expose my children to \u0096 I would want them to have higher standards than this.",

The magic that captured me in the first two movies is non existent in this one.I cherished The Neverending Story 1 and 2 when I was a child, and I remember these stories being much more tragic and more magical. In this movie they made the characters a whole lot more silly than they had to be, and they have totally changed the looks of the characters. For instance the stone people were ridiculous and reminded me about Henson's TV-series 'Dinosaurs'. Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.",

            "content": "There is no two without three, people used to say. And the third film in the \"NeverEnding Story\" trilogy is surely the most unpopular and disagreeable of all. And I can see the reason: it almost becomes an insult to admirers of the first film.In this film, Bastian is a preteen who moves with his father to a new home, where he goes to live with a stepmother and her daughter from a first marriage. In addition to the new family and the new city, he will have to go to a new school where there are much older students. And one group in particular, the Nasties, will dedicate themselves to making his life a real hell. Coincidentally (one of those that only happens in films), the school librarian is Koreander, the bibliophile. And of course, the book \"The NeverEnding Story\" is there. Providential! Bastian flees to Fantasia as if the book were a magical portal. There he finds the Empress, now a marriageable beauty, but unfortunately for everyone the book is in the hands of the Nasties, who soon realize their potential and begin to destroy Fantasia. It is up to Bastian to recover the book and restore order, if in the middle of the process he is also able to recover the Auryn, which his new sister will use to get all the clothes she always wanted.The film is a total stupidity if we think of the two predecessors: the whole concept involving the original story (the power of imagination, creativity, the value of reading) is perverted to create a film where fantastic beings enter and leave our world and, by taking a book, we can fall into a surreal and fantastic world. That was the worst thing in the movie. In the other films, the trip to Fantasia was mental and worked better as such since it was something more in line with the film's message: the importance that people should give to reading, creativity and the use of imagination. Despite this, the film is not even so bad if we forget the previous ones. And that is due to one factor: it is effective in comedy. In fact, there are enough comedic moments to be able to swallow it, if we don't take it seriously. The dialogues have many witty strips that sound funny and a lot of effective situational comedy, making the film more palatable than we would expect.The cast has a very recognizable name that we could even think that signed the contract by mistake: Jack Black always assumed himself as a fan of the first film and must have been excited about the project, which justifies why he never wanted to talk about this film again. I would also feel betrayed in my expectations. Even so, he performed well and did a positive job as an actor. Jason Richter was good enough as Bastian and pretty Julie Cox was a decent Empress, but there's no decent material for them, and he just runs around like a fireman, running away or to trying to find this and theirs, as she watches everything on \"television\". Melody Kay was not up to the challenge and is irritating, as are the parents. Freddie Jones was uninteresting, having been happier in the role of Old Man than in the role of Koreander, who is over the top and is just a hook to bring the book to Bastian. The group of villains is clich\u00e9 and uninteresting, more boring than really intimidating.Technically, the film is a shadow when compared to the two predecessors and is guided by a Franciscan poverty regarding the technical aspects: an uninteresting cinematography and washed colors does not appeal to the visual beauty, and the bad scenarios and terrible CGI made Fantasia the fantastic world more depressing of cinema. The effects also add little beauty to the film and the costumes are not convincing. Worst of all, however, was the poor conception of magical creatures, which never looked so artificial and ugly as before: dwarves are so interesting that they literally spend most of the film in a cardboard box, while the son of Rock Biter is simply nauseating and it is clear that it is made of foam. Regarding the sound, we have bad sound effects, horrible incidental music and a soundtrack that is almost nonexistent and where a very ugly version of the famous song \"Born To Be Wild\" reigns, totally without purpose.",

He goes to a new school and gets picked on by the group of bullies called the Nasties, led by a young Jack Black. He goes into the Neverending Story to escape the bullies, but they find the book and start changing it in their image. Chaos ensues. One thing I can say about this movie, is it's actually somewhat entertaining at times because of it's stupidity, where the second film was just boring. But nonetheless, this is still the worst of the films. It seems as though the writer and director didn't think to use the other two movies as references on how the characters should look or act. Falcor in the first film is an intelligent heroic creature, here Falcor has a deep, dumb voice and he serves as the stupid coward comic relief, similar to the Cowardly Lion. The Rock Eaters have totally changed what they look like from massive and wide to skinny costumed characters. One of the worst scenes involves the Rock Eater singing \"Born to Be Wild\", which was horrendous. Atreyu, the co-main character of the last 2 films is gone, and everything about Fantasia has changed in this terrible so-called final Neverending Story film.My rating: BOMB/****. 90 mins. Rated G.",

I have only tried to watch it (tried and failed!) because I bought the Trilogy on DVD, being that it was only a few bucks dearer than buying just the first movie by itself, and it came in a nicer box. Plus, I thought it was a novelty to be able to see Moya Brady in a film (any fans of \"The Bill\" would know her as Robbie Cryer), and there was the added bonus of Jack Black as well.I had extremely low expectations of this film, and I must say, I was still shocked at how bad it was.Worst. Movie. Ever.This film should have NEVER BEEN MADE. Especially since the second film in the trilogy was such a huge disappointment.I find it an absolute insult to the original film, the book, and Michael Ende that this rubbish shares the name \"The NeverEnding Story\". The character of Falcor has been murdered beyond recognition. This was the part that made me really angry, and that really made this a waste of film. Same for Rockbiter. Their appearances were not even accurate, let alone their voices, and Falcor seemed to be a stupid, bumbling fool of a thing. Nothing at all like the Falcor we all loved in the original movie. PATHETIC to say the least.Yet another new cast means that the characters have changed yet again since the second film. Something which I find completely unacceptable. If they insisted on making a 3rd movie after they couldn't get the 2nd one right, then they should have at least kept Jonathan Brandis as Bastian. At least then there would be a shred of continuity (something which is non-existent in this film). This has to be one of the biggest wastes of film, money and time in the world. I can't think of a worse film that I have seen (except maybe \"Freddy Got Fingered\" - that's definitely worse).I'll say it again. This film should have never been made. And that's a fact. If you haven't seen this movie, DON'T EVEN BOTHER. I have it on DVD, and I will not even be watching the ending. It's JUST THAT BAD.1 out of 10 (What an absolute stinker!

There are many things which bring this film down and it is a shame that they actually tried to be like the first one, e.g Rock biter's bike.I'll go through many weakness of this film: - The Bastian character is really weak, annoying, irritating and comes up with the most stupidest accuses ever e.g. when the elves are in the box, he says the parrot I brought, for gosh's sake the bird would have been dead in 2 hours or less.What happen to the giant Rock Biter and why does he have a wife, it was already bad enough that he has freakin kid already. Rock Biter is small and he sings a rock song which is irritating.The Never Ending Story song isn't good and it's not original anymore which ruins the magic.Where the heck is Ateryu? - And even if the acting is good, why are they different.The only good things about this film is the (NOT ALL OF them) funny moments. Jack Black does a great job but that ain't enough and even that Tree Branch is weird.I'd only watch this if I'm bored but that will hardly be ever.... It's a good film for kids from ages 4-7 and that's it.Like the Never Ending Story 2, I really tried to like this but it ain't enough, the magic is gone like I've said, even some of the dialogue is stupid.4/10",

He rides on a motorcycle SINGING. In case you're wondering, I'm not joking. Watch it for yourself.3. The villains are unimaginative. In NES I, the villain was an abstract entity. In II, the villain was in human form. In this one, they're just school bullies. I'm dead serious. Don't believe me? See this movie and watch it for yourself.4. Inconsistencies. Count the stars.

It was a flat-out rant. Now, that I've apologized. Let's write a REVIEW of this film. Not a rant.So what may confuse most people is the title of the film. It's called \"The NeverEnding Story III: Return to Fantasia\", or \"Escape from Fantasia\" depending on where you live in the world. It really should have been called: \"The NeverEnding Story The Adventures of Bastian Bux the Movie\". Because this movie is basically an adaption of an animated show. Not of the book source material which it should have been based on.Let me just say that there are ideas in this film that sound like they COULD be good. Hear me out, think about this. And this only, what if someone evil was in control of the book \"The NeverEnding Story\"? If you think about that alone, that sounds like an interesting concept. Also, if you think, \"What if the creatures from Fantasia got into the real world?\" That sounds great on paper, but not for a movie.The movie just should've been a cartoon. It has musical numbers that could've been fine if it was something like Lion King, but some of them are cringeworthy. Example: Born to be Wild by the Rockbiter! \ud83d\ude16Atreyu is not in this film. Here's the reason why: When he read the script for it, he escaped Fantasia and never came back. That's the reasonable explanation. Also, why are the bullies called the Nasties? They could've been called the Bullies and it would've been better than the nasties. I'm sorry that you had to act in this Jack Black.At least they added the Old Man of the Wandering Mountain, but still. This is a terrible movie. It's amazing how bad they did on this film. It's a disaster! The animontronics are creepy, the villains are annoying, I cannot take Bastian seriously, and the plot needs major work.On the upside, I did love Julie Cox as the Childlike Empress. To me she's the best and prettiest one of all three. I guess it's just because she's British.How I rank the Childlike Empresses:Three: Alexandra Johnes (Did not look like an empress)Two: Tami Stromach (Great role for her, but I like Julie Cox more)One: Julie Cox (The prettiest empress and the most believable).So yeah. Don't ever watch this movie. If you must take something from it. Take the fact that Julie Cox did great. But don't waste any hours of your life or brain cells on this disaster.",

Even though this story has absolute NOTHING to do with the series, all I can say is I actually didn't mind it. I for some odd reason found it quite entertaining and was impressed. I do seperate this movie from the series in general (or else I might begin to hate it), it most likely does better on its own. The original series was actually very serious and alot more dark, especially the first film. I saw \"The Neverending Story 3\" however, as some sort of \"comic relief\" to the series. I do enjoy how it was a little more down to earth and had alot more humour in it. Even though the original actors are long gone, the actors in this movie do portray these \"new\" characters quite well and are believable. If one wants to enjoy this movie make sure you totally seperate it from the original series and DO NOT compare all that much. I will never like this movie as much as the original, I still will watch it for a gag every now and then but it just won't hold the same place in my heart as the originals. If you are HUGE into fantasy and have seen the other movies, give this one a try, 'tis actually not all that bad. Trust me, I have seen worse.",

            "content": "Say what you like about the sequels to The Neverending Story, but at least they do something that most movie sequels utterly fail to do. They dare to continue the story started in the original, rather than simply repeat the first story ad nauseum. This is to be expected to a degree, because the source material was a very long book, of which the first movie covered only the first half. The second movie, therefore, had material to work with without having to repeat the formula (though it was only very loosely based on the original source material). The third movie was another question, because the source material had been used up. This is why I did not have high hopes for this movie.All the same, I waited over twenty-five years to see The Neverending Story III, because the first two movies were a major part of my childhood, as they were for many people. Upon finally sitting down to watch it today, and having heard all the reviews everywhere about how awful it was, I was surprised at how much better it was than I anticipated.The movie is at its best when it is telling the story set in the real world about Bastian adjusting to his new family, and there are quite a few wonderful moments of truth in his relationship with his new sister. It tells a story that many kids that come from blended families can relate to, and I think they can also relate to wanting to escape into a magical book, as Bastian does throughout the series.That said, I found much of the humor unfunny and labored. This is the film's weak spot, but overall I liked it better than the second movie. Though I loved it as a kid, the second movie did not age as well for me because the acting seems subpar in retrospect, especially Bastian and Atreyu (who is absent entirely from this second sequel). However, Bastian in this movie echoed the Bastian from the original, and very much seems like the same character, but older-unlike in the middle sequel, where he largely seems like a different person altogether.Purists and people who grew up with the original movie will likely be disappointed, but I have a philosophy of walking into every movie with an open mind, and therefore, I tend to enjoy most movies more than the average critic-a characteristic that is sadly missing from most reviewers (and which should be a requirement).",

The totally inappropriate pop music heard throughout in a vain attempt to connect with a modern audience?

The unfunny modern jokes about Arnie and runways that the citizens of Fantasia could not possibly know about? Perhaps the poor performances of the parents of our hero Bastian, probably the most unconvincing screen couple ever with their extremely fake squabbling? Or maybe the whole mall sequence, which is so badly directed and scripted it will have you screaming \"WHAT THE HELL?!\" at the top of your voice in front of the television? (Be careful not to disturb the neighbours..)Yes, those are all worthy winners, but for my money what really takes the cake in this debacle is THAT DAMN ROCK BABY. Honestly, everything about it, from that cutesy way it repeats it's one word sentences, to it's ugly features as it wanders around getting in everyone's way, makes me just wanna grab a pneumatic drill and turn the little git into rubble. A pathetic attempt to pander to children, this grotesque creation is NOT funny, NOT cute and is even more annoying than it was when it was introduced in part 2 of this trilogy. Mind you, the other new additions to the cast, like those two chattering dwarfs and the tree creature, aren't particularly endearing either. They are pointless, badly thought out and totally unnecessary.. a bit like the whole film, really.Jack Black has fun in an early role as one of the Nasties (what kind of a name for a high school clique is that?) and the actress who plays Bastian's stepsister is quite charming (if a slightly amateurish thespian) but we're a long way from the superb original here. The series has now degenerated into a knockabout farce for the kids. Except, they won't enjoy it either. With classic fantasies like Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings waiting on the video shelf for them, why would they want to dwindle their time on this twaddle for? I'll leave the final word to the new, impostor Falkor who says just before the credits roll: \"Ooo this is my favourite part!!\" Mine too, mate, mine too.. 3/10",

There is a book which acts as a portal between the real world and Fantasia - a fantasy world where monsters and fairy tales are true. Bullies get the book and cause chaos. Bastian has to save it. World's cross and some of the book comes to reality while some of reality ends up going into the book. The budget was probably bigger for this version of the film and yet it still doesn't help it out. Nor do the star names, Jason James Richter (star of \"Free Willy\"), Melody Kay, and even Jack Black can't save this film. What the hell happened? Was the director smoking crack? The characters that previous films had you love have suddenly become morons, Falcor and the Rock biters are now dumb and annoying. Other established characters have become annoying.

Anyway,for a movie I was basically \"stuck\" watching, all I can say about this movie is, it could have been entertaining. The lead character, Bastian Baltazar, some last name that starts with a B, has moved to a new town with a new \"blended\" family with a boring sister named Nicole and two basically absent parents. Little is said of their family life, however, for most of this takes place at a school, where Bastian shows up with \"weird\" hair and is of course, bullied by a group of geriatric \"teenagers\"(who look about 40)called \"The Nasties.\" The Nasties also act about forty, and it's plainly obvious the writer knows nothing about modern bullies, but at least their teasing Bastian is so overblown and silly that it's entertaining, especially when Bastian has to escape into a storybook(I assume he did this in the other two movies) to hide from them. Too bad the story he picked is some dull, freakish thing that is set in the Godless land of Fantasia, where people follow a child-like empress(does that mean she is a woman in a child suit?) and worship and consult some wizard named Oren(horrors). Even that could have been passably entertaining, since the Nasties find and read \"The Never Ending Story\"(pretty smart bullies)and start to control it in a way where stupid Fantasia goes all wrong, so wrong in fact, that all of the myriads and gnomic creatures of Fantasia have to move down to Earth to escape.And after they did, I stopped paying attention and dubbed the movie quite worthy of its title, \"The NeverEnding Story,\" for it went on and on and on. The little snatches that I caught were all cliched and the ending quite silly, but by then I was so bored I couldn't even laugh. How could a movie with such potential go so horribly awry? Plus Fantasia and all that goes on there gives a horrible message. I'm sure at least one of \"my\" kids is Christian, and this movie is basically presenting Oren as some God and Fantasia as a Heaven. The kids didn't seem to mind any of that stuff and actually sat through the what felt like three-hour running time without a complaint or any kind of sound. That was good. Too bad the movie wasn't.",

It truly was a sadistic and ruthless way to resurrect the franchise. On another side, it ticks all the boxes of how NOT to do a fantasy movie. The whole point of fantasy is to include a completely different world as a parallel to the real world.

And then we got this terrible piece of garbage, called \"Neverending Story III\". It's always a difficult task to make a sequel to a good and successful movie; so producing a third part is even more complicated. Still, there are some great Part IIIs, like Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (part 3 of the OT), Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (part 3 of the PT), Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade or Back to the Future III. They all succeed by staying true to the original movie's formula, having the same main actors, cleverly introducing new characters or expanding the storyline of the forerunners (and by having a big budget, by the way). Unfortunately, does neither of the things mentioned above. Because I don't want to say too much about this disgraceful sequel, only a small rundown of why it sucks so bad: 1. The setting was changed. The story now takes place in the real world, no longer in Fantasia. That's a good idea, but it simply doesn't work at all, mainly because of the interaction of the Fantasia-characters with the real world (what's with the Rock Biter singing \"Born to be Wild\"? Or a fantasy character mentioning Las Vegas? How do they know that stuff? Doesn't make sense at all. 2. The movie is unbelievably silly. I just say Rock Biter family...what a terrible scene. 3. The personality of some characters has changed. That's especially bad with the childlike Empress. She's no longer childlike, kind, smart, caring and lovable, but a snobby teenager. 4. The movie was made cooler, or at least it was supposed to be cooler, for example by introducing the (incredibly dumb) Nasties and the above mentioned \"Born to be Wild\" thing. 5. The actors are simply terrible, neither of them is convincing or even has potential (except for Jack Black). 6. The visual effects are truly horrible, even the first part looks way better. But that might be because of the rather low budget. Still, the way the fantasy characters are created and presented in this one is embarrassing, just look at Falcor or the Rock Biter (did he shrink since part 1?) 7. The most cruel thing: Atreyu is missing, for no apparent reason. So one of the most popular and beloved characters is simply wasted. Normally, you don't throw away interesting characters like him in any movie series. It's a crime he was missing. If you're a fan of the book and the first (or even the second) flick, then avoid this stinker at all costs. Simply watching it could make you cry, because it destroys it's forerunners legacy.

The rockbiter and family is a joke that's not funny when Rockbiter was such a prominent, relevant character with such depth before. New characters like Barky (tree, obvs) try to hard to be funny. The best new character was Slip (Jack Black) while he was in a cringy gang called The Nasties. The acting isn't bad, it's just awfully written with a awful plot that drags everything else down.",

I don't really give a crab what they say or if they like it or no because I like it and thats what matters to me. u know what to be honest i don't think it's a kid movie because if it would be s kid movie for example \"franklin\" no adults or teenagers would like it, and obviously they don't. Me and My whole family were upsest with that movie when we first saw it. We would watch it every single day and over and over again and never get tired of it.

I watched it since I was like 5 or 6 years old and I still watch it now sometimes. I'll never get tired of watching it. Now my little sisters watch it too and they love it.

Actually, Jack Black and the rest of the Nasties aren't too bad. If you just watch their parts and fast forward through all of Bastion and Nicole's little dramas, the movie becomes watchable. Sort of. So there's my advice. If you really feel the need to find out what happens to Bastion when he goes on to a cheesy B-movie career, fast forward through most of it and stop whenever the Nasties are around.

Whilst the first sequel may not have lived up to some expectations, it did at least contain that same sense of wonder and fantastical charm that enriched the original. This third entry abandons our awe in favor of gags and goofs. Bastian this time around is played by Jason James Richter of 'Free Willy' fame. His father has remarried and he has subsequently acquired a teenage step-sister. It's not long before Bastian and his extended family are caught up in Fantasia, his land of imagination. Particularly when a group of comical high school bullies, led by Jack Black, steal The NeverEnding Story book and create havoc in both Fantasia and our world. The creature design this time is by the Jim Henson workshop. Sadly, their renditions of the inhabitants of Fantasia and indeed their personalities are inconsistent with the previous entries. For example, Falkor is reduced from being a noble and brave luck-dragon to a whiny and cowardly puppy dog. And this is what hurts the film the most. To the younger viewer it will be a mildly amusing affair, but to those who have followed the film series, it will appear to be a complete deviation that will have you aching for the Fantasia of old.The actors all turn in good performances but you feel they would all be best served by a more earnest script that employed plot lines from Michael Ende's novel.

It was tolerable enough that I watched it to the end.Although the Empress in the first movie explained very clearly that Fantasia is made up of wishes and dreams, so the more wishes the better. Then they decided no, wishes are going to eat away at his memories. Hey producers! These movies are supposed to inspire kids to imagine and dream. There was a hidden meaning in the whole \"wish\" thing. Instead you make it so the next generation of kids think twice about wishing, dreaming, imagining. Besides, they stole the creatures from Krull.Now here comes #3. This one on the other hand actually angered me it was so bad.1) The father-son relationship was well done in the 2nd movie, now suddenly dad is clueless and married to an airhead? Since dad discovered the secrets of the book from movie #2, it would've been nice if they built on that. But no, he completely forgets everything that happened and is now in LaLa Land.2) Originally the fantasy-reality connection that allowed Bastian to appear in the story was simply a child's active imagination mixed with a few unexplained coincidences in the real world. But he never actually left the attic. Now Bastian can simply talk to the book and teleport like Star Trek? Seriously?3) Engywook and Urgl shrunk even more! Before they were about 3 feet tall, now they're not even 12 inches?4) Falkor #3 no longer tucks his legs in when flying, making for quite a sloppy looking show. It doesn't even look like Falkor. He has a Col. Sanders goatee now. He's supposed to be a \"Luck Dragon\" not a \"Luck Flying Dog\". I know he's a dragon that looks like a dog, but he's still a dragon, and should fly like one. At least Falkor #2 looked like #1 and flew like it too. #3 looks and flies more like Falkor's cousin from the trailer park sipping moonshine in between flights.5) The whole Rock Biter (now Rock Chewer apparently) scene should've been cut and burned and buried. This whole sequence by far doesn't even mesh with the rest of the film. If there was any seriousness in the film, this sequence takes it all away and turns it into a kid's Saturday morning TV show. You know those stories of people getting too drunk and waking up with a mysterious tattoo? This is what happens when the Director gets drunk. The kid's watching a cartoon in the wall? They have a Flintstone ATV? Singing \"Born to be Wild\"? I need a drink.6) To play the now-grown-up Empress they hired a UK actress who insists on pronouncing Fantasia (fan-tay-shuh) the UK way with an extra syllable (fan-tay-zee-ah). Now don't misunderstand me, I'm all UK myself and am proud of it. But I'm more proud of my theatrical experience and knowledge. And I know that if a significant word in the script (especially a name important to the plot) is pronounced a significant way by everyone involved, you DO NOT go on saying it your way just because you believe it's \"proper English\". That is, if you have any interest in having a lengthy acting career. You can tell by the way she puts emphasis on it several times at her first appearance that she does not care. These mistakes and her arrogance make the character seem like an unintelligent demanding snob. What happened to the sweet and compassionate Empress?7) The Bark Troll sees a tree being cut down and says \"talk about a chainsaw massacre\". This movie is intended for a very young audience. Yet they use a reference to a very graphic adult horror film. Obviously the Director doesn't know how children think. They will wonder \"what does that mean?\" if they don't already know, and ask around or look it up. And I'm sure half of those will be curious enough to want to watch it at such a young age. Even in 1994 it was easy enough to do some research, talk to the older kids, find out it's the name of a horror film, rent the movie albeit under-age (via naive parents or naive rental clerks), and then have nightmares for weeks.If there is one good thing to say about this movie, it's that Jack Black (early in his career) was very funny from beginning to end. But that is the ONLY thing. The rest of it is a film student's nightmare.",

Wasn't Rock Biter, a bigger giant in the first two movies?And why did a different movie company Miramax, release it instead of Warner Bro's who released the first two movies. This movie didn't capture the magic of the first two movies.",
