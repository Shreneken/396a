            "content": "Director and writer Lars von Trier's 1996 \"Breaking the Waves\" received much attention worldwide when initially released.  Commentary reflected the high degree of polarization this long, engrossing and deeply disturbing Indie film created.  I saw it when it first briefly hit Manhattan theaters and last night I watched the DVD release, reabsorbed in its intricacies.Emily Watson's portrayal as young Bess McNeill is the most powerful performance of a career still in the ascendancy.  Bess lives in a small Scottish village by the sea, away from any center of culture or heterogeneity.  She has no job and she appears to volunteer her services as a janitor at the church which her family attends. It is the dominating religious, social and - I suspect - political entity in the area.Bess has one friend, a woman who becomes increasingly important both to her and the story, nurse Dodo McNeill, widowed wife of Bess's brother. (Katrin Cartlidge, a truly gifted and beautiful actress, is Dodo.  A tragedy, she died in 2002 of pneumonia barely into her forties.)The movie begins with Bess asking, apparently, for permission to marry an \"outsider.\"  She receives, in church, grudging authorization to wed Jan, a worker on an off-shore oil rig (the always interesting Stellan Skarsgard). We're never told how she met him but the church scene immediately and succinctly conveys the fear and, indeed, near loathing the male religious oligarchs have of anyone entering their closed and tightly controlled community.Jan and Bess wed in a ceremony followed by a party where some of Jan's hard drinking work pals attend but hardly mingle with the lemonade-sipping locals (there's a very funny chug-a-lug competition that highlights the dividing lines neatly).Bess is not only a virgin, she's never seen a naked man before.  Her initiation into sex is rather a success and her love for Jan deepens as rapidly as her new found lust for vigorous and frequent love-making.Jan suffers a near fatal accident on the rig and is flown back to hospital. It doesn't take long for the doctors to determine he's permanently paralyzed from the neck down.  Dr. Richardson (Adrian Rawlins) becomes chief physician not only to Jan but to his disconsolate wife who prays for a miraculous recovery while remaining devoted to her husband.What happens next is the plot twist that has fascinated many and repelled quite a few.  Jan, knowing that physical intimacy with Bess is impossible, asks her - no, really implores her - to take on any number of lovers AND report back the details of her trysts.  After a hesitant and almost funny start, she complies.  As her sex life accelerates any humor evaporates.The results of the ongoing experiment in vicarious lovemaking for Jan and for Bess, sinking way beyond her depth, are disastrous.  She slowly elides into a twisted caricature of the personality envisioned by Jan.  Communal rejection is not far off.  And this in a community where membership in the church is the sole indicium of civic and personal legitimacy.Some critics and viewers described Bess as retarded or simple from the beginning.  I found her to be naive and inexperienced, the kind of sheltered person for whom marriage to a man of broad experience and unfettered sexuality is boundlessly liberating.  Bess's inevitable penance does not stem from any interior failing of her's. It's the \"game\" urged on by Jan that exposes her to the venomous wrath of religious fundamentalists whose innate need to condemn and consign to hell (literally and volubly) is beyond Jan's imagination.  Whether his desire that she engage in sexual escapades really reflected his belief that it would make him feel better or whether this was an evolving pathological caprice on his part (and both views have strong adherents here on IMDb and elsewhere), he did not foresee the resulting debacle.On several levels von Trier has mirrored, through powerful acting and awesome direction, that small, closed society whose fundamentalist interiority is a microcosm of the hatred that blind, non-humanistic religion often brings (it's easy to see the stern, unsmiling, dogma-obsessed church leader as a modern incarnation of the sixteenth century's John Knox of Edinburgh).Von Trier won't let Bess escape as her situation worsens. Dr. Richardson and Dodo first ask and then beg her to abandon her self-destructive and now publicly shocking behavior.  There is a sense of classical tragedy in the painful unfolding of Bess's mental and physical deterioration.  She can't curtail her conduct because of her absolute devotion to Jan and her community can't and won't understand or forgive her.The resolution is wrenching but also uplifting with the suggestion that Bess's acts reflect good in a pristine sense.  It's not meant to be realistic but to deliver, I felt, a needed moral lesson.\"Breaking the Waves\" isn't for everyone. It does showcase brilliant acting and direction in a fable that has some very uncompromising arguments about a religious dominance which only concerns itself with a believed afterlife, caring nothing about addressing the pains of living and administering to its sufferers compassionately.10/10",

I was ready to hit the eject button about 20 minutes into the movie. But I held in there and slowly was drawn in to their lives, their environment, and the ghastly tragedy that confronts them.  Lars von Trier is a very patient storyteller, as well as being an eccentric movie maker. In Breaking the Waves, he slowly, very slowly unfolds his drama. The problem is; you have to pay careful attention, and this can be difficult. Von Trier's style, with its hand-held camera, lack of artificial lighting, grainy photography, and lingering close-ups can try the patience. The movie is also long, clocking in at about 2\u00bd hours. But if you see it through, the final half hour will blow your mind, and you will have seen one of the best (and most emotionally powerful) movies of 1996, maybe even the whole decade.",

            "content": "It's a pity that for most people Lars von Trier's involvement with the Dogme group of film makers is the main thing they know about him. Wherever you stand on the Dogme issue (personally I'm all for it as long as they continue to make movies as great as 'Festen' and 'The Idiots'), his brief alliance with the group has overshadowed amazing work like 'Element Of Crime', 'Europa' and 'Breaking The Waves'. 'Breaking The Waves' was made before the Dogme manifesto was formulated, but it can be seen as a step in that direction, with its use of documentary techniques as opposed to the flamboyant and highly stylized approach of von Trier's earlier films. To me the ends justifies the means, and the bottom line is that this is an extraordinary and powerful movie, one of the greatest of the last ten years. The main reason it is so remarkable is because of the devastating performance of Emily Watson, one of the most impressive screen debuts in the history of film. Watson plays Bess McNeill, a naive and odd young woman living in a remote and deeply religious  Scottish community. She is so good in this movie she'll leave you speechless! Stellan Skarsgard, a most underrated actor in my opinion,('Insomnia', 'Ronin') plays Bess's husband and is also superb, and the supporting cast includes the late Katrin Cartlidge ('Naked') as Watson's sister-in-law, and von Trier regulars Jean-Marc Barr (almost unrecognizable from his leading role in 'Europa'), as one of Skarsgard's work buddies, and cult legend Udo Kier ('Flesh For Frankenstein', 'The Story Of O') in a cameo as a very nasty piece of work who Bess has the misfortune to encounter. The less you know about this movie the more powerful it will be, and even a jaded cynic like myself was surprised at how effective its spiritual theme was. To me 'Breaking The Waves' is a much better more than von Trier's better known 'Dancer In The Dark', and Watson's performance makes Bjork's look like that of an enthusiastic but not very talented amateur (which of course, is exactly what she is). Highly recommended.",

            "content": "This is the story about love. Everyday we experience this breathtaking emotion with both inanimate objects and with other souls. It is when we finally find true love that nothing else in the world seems worthy or good. We work as hard as we can to continue this warmth that we feel in our hearts when true love exists, and sometimes that means going to a level we never thought imaginable. That is the central theme of Lars von Trier's epic, Breaking the Waves. Love has no boundaries as we watch Bess do everything possible (and more) to keep the relationship with her husband together during the roughest of times. Emily Watson controls the character Bess giving her best performance ever. The emotion and serenity that is felt, not only behind the character of Bess, but also behind Watson's eyes is phenomenal. It is not often that Hollywood is able to capture this sort of raw emotion, but Watson pulled it off with incredible talent. Outside of Watson's character, there is the story. Lars von Trier does a spectacular job of continually building on the foundation that he has begun.Watson is his foundation, and Trier builds this amazing world around her. In this film, everything from talking to God to reverberating stories to her husband while he is in the hospital only helps build the story to even higher heights. I will be honest; I shed tears at the end of this film. It will pull at every heart muscle that you have and really make you look at your significant other and truly feel the power of love.This is a love story, but not like one we have seen in a very long time. I don't think we will see anything similar to this again. It will be hard for Hollywood to emulate such raw talent, groundbreaking direction, and life-changing story. Thank you Lars von Trier for your imagination and passion for love.Grade: ***** out of *****",

            "review_title": "Gritty sequel to Dreyer's \"Ordet\"",
            "content": "Lars von Trier's \"Breaking the Waves\" stars Emily Watson as Bess McNiell, a young woman who lives in a strict, Calvanist village. Bess spends her days working at a local church, talking to God and slipping in and out of various delusions. Because she has an unspecified mental illness, Bess also believes that she is a \"sinner\" who must constantly pay penance unto the Lord.One day Bess meets Jan, an offshore oil worker. The village doesn't welcome Jan, but Bess does. Eventually Bess and Jan get married, but Jan has an accident and is rendered paralysed. Blaming herself for Jan's injury, Bess sacrifices herself by giving her body to vicious sailors. She lets them rape and cut her flesh, an act of \"self-sacrifice\" which Bess believes will result in a \"miracle\" which heals Jan of his paralysis.The film climaxes with Bess stumbling into Jan's hospital room, her body bloody and torn. She hopes her husband has been miraculously cured. He has. Bess dies in the room next to his saved body.The local pastor believes Bess to be an \"unholy\" and \"sinful\" girl, and so he prepares a funeral in which she is to be consigned to hell. The night before the funeral, however, Jan steals Bess's body from the morgue and gives her a secret burial at sea. When her body hits the ocean, giant bells ring in the heavens above. The audience recalls an earlier scene in which it is explained that the local church forbid the use of bells.So what we have here is essentially a Christ allegory. The \"crazy Christian\" who is humble and meek, the film's seven chapters, the corrupt local church, the public stoning, the personal sacrifice, the miracle, the crucifixion, the grave robbing and resurrection, are all fairly well known stories in the New Testament.The film's message ultimately amounts to the same as Dreyer's \"Ordet\", a film which director Lars Von Trier cites as his favourite film of all time. \"Waves\" says only the innocent are able to have steadfast faith in God, a fact which will make them seem mad in the eyes of both unbelievers and those who hold dogmatically to tradition. Like Dreyer's film we also have a doctor who learns to put aside the rationality of science and blindly embrace faith. The film teaches us the power of sacrifice, faith, submission and personal suffering and says that physical love has healing, life giving powers.In other words, it's a bunch of Christian propaganda: shut up, be a child and do as told. In reality, Bess is caught between two patriarchal paradigms, the virgin and the whore. She is a victim, sacrificed on the altar of patriarchy by a sadistic husband and cruel God. On the plus side, the film goes further than \"Ordet\" in that it carefully examines the social conditions existing around Bess. It suggests - perhaps unintentionally - that women will continue to pay with their lives for the sins of their fathers, unless truly revolutionary social alterations and religious reformations are made.Unsurprisingly, Martin Scorsese cites \"Waves\" as one of his favourite films. Its blend of religion and sadism, as well as its false badge of \"realism\", aligns itself firmly with Scorsese's own world view. And where Scorsese's \"Raging Bull\" seems designed around the stations of the cross, \"Waves\" offers seven stylish chapter cards, each accompanied by a memorable song. These songs are themselves fairly symbolic, indirectly referencing Virgins, Holy Marys, unconditional love, crucification, and blind hope. The film's first song, \"All the Way from Memphis\", is used in a similar fashion by Scorsese in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\", whilst the rest of the song selections have a rock and roll feel which would feel right at home in Scorsese's filmography.But perhaps the most interesting thing about \"Breaking the Waves\" is its visual style. Von Trier uses hand held 8mm cameras and pretends to stick close to the principles of Dogme 95. The result is that the film has a superficially \"realistic\" and \"voyeuristic\" feel. Such a raw and gritty film caused quite a commotion when it was initially released, but this style has now been absorbed and digested by countless big budget Hollywood productions to the extent that \"Breaking the Waves\" has lost much of its bite. The gore, unflattering lighting, film grain and shaky camera now feel less like an attempt to uphold the rules of Dogme 95 than a manipulative aesthetic itself.And on another level, isn't it ironic that a film which tries so hard to fake reality, would be so obsessively concerned with attacking rationality? That a film which pretends to adhere to the principles of Dogme 95, would itself be about religious dogmas? Still, you want visceral drama, you get visceral drama. Emily Waton, like Jesus in Mel Gibson's \"Passion of Christ\", puts herself through hell to move your soul. Bless the poor girl.7/10 - Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves is the kind of film that makes me proud to be a film-goer and exceeds anything I could have possibly expected from the man who made Element of Crime. That film had some clever experimentation (and so does this one) but this film is the kind that's beauty and power echoes in your mind hours after you've watched it. This is a flabbergasting work of art that portrays a woman's quest to please God and does so with the complexity and emotional power of a Bergman film (not to mention the fact that the film portrays a woman's intense suffering in world sternly ruled by men with the power of a Dreyer film). If von Trier made nothing else of any merit for the rest of his career, if all he did was make marginally interesting film experiments, I wouldn't hesitate to call him a great filmmaker on the soul basis of this film. Anyway, you get the picture\u0085 The film stars Emily Watson as Bess, a shy and neurotic girl who is filled with joy to be with her new husband Jan (Stellan Skarsgard who is exceptional). When Jan is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in, he is in danger of losing his life. He convinces Bess to see other people and Bess wants nothing more than to make him happy and to prove to God that she loves him. After some disastrous complications, Bess is led to believe that she can please God and save Jan's life by having numerous sexual encounters with strangers in town. This sounds like a grungy tale, but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear. And Watson is delightful, frightening, and heartbreaking as a woman who will stop at nothing to please those around her. Her one-sided conversations with God (in which she looks up in the air submissively and pleas and then looks down with a deep voice of wrath and scolds) are both funny and sad, not to mention the fact that they reveal seemingly endless amounts of details about who she is. The film is made with a hand-held camera and a visually stunning solarized style. This style does not make the movie; it just adds richness to each scene in the way it gives each face such shadowy texture. In the end, von Trier seems to believe in God but does not believe in the churches that try to codify what he wants. All of this works because of von Trier's passionate desire to understand how one can please God under horrendous terms; the epilogue, that takes the already-great material to a new level and shows how inspired von Trier is, starts with a moment of sad irony and then leaps to the skies with an image that fills the most atheistic person with questions and the more religiously spiritual people with hope. Here is a film that reaches for the stars and makes it there.",

            "content": "Emotional power is one of the most difficult and complex aspects of film-making to succeed in. Very few films can manage to be emotionally destructive, while still retaining the viewer's concentration and dedication to the piece. Yet, Breaking the Waves is a film that holds more emotionally power that most films, it is not a film you will want to see again. One viewing is enough (at least for a long period of time). Bearing in mind, you will feel devastated by the film's self-destructive nature and after viewing such an unforgettable story of heart ache and sadness you will have etched into the back of your mind.Breaking the Waves is a complicated story; it is one that studies love, regret, guilt, madness and religion. Breaking the Waves is set in a small religious town deep in Scotland and tells the sorrowful story of the innocent Bess (Emily Watson) and her lover Jan (Stellan Skarsgaard). Jan becomes paralysed in a freak accident at the oil-rig he is working on and asks his estranged wife Bess to have sex with other men and then tell him what it was like to keep their relationship stable.Lars Von Trier, the founder of Dogme film-making creates a drama that remains in a league of its own. Though Breaking the Waves is not Dogme film-making (like The Idiots) it still has elements of Dogme film-making style littered around it. The film is separated into chapters, which work as wonderful mood and symbolic transitions. These sequences are a single shot focusing on something that is considerably impressive, with the added touch of a brilliantly chosen song to fit the mood. The film's general direction is one that feels like it has been shot with a hand-held style.The film studies many questionable elements of life, including topics such as death, terminal illness, spirituality, emotions and hypocrisy in religion. These are just a view of the talking points that crop up throughout the long running-time. The film asks the viewer questions and most importantly tests how much harrowing devastation you can handle. There is no denying just how pure Breaking the Waves is.Emma Watson gives a career defining performance with her pitiful role of a naive young woman, who just wants to be free from pain. The performance is very painful to watch because it is so unbearably realistic. You become apart of her journey and watch her emotions and sanity spiral out of control, even from the people who love her. Heartbreaking in every way.Breaking the Waves is a difficult film and one that is not for everyone, though I say it is a film which deserves the critical acclaim it gets.",

I've wanted to see \"Breaking the Waves\" in quite a while, and recently I finally had the chance. Now I can't say which one is better. What a heartbreaking experience. Emily Watson had one of the best film debuts ever, and this is probably the most accomplished female performance I've seen since Julianne Moore in \"The Hours\". Actually, if I had to list 3 favourite female performances now, I'd mention Watson, Moore and Isabelle Huppert in \"The Piano Teacher\". Lars von Trier has a special talent to direct women: just remember Nicole Kidman's and Bj\u00f6rk's remarkable performances in \"Dogville\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\", respectively.\"Breaking the Waves\" tells the story of the pure Bess McNeill (Watson) and her unconditional love for Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who is paralyzed after an accident at the oil-rig he works in. Then, Jan convinces Bess to have sex with other men and tell him the details of the sexual encounters, so he won't \"forget\" how to do it. Bess is determined to make Jan happy and to prove to God that she loves him, but she soon loses control of her actions. The storyline might sound absurd, but Von Trier isn't a joker and he takes us into a devastating journey. Katrin Cartlidge (1961-2002), an extremely gifted actress (\"Naked\", \"Before the Rain\", \"Claire Dolan\", \"Career Girls\", \"Topsy-Turvy\" and \"No Man's Land\") who died too young, delivers a captivating, discreet supporting performance as Dodo, Bess' loving sister-in-law.I'd say \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dogville\" are opposite masterpieces: \"Waves\" being about love and goodness, \"Dogville\" being about hatred and evil, among other things, of course (nothing's easy or simple in Von Trier's universe). Both films are extremely dark and hard to watch, but \"Waves\" shows that Von Trier has faith in mankind. His detractors like to label him as a cynical atheist, but \"Breaking the Waves\" definitely proved me the opposite. Von Trier made a poignant epic about the struggle of an innocent, good-hearted woman who wants to do what God wants her to do (or, at least, what she thinks He wants her to do) and make her husband happy - even if she has to sacrifice herself for that. It's a leap of faith both for Bess and the watcher, who's got to decide if he's ready for such an experience. I wasn't disappointed at all. 10 out of 10.",

Was she nuts?  Was she just a bit slow? Was she simply oppressed by the fanatical religious fervor of her town and family? I watched the whole thing with a skeptical eye.  Von Trier's dogmatic style of filming (with shaky hand-held cameras, lots of intimate close-ups and a gritty texture to the stock that actually makes it look like a film from the early 70's) irked me on some level, but then I loved the \"chapter breaks\" with the striking wide-screen vistas of scenic wonders accompanied by pop music (from the 70's).  It was all mildly interesting and a bit strange (which is always good), and when Beth made her huge \"sacrifice\" I didn't quite know what to make of it all, it all being so grim and emotionally draining.  And then, the end, one little scene reminded me that this was not supposed to be some gritty piece of character drama, but a work of art, and suddenly, I lit up at the sight and sound of the last scene and it all made sense, Beth made sense (in a surreal way), and it was all so wonderful and tragic and wholly satisfying.  Von Trier had given me a totally unique cinematic experience, and whether or not I \"liked\" the film had become moot. It had affected me like no other film before, and that is the highest remark any work or art could hope for.",

I easily class this work as one of the top films of the 1990s.  Director Lars von Trier is a true visionary, and the (largely hand-held) cinematography by Robby Muller perfectly defines the tone of the film -- in fact, the theatre where I saw Breaking the Waves posted a disclaimer that warned anyone who suffers from motion or sea-sickness to see the film at their own peril!",

It is surprising how gripping the film is, as it is difficult to watch, not just because of the subject matter, but also because of its style. Made by the conventions of Dogme '95, the film has many extreme close-ups, generally shaky camera-work and errors in continuity for editing and audio levels, all of which is supposed to amount to a film that looks and feels more realistic. With this film though, the quality of the acting and writing provide enough realism alone, and therefore the style serves no purpose other than to make the film more difficult to digest. It is an incredibly long film, and while this is not too much of a problem, the chapter markers are noticeably long without much reason either. Still, the film comes through despite its detracting bits. Watson, in her first film performance, is excellent, and Cartlidge provides great support. This is not an easy film to watch and like, but it is easy to admire what is done well in the film.",

Perhaps there is ultimately no difference.Emily Watson was luminous and altogether convincing, and the camerawork didn't bother me in the slightest. On the contrary, it suited the story immensely - as did the deliberately washed-out palette. A brilliant invocation of a time and place.However, the story left me feeling like I'd just watched someone kicking a puppy ... for several hours. I dislike the implication that such brutal and violent self-sacrifice can be justified by intense love, and to have this line wrapped up in a dewy religious shroud is a cop-out. It's like watching a documentary about the horrors of sideshow life - with plenty of explicit segments starring the freaks themselves.

            "content": "Although Lars von Trier's \"Breaking the Waves\" is undoubtedly one of the most impressive films of recent years, I have delayed commenting on it until now, as my feelings about it are far from clear.  Certainly it has an arresting quality that held me in a vice-like grip for nearly three hours - no mean achievement as generally once over the two-hour threshold one is looking for the scissors.  But, no, it has a mesmerising quality that reminds me of Dreyer's \"Ordet\" at times.  Both are set in remote communities and deal with religious concepts which, even for a semi-believer, remain difficult to comprehend; in the case of Dreyer the miracle of a resurrection and here the hint at something similar in a final scene I will not reveal. Both films have a supposedly mentally unstable central character, a young man who talks as Christ in \"Ordet\" while Bess, the young woman in \"Breaking the Waves\" talks to God who answers her in her own voice's deepest register. Bess falls in lave with Jan, an oil-rig worker and the early scenes chart their wedding.  When Jan has to return to the oil-rig the distraught Bess prays to God for his return, a prayer that is answered ironically when he returns paralysed from the neck down after an accident on the rig.  How Bess lives with this situation is the subject of the second and third hours of the film.  These have at times an almost unbearable intensity and at one point, where a group of         children taunt Bess, we are in deepest \"Mouchette\" country.  It is one of those very rare films where I feel the use of a hand-held camera to be completely justified as it gives extraordinarily emotional events a frenetic immediacy.  However by punctuating the action with chapter headings set against long held landscape stills, moments of an almost trance-like repose are achieved between each onslaught on the senses.  Whether the film is anything more than a quirky tale of sexual derangement bordering on morbidity is something that two viewings have left me uncertain about.  That I have compared it to Dreyer and Bresson is evidence that it is not a work to be ignored, but at the moment I have a gut reaction that there is more than a hint of sensationalism here that somewhat diminishes its artistic integrity when set beside the work of the earlier masters.",

She's saddled with a degrading role, asked to play a simpleton who honors her crippled husband's wish to have sex with other men and tell him all about it, an arrangement that spins out of control until she is ultimately gang raped and beaten to death even as her husband regains the use of his legs. Had the husband remained crippled, the film, though still pointless, might at least have been a sad study in one woman's foolish devotion to a higher power; but instead, it suggests that her sacrifice was entirely worth it -- her husband walks, and a horrible ending finds the bells of heaven ringing merrily as she ascends to her God.What drek. Lars von Trier is the worst kind of director, the kind that thinks it's his job to incite and provoke his audience, and that movies must be unendurable if they are to say anything that matters. What's most unendurable about this literally sickening movie is the hand-held camera work that not for one minute sits still. Von Trier would no doubt call me a Philistine, but he can kiss my ass and give me my money back.Grade: F",

CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON so invests its characters with these traits, that I thought I would never see another film to rival it in this respect. I was sadly mistaken.Neither Emily Watson or Stellan Skarsgard are as conventionally attractive as the kind of actors you would find in a big budget Hollywood production. Yet in their love scenes as Jan and Bess, I believe we get our very first glimpse on film of what sex between two people is meant to be as the Man Upstairs intended; not something dirty or vile or wanton, or anything as icily clinical as the conditions prescribed by Mother Church, but as a gift to us to be enjoyed, and therefore in turn the greatest gift that any one person can give to another as a sign of love and affection. That alone makes Skarsgard and Watson two of the sexiest, most passionate actors ever to make love on screen; they invest that much into Jan and Bess. I very nearly cried when Bess tells Jan in the throes of passion \"Thank you.\" So deep, tender and uncalculating is her love for him, that he can't help but return it. Few of us will ever know a love of that capacity or intensity in our lifetimes.Which is what makes this film's conceit easier to accept, and that much harder to bear. In these hard and cynical times, it would be easy to dismiss Bess as a feeble-minded idiot and have done with it. Had director Von Trier seen her story in that way, this would've been a pretty short film.But when our love for another and our faith is all we have, no matter how misguided it is, no one has the right to question or debunk it, no matter how well-meaning they are. I don't think that Bess' fate could've been altered or avoided no matter how her husband's doctor, her mother, or her sister-in-law Dodo had tried to approach the situation. Her love for Jan and her faith in God are what simultaneously nourished, sustained, uplifted and destroyed her. At the end, she was afraid that maybe she had made a mistake investing herself in making the ultimate sacrifice, and maybe that's what Von Trier was trying to say with that ending, which I'm sure turned off a lot of viewers. If the sacrifices you make are in quest of such love and spirituality, then you can never be wrong.That's a heady message, and a dangerous one if it is taken out of context. But for those who would condemn this film, I can only say this: you're not paying attention. BREAKING THE WAVES is a film about a woman fallen into promiscuity, the same way that BOOGIE NIGHTS is about a bunch of sleazy pornographers. If you're only looking at the surface, you shouldn't be questioning the content, but your own lack of vision.",

I had to force myself to watch it, hoping that somehow something redeeming would transpire. Two and one half hours later I can say that it did not. I wish I could say that this was a great work of art, but it is not. It is a sad, very sad commentary on the madness of human beings, a twentieth century 'tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.' Particularly depressing were the church fathers in their beards and their stupidity. And be forewarned, the sexuality is degrading, and the very essence of human love is willfully and repeatedly perverted.In making this movie, Director Lars von Trier no doubt sought a kinship with the tragedies of Shakespeare and the Greeks in which the fates destroy the protagonist because of a so-called 'fatal flaw,' a flaw the protagonist cannot help. Bess's fatal flaw was her childlike nature twisted by circumstance. In the great tragedies the essential purpose is to bring the audience, through its involvement and its identification with the protagonist, to a catharsis, a catharsis that cleanses the emotions and allows us to see the world as it really is, free of self-delusion. But Von Trier's bizarre and pathetic ending with those ridiculous bells in the sky was closer to bathos than anything else, and steered us not toward catharsis but into a kind of emotional limbo where not even emptiness is felt.",

From almost excessive visual stylization and remoteness, he uses an approach that is disturbingly documentary-like, heavily reliant on improvisation and incredibly intimate for the first time.Breaking the Waves is the story of simple-minded, good-hearted and slightly bonkers Bess McNee (Emily Watson in her first role!) of a secular Scottish community. She falls for a stranger from an offshore oil rig (Jan, played with consummate charm and tenderness by Stellan Skarsgard) who's long absences torture her. Eventually, he returns, paralyzed and, wanting Bess to live happily, convinces her to take lovers, telling her it will cure him while hoping for her to find someone else. Things (mainly Bess's mental state) go quite horribly wrong from that point on..The story of itself is ripe with melodrama and would strain the credulity of even the most naive of viewers if done conventionally. Such is not the case however and Von Trier turns a horrid tale into something intimate, real, tender and heartbreaking thanks to a bare-bones approach that puts all the more emphasis on an excellent cast (especially the late Katrin Cartlidge as Bess's widowed stepsister Dodo). The witty musical interludes that serve as chapter marks to the story only serve to further put you under the spell.Though the film is excellent on its own, it is part of a thematic trilogy (along with the dogma effort \"The Idiots\" and the astounding \"Dancer in the Dark\"). The main point is that Von Trier keeps toppling rules and barriers. Good. That means there's more to look forward to...",

            "content": "Although Breaking the Waves is interesting in many aspects, like the beautiful cinematography by Robby M\u00fcller (Paris, Texas), it is the story that has the most staying power. Von Trier's movies have a tendency to watch like literature and the division in chapters presents the first comparison. The static shots with their slowly changing picture as introduction to each chapter foreshadow the story in a nutshell, for example the large village shot against the background of the small boat Bess uses to make her sacrifice, or the changing of the light in the flow of the river indicating a passing.Set in a close strongly religious community it tells many stories: The most important is the destruction of an individual by that community that use the Bible to maintain control over its inhabitants. The ultimate punishment of abandonment is used to spread fear. One of the best scenes is at the wedding party: One of Jan's friends empties his glass in one, one of the elders does the same, Jan's friend breaks a plastic glass, the elder responds by breaking his glass resulting in a bleeding hand; this scene already stating the length the elders will go to maintain their power over the community. As Bess later returns to the church for consolation, she is only rejected by even her own parents.It all watches like a Greek tragedy with biblical proportions: Bess has to make the ultimate sacrifice, become a prostitute and die for it, to rescue her husband Jan from his death. As Bess is the only true believer in the movie, only her prayers are answered. Note that none of the elders or the sailors on the boat Bess visits has proper names. And the story has more angles: A feminist one, as the community is lead by men that disallow women to speak. And a deep distrust for the medical practice, more obvious in Von Trier's Riget / The Kingdom (a must-see by the way), as Dr. Richardson only adds to the misery. I found the end shot somewhat redundant and naive; it is not the kind of shot present in Solyaris for example that questions the whole movie.Von Trier is able to direct actresses in a way that their performance sticks to you weeks after you have seen the movie, here with Emily Watson. There is a parallel between the sacrifices Bess has to make for Jan and the sacrifices Von Trier demands from Emily Watson exposing her bare essentials and personality in front of the camera.Breaking the Waves is a slow and overlong movie: It doesn't need 2 \u00bd hours to tell its story. But it still makes an overwhelming impression by acting and story.",

            "content": "Lars von Trier is a director whose name I've heard almost incessantly through the years but whose work I've just now arrived at. After seeing this film, I'm not what you'd call encouraged. All I knew beforehand is that it contained some minor detail on offshore drilling (something of a personal interest) and featured Emily Watson, an actress I much admire. Both turned out to be the highpoints of a film that is overlong, all pretension, and no profundity.Most audiences know there are appreciable subtleties when it comes to performances, framing by the camera, and the editing. They know some directors can deliver a cogent message from only these three devices instead of relying on insistent music cues or excessive dialogue. Most audiences prefer this method because it seems less cloying, more sophisticated. And it's a skill von Trier utilizes. There is music here but only during pointless title cards that break the narrative into segments. There may have been background music in the wedding that opens the film, but I'd have to take another look to be sure. The story's delivery, however, depends almost entirely upon Watson: what she does, what she says or doesn't say, how she inflects.Her character's name is Bess, and an alert viewer is aware that this woman is seriously mentally ill. She has been oppressed all her life, by her parents and by their community, all of them beholden to the Calvinist church. She talks to God a lot, a one-sided conversation though she goes a step further than is usual in the movies, by composing His responses and projecting aloud His contralto voice. I applaud Watson for how successfully she imparts the damaged psyche of this woman. She conveys total disintegration without self-conscious expressions or gestures that would have distanced the actress from her character. Another actress may have been compelled to do that, to play against the blunt harshness of the material.But the other characters are far less developed. Their existence is kept at the rote level of the screenplay, to provide various foils for Bess's brainsickness. Okay, but to what end? First there is her husband, Jan, a roughneck who suffers his own mental damage after an accident on an oil rig leaves him paralyzed. Consequently, he implores his wife to sleep with other men and tell him about it afterward. It will aid his recovery. This request understandably mortifies her, even after she relents. Then there's the doctor and nurse (the latter is an in-law) who take care of Jan. Both of them try to talk sense into Bess, but something in their manners suggest not concern so much as the deluded ramblings of clinical hypocrites, people who are as compromised in their own way. The essential conflict in their relationship with Bess is that they just don't get her (i.e. the value of her faith). All she wants is to help her husband. She is na\u00efve and emotionally fractured, but her intentions are inherently good. That's all that matters in the end.Thanks in part to naturalistic camera-work by Robbie Muller, and the way it lingers on the seedy details of this frigid Scottish country\u2014how it connotes a \"slice of life\" quality\u2014von Trier does a skillful job of keeping us off-balance for much of the film's first half. We think we're in an objective, more or less realistic, drama and only gradually clued in as to the simple-minded parable he's building towards.Sure, you can argue for the absence of overt moralizing, that it's all relative, etc. But look again: there is a definite objective. Everything is posed. It is all in the performances, in the close-ups of Watson. What von Trier has done is to communicate a message almost exclusively through his performers and that message is reprehensible. The vagueness which continues to permeate the story till near its conclusion is, not the ambiguity of life, but a coy obfuscation by the storyteller. I was constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. When it finally happens, it doesn't just drop\u2014it plummets and cracks the ground.In the final shot, high above the rig platform, when heaven's bells begin to ring for Bess's \"sacrifice,\" my stomach turned. Few images are as hokey. What a downer, also, to celebrate the self-destruction of a young woman whose death resulted from the oppression she suffered; that denied her the exercise of mental faculties she needed in order to understand and cope with life. Yes, that is something to celebrate. To look upon Bess with sympathy and reflect on her end with regret for her malady is not good enough. For von Trier, it merits celebration. That tells me something rather sordid about him, and it's more disturbing than any of the film's merely prurient aspects.I don't think I'll be going on any more adventures with this guy. Not anytime soon.Rating: 1 (out of 4)",

            "content": "One of the most idiotic films of all time. BTW is the mega-turd that started the 90s hysteria for everything even vaguely LarsvonTrieresque. The European movie landscape, already heavily smeared and infested by petentious, self-delusional, self-indulgent, pointless, vapid, and narcissistic European movie critics and film-makers, had accepted into its \"elite\" ranks yet another left-wing charlatan, posing as an \"artist\" who knows exactly what he's talking about.This is undoubtedly one of the most insipid dramas/love stories ever made. It's too stupid for words, but I'll give it a try. This is a unique chance for words to try to prove to me that they CAN live up to the ultimate challenge by describing an atrocity of this magnitude.The very idea that Skarsgard would suggest to Hysteria (Watson) that she live out sexual adventures for her own good (while pretending that it's for his own, as well) can only come from the mind of a hateful lunatic.The fact that Hysteria is doing everything in this movie as a sacrifice to God can only come from the mind of a religious lunatic who adores God, but makes movies that make him look like a Satanist. God is portrayed here as a merciless tyrant, a sadist, a gleeful torturer of innocent people, and a Very Grumpy Being bent on wrecking people's lives for no apparent reason at all.This becomes apparent through Hysteria's conversations with God (which at first seem just schizophrenic), and those hilarious bells at the end of the movie - which signify God's approval of all the events that transpired. (Or maybe the bells were God's way of saying \"When is this damn piece of crap going to finally end?!\") The only conclusion left for me from the laughable end-of-movie-bells f**k-up: Trier's God is very happy that he made Hysteria go through Hell and then die a violent death, so that her hubby can walk again. Of course, never mind the fact that it was Trier's God in the first place who intentionally crippled Skarsgard just to annoy Hysteria and \"punish\" her for being in love with him so much that she wanted him to come back to her.Hence we also have to conclude: Trier's God was unhappy with Hysteria's deeply committed love towards Skarsgard, so when she prayed for his return he decided to \"punish\" her for being in love! We further conclude: Trier's God is deeply offended by love between a man and a woman, and \"rewards\" Hysteria's prayer to Him that her hubby return - by ruining her life and driving her to suicide. And then: bells, bells, oh them sweet-sounding bells! Hallelujah! Trier must be deranged, and his capacity for logical thinking severely damaged (IF it ever existed in the first place). That much is certain.Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie \u2013 let alone finds it touching - is without a grain of a doubt a total\u0085 well, you can guess what comes here. Those people who believe in God and still like the movie and aren't offended by it: they are the biggest\u0085 you-know-whats\u0085 of them all.Trier has a very confused mind and he makes movies for other confused minds. It's as simple as that. How fitting that his next movie was \"The Idiots\", an ultra-dull affair lacking both intelligence and wit. Worse yet, he is an untalented film-maker. BTW has an awful, ugly look: a combination of brown and yellow; if Trier wanted the film to look like diarrhoea \u2013 well, he certainly succeeded in that. The hand-held camera, which is nearly always a pathetic and unoriginal attempt at creating \"heavy-handed artistic realism\", swings left and right, back and forth, up and down, as though it were held by one of Trier's drunken Danish sailor characters. Very annoying. I got dizzy, quite frankly, watch this piece of \"art\".Emily Watson is utterly annoying, over-the-top, and makes grimaces that have to be seen to be believed. Jim Kerrey must be dying of envy. Her over-acting is out of control; it makes her seem beyond insane. She comes off as a drugged alien hiding in the body of an overrated British actress. I will definitely have to avoid her other movies. I just can't get that dumb face out of my head...Other silly details: 1) when Skarsgard's friend sees the bells in the sky, he first gets Skarsgard to look at the radar before showing them to him: very, very stupid.2) The town's elders (priests) gather on Hysteria's funeral to express their desires that she burn in Hell! Now, in what Western 20th-century religion does a priest go to a funeral to send the dead person to Hell?! Outrageously stupid. There are far nore intelligent and more subtle ways for Trier to display his hatred(?) for clergy and/or organized religion.There is plenty more nonsense, but, frankly, my mind has probably sub-consciously blocked out half of the crap in order to protect itself from permanent damage, so if you want a complete list of the ridiculous goings-on in this film, find a more detailed review, or \u2013 if you dare \u2013 watch it yourself.This moronic little film certainly didn't break any waves, but for unfathomable reasons it made some, especially among many uncritical viewers and self-loathing critics.Lars didn't tire of utilising his \"pointless martyrdom\" theme, hence \"Dancer In The Dark\", which is possibly even dumber.",

His nihilist story with the destruction of moral and religious values has a surprising conclusion with redemption to love and spirit that has no boundary and prevails. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katrin Cartlidge complete the lead cast with magnificent performances.The music score is another plus of this movie. The introduction of each chapter uses a classic from the 70's, with \"All the Way From Memphis\"; \"Blowing in the Wind\"; \"Pipe Major Donald Maclean\"; \"In a Broken Dream\"; \"Cross Eyed Mary\"; \"I Did What I Did for Maria\"; \"Virginia Plain\"; \"Whiter Shade of Pale\"; \"Hot Love\"; \"Suzanne\"; \"Love Lies Bleeding\"; \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\"; \"Whisky In the Jam\"; \"Child in Time\"; \"Your Song\"; \"Siciliana\"; \"Gay Gordons\"; \"Scotland the Brave\"; \"Barren Rock of Aden\"; \"Happy Landing\".I do not like to write extensive reviews but Lars von Trier usually shakes my emotions and in the end I write more than I wished.

A conceived sense of balance between the supernatural and the real even between the dramatic and the pathetic, as we follow Bess travel further and further away from what we call reality.Emily Watson makes it her own movie with her ability to express emotions in her facial expressions and the confidential looks she gives straight at us, we do not lose the illusion, as others usually say, but are drawn even deeper into Bess's world of thought. Skarsg\u00e5rd's and Cartlidge's role is a necessary catalyst, and does it so very well.",

If the behavior were cute or amusing that would be one thing, but this behavior is pathetic, destructive, nonsensical.  Like her church and family, it is hard for me to have sympathy for her.  Supporting characters beg her to stop, to no avail.  Too many elements are over-the-top, or more accurately, out-of-order (as the brits say).  The intensity of Bess's love for her husband, her naivet\u00e9, the rigid severity of the church,  the strictness of her parents, the madness of her injured husband.  It comes off as incongruous and contrived.  I think the story seemed great when read as a script, less so when viewed as a film.  All the flaws become visible.  The musical chapter markers add nothing.  Hint to aspiring filmmakers: don't do that.",

She suffered for her beliefs at the hands of the sadistic sailors and eventually died for the sake of love, just as Christ did at the hands of the Romans and scheming Pharissees.

It gave a sort of intimacy and excitement to the movie.  The editing too left no dull moments.I liked Jan's workmates, a rowdy bunch of fellows, full of fun in the changerooms  Their childlike teasing contrasted well with the awful tragedy that was about to unfoldBess and Jan make a strange contract when Jan ceases to be able to function as a virile man.  The arrangement is as preposterous as the outcome, but it is made unselfishly in consideration for each other.The acting is superb  under the direction of a great director.

            "content": "***WARNING*** This review may contain plot spoilersIt's probably a case of one man's food being another man's poison, but there was a distinct part in the film where I felt my all my interest and involvement in it completely snapping off, where I thought, despite its concerted attempt to be a palpably credible, sensitive emotional document, it came across as a shallow and exploitative piece. Unfortunately this was the main turning point of the film's narrative. This offbeat character drama is divided into several titled chapters based on what the director feels is the dominating event/theme of the chapter. The plot centers on Bess (Emily Watson), a girl who comes of a suffocatingly closed and ascetic coastal community that frowns upon all worldly attachments including mundane emotional ties, believing in complete surrender to a stern uncompromising God. Bess is intensely high-strung and child-like, the product of innate psychological disorder and an abnormally religious upbringing where being 'good' in the eyes of God is the sole raison d'\u00eatre. She is shown indulging in regular conversation with divinity where she supplies voices for herself and 'God'. Life takes a significant turn when she marries Jan (Stellan Skarsgard, unrecognizable from his turn as the persecuted conductor in Szabo's 'Taking Sides' which I have talked about previously), an off-shore oil-rig worker and ardent young husband. Bess believes the fruits of marital pleasure to be God's reward for her being 'good' and even sighs thanks to the Lord in her moment of carnal bliss. She is intensely attached to Jan's physical presence and grows alarmingly distraught when he leaves for his extended work schedules on the oilrig. Bess fervently prays to her God to send Jan back early. Jan does arrive early.but as the victim of a terrible accident that has left him almost completely paralyzed from neck down. Bess is stricken with sorrow and consuming guilt and watches obsessively over Jan. Jan, on the other hand, is caught up with the idea that without going through the act of making love to Bess, he will surely die. He wants Bess to sleep with other people and relate her experience as a means of reliving their passionate marital life. And this is where the film lost me. It's not because the idea came as a shocking surprise because I'd heard about the film's premise. It's not because the film dips into pornography; no, every effort is taken to maintain a realistic, non-titillating, even sordid touch in the scenes of Bess's misguided promiscuity. It's just that the entire idea seems to me presented in such a pat manner as to suggest that everything in the film up to that point was just filled in to reach that turn. Nothing in Jan's character till then indicates that he would have any such predilection and even the vague references as to how his injures and prolonged exposure to medicinal drugs would affect his mind seem very ham-handed. From the turn the narrative took from this point on, despite what goodness the film may have possessed in terms of specific acting and directorial touches, I could not shake off the idea of it being a cheesy melodramatic and ultimately exploitative flick. That's just my opinion and I respect the view of those who would disagree on this issue Trier aims to achieve a grainy, off-color documentary style look for his film and it works quite fine although I could have done with less of the jerky hand-held camera movements. Each chapter in the film is heralded by a post-card coastal scene accompanied a track from the classic rock era (My ignorant self could only specifically identify 'Blowing in the Wind', 'Cross-Eyed Mary' and 'Child in Time', I'm sure others would do better). The film's leading light Emily Watson does a sincere and often affecting turn as Bess, bringing across the pathological devotion to her husband, which leads her to acts of perversion and ultimate tragedy. I wish the film had been more fully deserving of her efforts.",

In it, actress Emily Watson portrays Bess McNeil, a woman who's slavish devotion to a near comatose husband exposes her to shame and ridicule when she attempts to honor his wish that she see other men and report back to him on her sexual escapades. Though at one point, husband Jan (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) rethinks his idea and writes a conflicted note stating \"Let me die. I'm evil in head\". That would have been enough, one would think, to deter Bess from proceeding with her destructive behavior. At a certain point, one must come to grips with the idea that perhaps the simple minded Bess actually does suffer from some form of mental illness to invite the seamy and destructive relationships she encounters. Why else return to the same ship to encounter a pair of thugs who violated her once before?Another reviewer for the film here on IMDb writes, \"This sounds like a grungy tale, but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear.\" Well excuse me, but that's exactly how I felt about the picture, so you'll have to leave me out of the foregoing generalization. Personally, if one's own perverse definition of love and how it can lead to destructive behaviors is your thing, then have at it, but this film does nothing for me, demonstrating once again that von Trier's film making appeals to a segment of film goers that don't mind immersing themselves in sordid and pointless dramas. If there's one thing about the picture that's worth mentioning on a positive note, it would actually be Emily Watson's role in the story, as she arcs her character through a complex set of emotions which leaves the patient viewer drained and dispirited. If that was von Trier's objective, then I guess he succeeded. And by the way, the near comatose husband, who's doctors insisted he would never walk again, closes out the picture hobbling around on crutches, hearing imaginary bells that aren't really there. Best not try to explain it.",

I tell you, you have not seen a film quite like this.Emily Watson is astounding as Bess, the young girl who we are gradually introduced to and slowly come to realise is a danger to herself and those she loves because of her illness. Sound support comes from Stellan Skarsgard as Emily's bridegroom, Jan.

But it received such high ratings from other viewers that I feel it's my duty to offer a contrary opinion.The story evolves around a young girl, Bess, who lives in a small Scottish village along the coast.  The story unfolds as she's getting married to Jan, a worker on one of the drilling platforms in the North Sea.   Emily Watson (\"Angela's Ashes\") plays Bess, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Capt. Tupolev in \"Hunt for Red October\") plays Jan.  When we first encounter Bess, the impression is that she's a simple country girl.  It's obvious Jan is the first man in her life other than her father. But during a conversation with Jan, her sister reveals that there's something wrong in the head with Bess.  We see Bess acting like a five year old when Jan has to return to work, and there are scenes of her praying, with her speaking God's lines in one voice and hers in another.Bess is so desperate to have Jan stay at home that she prays for him to return.  Right after that, there's a terrible accident on the drilling rig and Jan is basically rendered a vegetable due to injuries to his head and spinal chord.  That's where I turned the VCR off.I knew from the plot outline on the Imdb page that the film was about Bess having sex with other men in order for her husband to live vicariously through the act, but frankly, I didn't really care at that point.  A story has to have sympathetic characters in order for the viewer to remain interested, and there were none in this film.The relationship between Jan and Bess was never developed.  We first see them at the wedding and for bits here and there on their honeymoon, but the reasons for the attraction are never explained.  She's so simpleminded, Jan could be a puppy dog for all it matters.  Up to that point, you never really see much character to Jan either - he's basically just a regular guy working on an oil rig.So, I just didn't see much point in continuing.  If the relationship between the two was so important, why was it given such short shrift prior to the crisis in their lives?  Another factor was the annoying portrayal of Bess.  I thought it was a bit cruel for this simpleminded girl to be shown as essentially a crazy woman who speaks to and for God.  Emily Watson does an excellent job of acting here (maybe too good, much as Ralph Fiennes annoyed me in \"Spider\"), but I just couldn't stand to watch her any longer.If this sort of plot interests you, then by all means watch the film.  The acting is pretty decent, at least the two main leads, but be forewarned, the cinematography is from the school of herky jerky camera work.  All in all, I just couldn't sit there another hour.",

The actors have some substance to work with in this film and Emily does a wonderful job of doing so. However, the film is still highly contrived and unbelievable on pretty much every level, and is followed by a horrific ending which is so Hollywood-esquire in its dullness and predictability that it does ruin the film to a great extent. Even strangely contrived experiences in the world are rarely as dull as what Lars van Trier desires us to see. Why does he want to show us life so dull and unimaginative? That's not a method of film-making. It's not a vision of life. Just a tired filmmaker who can't think of much else to say over and over again.",

Cartlidge is also quite good as Watson's supportive sister-in-law.

The film at times induces motion sickness as von Trier bandies about the unstable camera. This annoying technique combined with the nearly three-hour length makes this almost unwatchable.",

            "content": "Sometimes a lot can be said in the story of one character, set in tragic and unfortunate circumstances. For in this case Bess, played by an unforgettably moving Emily Watson, is that character, a woman who prays everyday, and is married to a kind oil-rigger, Jan, played by an equally good Stellan Sarsgaard. She loves him unconditionally, and is perhaps a little too attached: like a child she pouts and gets a little more than upset over his leaving back to work on the rig. But he's gone, and she tries to deal, until he gets in an accident with a pipe hitting him. He's paralyzed, and there's little hope he will walk again, or do anything again. Bess still loves Jan, and will do anything for him... which, as it turns out, extends to something unconscionable, which is to sleep with other men so he can somehow have a connection with her.Makes little sense, and Jan is quite possibly mad himself. But Bess has no real firm faculty of how to choose things for herself, or choose what is really common sense. The unfortunate tragedy, underlying a lot of what happens to her and to the town's reaction to her, is her religious upbringing influences her more than anything. It may be a harsh point made by Lars von Trier, but it's an effective one: she's been inundated with fervent religion since she was a child, and now as an adult, following other tragedy (she lost a sibling years before), she's just a little 'off'. Bess says at one point, flat-out, that she's stupid, but it's all too easy an out. I think von Trier's point is that she would be perfectly capable of herself in choosing what to do in light of Jan's own tragedy. Instead, she kneels in a church or elsewhere, like Danny with 'Tony' in The Shining, talking in one innocent voice and then another that is darker, harsher, an unforgiving God inside her head.The sickness is pervasive, is what Breaking the Waves means to tell us, but this is not spelled out in big letters. It's something that a viewer can come to him/herself. And, oddly enough despite von Trier's own feelings on religion, watching the film I get the sense that believers won't mind. In fact, there's something of a spiritual nature going on in the picture, that could be read as being, ultimately, uplifting amid the dread and further tragedy that befalls Bess. It's like the director has taken his main influence here, Carl Dreyer, and infused him into a modern cinema that is urgent and alive, set in the 1970's with the occasional rock song coming in, and a hand-held camera marking it akin to a Cassavetes picture from the period. But whatever the influence, it's this director all the way, every painstaking minute and carefully composed, frantic-emotional shot.It's a startling film because of its subject matter, putting a whole new urgency and matter into a relationship drama and infidelity crisis (not to mention that of what is supposedly \"wrong\" in the mind), and how strong the performances are. I might have teared up a few times during the film if only due to Watson's immersion into Bess. She is Bess, after a short while, full of her liveliness and worry, her common and uncommon need to cry and pout, her determination to love at whatever cost. She's sympathetic, despite everything, since she's so frighteningly human and recognizable in her vulnerability, an innocent figure cast in the society of a frowning church and public who witnesses her decline to \"service\" for her husband without barely lifting a finger. And not for a moment did I not believe in Bess because I believed in Watson, and how far she would be willing to go in von Trier's text. Sarsgaard does similar work, though is not as present since he's in a full-body cast (still, very subtle, great work, just in the face and voice).It's certainly not an easy film to take in - it's about as sunny as a 'Silence-of-God' period Bergman, and its conclusion leaves only the slightest of bittersweet resolution - but it's power to wrap a viewer in its protagonist's plight is extraordinary. It reveals von Trier, more than any other of his films really, as a serious artist concerned with the fragility of the human condition, its power to corrupt and its delicacy at being both decent (the doctor) and twisted (Udo Kier's bit part). I almost wasn't prepared for how dark and disturbing the film got, but every moment I felt I was in good hands with its maker. I haven't always felt that way with his work, but this is definitely an exception. A+",

            "content": "Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves tells the story of Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), a young Scottish woman burdened by psychological issues and the judgments of a frigid, Calvinist community that clings to the traditional teachings of the church. By traditional, I mean classic gender roles and little to no expressive freedoms outside the home can be enjoyed and embraced by females. Bess, like most women in the village, marries young, to an oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), an atheist who provides Bess with the kind of warmth and acceptance she's not used to, not even from her own family. Bess's relationship with Jan is one of the most significant relationships she has in life, tied only with God, who she prays to each day and converses with Him using her own voice. More on that later.When Jan takes a job out of town, Bess becomes incredibly lonely, one day praying for Jan to come home. Following a serious, nearly-fatal accident at an oil site that leaves Jan paralyzed, Bess curses herself for being \"selfish\" and wishing for Jan to return home. Because of this, she submits herself to the mercy of Jan, who instructs her to go out in the world and seek the highest form of human pleasure, sexual intercourse, for he feels like a failure of a man for never being able to provide her with such sensations and feelings ever again. The film follows Bess's sexual awakening, as she's caught between the cold shoulders of her family and her village along with the desire to please Jan and adhere to the teachings and expectations of her almighty creator.Von Trier illustrates from the beginning that Bess carries the crippling weight of harsh judgment on her shoulders from numerous different individuals, and downplays the idea of mental illness in favor of showing the repercussions of such pressure. If you were living in a traditional village, already a minority being a female, limited in your rights as a human being, felt ostracized and unloved by your family, harshly criticized no matter what choice you made, and the only person you were able to unconditionally love who loved you back sat on the teetering edge of death and lackluster quality of life, I think you'd be hardpressed not to have a mental breakdown. Von Trier illustrates the Bess character as someone not easily written off as a whiny, insecure twit nor somebody crippled by a mental illness, but somebody tired and worn, and who will only grow to be more exhausted as time goes on.Her conversations with God are the most interesting because, as I stated before, she acts as God responding to her prayers and requests. Her comments as God reflect an assumed bitterness about the Almighty's general attitude towards her and her decisions that seems to more or less be made up of the general opinion of her in her village. This explicitly shows that she has predicated her idea about God's opinion of her thanks to the false, perverted teachings of her Calvinist church and the rejection of her family. It's an ugly way to see life, but who could blame her for not bearing even a shred of confidence after all that she has been through in life? Breaking the Waves follows Bess closely for all one-hundred and fifty-nine minutes, rarely including a scene without her and rarely losing sight of her as a character. Metaphorical interpretation of the character could potentially see her as Jesus Christ himself, somebody well-worn with the responsibility of providing solace (or \"saving\" in a grandiose sense) to the one she loves, and putting up with a great deal of mistreatment amongst her peers, especially as she turns to prostitution. A key parallel between Bess's story and the life of Christ is when Bess is walking her bicycle through her village, in torn leggings, looking disheveled and moments from collapse, as young children walk behind her, throwing rocks at her and hurling insults. This scene directly mimics widespread interpretation of the Romans taunting Christ as he carried his cross to his death, and in this particular scene, Bess is made so powerless and feeble that the children that tail her are seen as more powerful and worthy than her.The film is shot in the 1990's style known as \"Dogma 95\" which was characterized by immediacy, naturalism, and the lack of artistic credit. The film is shot with a hand-held camera, using natural, available light and nothing more, and neither von Trier nor any of the actors involve receive credit in the form of opening or closing titles within the film. This provides Breaking the Waves with an additional later of blunt realism, capturing the ugliness of life as is and not tweaking or modifying its appearance to fit some kind of cutesy disposition or inauthentic portrayal of mood. Dogma 95 is a style that effectively communicates ugliness and it does nothing but elevate this film to a grittier height.Whether you're viewing it as a surface exploration of a battered character driving herself off a cliff she's long rested on the edge of or a story that mirrors the life of our lord and savior, Breaking the Waves is a fantastic motion picture, heartbreaking and, not only brutal, but convincing in its depiction of depravity. Von Trier masterfully contrasts the beauty and intimacy sex can bring and the horrid, unexpected consequences it can bring when practiced in a shallow and unsafe manner, along with putting emotionally complex characters on screen for us to evaluate in several different ways. The 1990's was a decade that allowed for revolutionary cinematic movements far and wide, and amidst incredibly pivotal voices of Richard Linklater and Spike Lee, was Lars von Trier, who showed it like it was in a way nobody wanted to see, but needed to.",

            "content": "Winner of the Grand Prix award at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, & the first in Lars Von Trier's \"Golden Heart Trilogy\". \"Breaking The Waves\" is a cruel, yet somewhat touching film based on a twisted sense of innocence and love. No matter what happens after the credits, the outcome will leave you heartbroken and empty.\"The Golden Heart\" trilogy in a nutshell involves the female protagonist to remain completely naive throughout the story, and virtually give all of herself up to and for the people she loves.Bess (Emily Watson), is a lady with a history of mental problems and is set to marry her beloved Jan (Stellan Skarsgard), despite the negative reactions of her church and family. What begins as a fiery month of passion, tragedy strikes. Though Bess remains faithful, Jan has ideas for Bess that he believes will keep Bess satisfied, and remove any further motivations for suicide.Gut-wrenching to say the least, \"Breaking The Waves\" is clearly the breakout movie for Von Trier and everyone else involved. Especially that of Emily Watson, whose powerhouse performance will challenge you on just how far you are willing to go with her on this twisted tale. Saying that, story has never been the strongest point of Von Trier's movies, and I easily found myself connecting the cruel twists of fate in this picture to his later work \"Dancer In The Dark\" (2000). Situations become too bizarre and ludicrous, just for the sake of beating down this poor woman (I guess that was the overall idea). Still with these kind of setups, the actors have incredible potential and a broad range of emotions available. Shot with Trier's Dogme95 Manifesto, the grainy hillsides of Scotland help lift the fog off the ground, and build a landscape that manages to echo that of its subject matter efficiently and eloquently.Final Verdict: Told in chapters to some superb music cues and locations, This depressive story shall grind you down like no other throughout, yet somehow by the end it manages to instill a sense of hope and optimism rarely seen in cinema. Or at least more than most blatant Hollywood romances go. 7/10.",

Only after I watched Thomas Vinterberg's amazing \"The Celebration\", I got into that \"Dogma 95\" approach to film-making. And when recently I watched, or more appropriately witnessed, the power of von Trier's latest offering, \"Dancer In The Dark\", I made it a point to review all his previous films, starting with this, \"Breaking The Waves\", which I heard was supposed to be similar to \"Dancer\".And it is. At the heart of it is the heartbreaking and gut-wrenching portrayal of a saint-like woman who goes through a living hell for the sake of her loved ones, in this case Bess McNeill, as amazingly played by Emily Watson, and in this case, the character's husband (Stellan Skarsgard).\"Breaking The Waves\" is a lot more silent than the rather eventful \"Dancer\", but also a tad less powerful. But that is simply because the situation the character's in is never as desperate as \"Dancer\"'s Selma's plight, which accounts for a lesser degree of credibility in the character's behavior. Compared to von Trier's latest, here it seems more as if Watson's character could end her suffering immediately if she just stopped and reconsidered. The difference is that, in \"Dancer\", the object of the main Character's affection is her child, a connection stronger, I figure, than Bess's relation to her (not always so lovable) husband.That nit aside, it's still a disturbing and moving film that's worth the attention it got, especially in the rather weak movie year 1996. Just as with \"Dancer\", top credit goes to the fabulous lead actress who effortlessly carries a story that's sometimes a bit hard to swallow.8 out of 10.",

She simply brings the character to life and gives the young woman a living, breathing soul. What an accomplishment. Watson's eyes are electric and she speaks volumes with them. She uses her simple beauty to create a vision of awakening sexuality that is nothing less than explosive. This is a performance that will be remembered always as one of the greatest ever recorded on film. While the film itself is a somewhat flawed masterpiece, Watson is without a doubt fantastic beyond all comprehension. That she was not awarded an Academy Award renders the Oscars meaningless for all time.

This is one movie I've been so engrossed by, I found it hard to switch the VHS off, if to finish watching the 158 film, the next day, giving it some extra minutes, before I clocked off. Never have I been gripped by such an unbelievably real and emotionally charged performance, as that of Emily Watson, who indeed has mental problems. Not that she isn't surrounded some other great performers, their reputation proved, when seeing them in other films. Oilman, Stellarsgard, nothing like the physics professor from Good Will Hunting, here with long stringy hair, a bit of a flabby body, suffers a fatal mishap that leaves him paralyzed. Unable to perform sexually, he beseeches his love to go out and have random sex and that come back and tell him the juicy details, in depth, that basically gets him off. One scene on a bus, where she made a move on an old Codger, was a riot. I guess that's proving your love. Watson's performance is magnetic, all so authentic, and the hand held shots work well. Stellarsgard is really the only one who gives her leverage or understands her. I really liked his free spirited and determined character, such a reality and natural self about it, where some other times you think he's obnoxious, but it's real. Nell is (Watson) from a strict church background, her mother, harsh, sister (Cartlidge) overprotective. None a moment is more disturbing after she makes one too many trips out of port, for some sex and coin, the client, a frighteningly chilling Udo Kier, anchored on one of those big ships. This is easily Lars's best film, better than those antichrists, or nymphomaniacs, which judging by those ones, you can't believe he made one as good as this, and probably won't make anything that will better it. It's pacing is slow and steady, but necessary for the story flow, proving by the end of it, so and steady can win the race. It doesn't wrap up the way you think, like a twist you could say, on one side of the scale tragic but on the other, inspiring. Great films like these, come along so often, as it more Indie/Art-house type, but these films really set the trend for the 1990's. A bloody absorbing film about real love which more people should be informed about. Don't overlook this pearl.",

Frustratingly, it's hard to separate these two gifts: it seems to be in his nature to continually push the envelope, and dare his audience to judge whether he is doing so with a straight face. Although still far-out by the standards of mainstream cinema, 'Breaking the Waves' is perhaps his most conventional English-language film; and also his best, a movie of rare emotional power. Dominated by a literally eye-rolling performance from Emily Watson in the lead role, the film also features a strong supporting cast including, among others, the late Katrin Cartlidge, unnervingly abrupt inter-cutting between scenes, the odd (but effective) division of the movie into chapters marked by musical interludes, and a fiercely imagined vision of life in western Scotland. If one looks away, one might the extreme nature of the story was constructed solely to shock; but to divert one's eyes from this mesmerising film would be a hard thing to do. Almost every scene is perfectly judged; only perhaps the very last image seems misplaced. von Trier's movies generally leave you gasping in both admiration and exasperation; but this one is among the finest, and most distinctive, movies of the 1990s: compulsory viewing, but not for the weak.",

She at first devoted herself to God and the Christian church, but when she meets Jan, she slowly grows away from the church and realizes true love can only be given to another human. Jan is not a Christian, but when Bess gets married to him, they do it at her church. To their surprise, there are no church bells once they get married. \"We don't need bells to worship God\" states one of the ministers. Jan is still surprised, and Bess states \"I like church bells.\" She begins a slow descent when she prays for her husband to come home, who leaves every week for work, which tears her apart to be away from him, since, devoting herself to Christianity, this is the first time she feels real love for another human, and of course makes love with him. He does come back, but he becomes paralyzed. He wants Bess to move on and find a new man to love because he knows he must die, and even attempts suicide. Once he is told Bess will do anything to make him happy, he asks her to make love to a man and tell him about it since he can't experience it anymore. I believe this was at first done because he wanted her to find someone new to love, and he now knew she didn't care about herself but would do anything for him, but Jan realizes it is slowly devolving into him exploiting her for his own benefit, and he begins to hate himself for it. He asks to die, and says he's sick, but Bess cannot stop loving him. She begins to lose contact with her God, and cares only for Jan. She practically becomes a hooker on accident, and after she is abused on one of her most desperate attempts, she is sent to rehab, but escapes before she is even inside the building. She tries to go back to the church, but is then thrown out for stating that you can't love a \"word\" but only a person. She lays on the ground as the kids she once befriended throw rocks at her. The priest stares at her, but leaves and refuses to help. At that moment she has nothing. Then her sister comes to her. She feels love from her sister once again, and must've remembered about her love for Jan, because she asks her sister to pray for Jans recovery and for him to walk again (which is almost impossible) and goes back to the boat where she was abused before. But this time, on her way there, she feels God again. She has hope and believes in love. She is brought to the hospital with knife wounds all over her body. She did this to see Jan for one last time to make sure he is recovering, but he isn't. She is afraid, and she dies.Things may seem very hopeless at this point, and they are. At that point. After this, we see a court hearing, and Dr. Richardson diagnoses her as being good, and to our surprise, Jan is sitting up in a chair there. We see him using his crutches to walk around, showing he was healed. The church, however, has decided that they must bury Bess as a sinner and condemn her to hell. Bess's sister comes and proclaims they don't have the power to do that, and they don't. Jan and his friends steal her body so she doesn't have to go out that way, and they dump her into the ocean. But the next day, when they wake up, they walk outside and, despite their being nothing on the radar, they hear church bells in the sky. We see a shot from the church bells in the sky. Bess is in peace. This shows that no laws from a book can define the goodness of a human being. Bess was a completely selfless human, but she ended up being condemned by the church she once supported for being a \"sinner\". God sits in the sky and laughs at these people who have never felt true love, just as Bess does, who finally got her church bells.As Bo Burnham says in his song \"From God's Perspective\", \"My love's the type of thing you have to earn, but when you earn it, you won't need it\". Bess earned it, but didn't need it. She was nothing but \"good\", as Dr. Richardson says.",

If von Trier's intention was to make a black comedy, this film may be a genius masterpiece that is far beyond my intellect, but I know for a fact that this wasn't the intention and therefore I can only describe this film as a very sad example of gluttony in sentimentality. If you want to watch a movie that actually succeed on the points where Breaking the Waves falls, your better watch Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration (Festen), in my opinion a much better movie made on the same artistic concept.",

It made me sick at my stomach and squirm in my seat to watch this. I never figured out if he was suffering from lack of oxygen to his brain, if he was trying to live vicariously through her, or if he was just a sadist! The scene with the children throwing rocks and the scene where they throw her out of the church are both just heart-wrenching. I felt like I'd been beaten or raped when this movie was FINALLY over.

Even on a VHS format, I felt violated to pay $3.17 to sit down for nearly 3 hours, observing something I cared nothing of. Why it was on so many Top 10 lists, I may never know. You're just as well as having a trite Hollywood action movie on a critic's Top 10 lists. While some of you may have tolerance for unsympathetic slow paced melodramas, I am not saying I dislike Lars Von Trier's work. THE KINGDOM and ZENTROPA were two exceptional and well made films, and I'm quite surprised he didn't continue on with more of his intricate and vibrant imagery after that.  In this, I felt as if I just saw footage of a shakey faded video camera filming feces ridden ocean waves on a rainy foggy Spring day. Can you picture THAT? \"Waves\" never breaks, but disappoints.The film focuses on Bess (Emily Watson) a simple minded woman who weds an oil rigger (Stellen Skarsgard). After an accident  which leaves Jan (the rigger) paralized from the waste down, he convinces Bess that the only way he will improve would for her to have sexual affairs with other men, and then tell him the details. This would of been a better idea if it had been a Red Shoe Diaries installment...not that \"Diaries\" is even better than this.This film never got going from start, the characters talked as if they didn't exactly have the lines memorized (so it took them a while to remember). In the time I sat through it, I was waiting for something to happen. Waiting for a tragedy that really touched the viewer. Waiting for the dialogues to speed up. Waiting for the camera to stand still. Waiting for someone to  say an intriging philosophical quote. It would of been shocking if a U.S. politician appeared in front of the camera all of a sudden and did a nude dance to a Bee Gees song. No, nothing   happened. Just slow dialogue, fece laden ocean waves, faded cinematography, old ugly men, Watson making grins as if she just passed gas, and a boring, psychological plot that never had potential in the first place. The ending (which was said to be sad and tragic) left me with a straight face.If you are interested in what you see about this film above, go ahead and see it. Otherwise, if what you read about this film doesn't appeal to you, it probably won't. If you're going to see this film regardless of what you think of it, don't forget plenty of caffine and dossages of Prozac.One of the worst pieces of pretentious of crap of 1996.",

The husband works at sea in an oil rig and suffers a serious accident there which breaks his neck making him totally disabled. This fact unchains a series of actions and reactions also in psychological and affective terms, some of them very odd, uncommon and perverted, namely in the sexual field that reveal that they both have neurotic personalities which makes those events a bit difficult to be accepted in terms of reality or to have an aesthetic value in terms of cinema or literature.

Later, as the main character's life stabilizes, so does the camerawork. In that film, the camera technique irritated me, but seemed to go with its story later on. In Breaking the Waves, the camerawork remains distractingly wobbly throughout the entire film and the edits stay strange and off-kilter. I realize that this is a style, but it's a style that distracts from the message of the film so much that it drove me crazy. This film was all about trauma and grief and guilt... but it didn't get me emotionally involved in the main character. I not only didn't mind if she suffered, I wished that she would hurry up and die already. The only sorrow I felt while watching this film was that it never seemed to end..

His simple-minded wife (Emily Watson), who prayed for his return, feels guilty; even more, when Jan urges her to have sex with another and report back.Casting was done perfectly for this, from Bess to the nurse and even down to the great Udo Kier as the Sadistic Sailor. Helena Bonham Carter was said to be von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. This loss is Watson's gain, as this may be her best role.The thing about this movie is not any lesson we might learn, it is the very definition of love. If one partner is in a coma or incapacitated, does this make it okay for the other partner to pursue physical love elsewhere? What if the other partner fully encourages it? This film explores the ins and outs of that very well, including the repulsion Bess feels when trying to touch another man. Although the nudity is excessive, it is also necessary in order to shock and drive home the point.There is also the question of religion, particularly within the boundaries of a Calvinist faith. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred, and she must believe that everything is God's will. Is there a greater good? And does God recognize that in His wider view of the world?\"Breaking the Waves\" was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese during a show they filmed together. The only other film to be in both of their Top Ten lists was \"Fargo\". Ebert says the film \"is emotionally and spiritually challenging, hammering at conventional morality...

            "content": "Dancer in the Dark is one of the most emotionally devastating films I've ever seen. It's one of the extremely few films to actually make me cry and its sheer power makes it Lars Von Trier's masterpiece for me. When I heard about Breaking the Waves and how it's part of the same 'Golden Hearts' trilogy as Dancer in the Dark, I just had to see it. I'm not a normal cinema-goer who goes out to see mainstream films for entertainment. Of course, I do do this from time to time. I'm not a complete film snob. However, the films which I admire the most are the ones which pack a strong emotional punch which you never forget. I love depressing films which stun me into silence and play on my mind for days after seeing it. Breaking the Waves is one of these films.Whilst I personally don't think it's quite as good as Dancer in the Dark (I just love how Dancer in the Dark is a musical and everything) it's certainly not far off, and is definitely one of Lars Von Trier's (a director I admire very much) greatest films and one of the greatest films I've ever seen period. Just like Dancer in the Dark, the film opens on a happy and humorous note. Our hero, Bess is getting married to the love of her life, Jan and everyone's having a wonderful time. Not least is Bess who discovers the magical powers of making love. A stark contrast to the loveless sex she has during the crushing final hour of the film.Lars presents their love as an honest and pure one. It's cleverly against the backdrop of a god-fearing, miserable Scottish village that aren't very Christian at all. It shows how damaging religion can be to someone as childlike and naive as Bess, who regularly plays out conversations with God and imagines Him as a cruel and impatient old man with no sympathy for anyone. Lars takes his time in telling the story. The first part of the film looks at how in love Bess is with Jan. She's absolutely infatuated with him and is outrageously devastated when he has to go back to the oilrigs for some time. Emily Watson makes Bess' pain feel all the more overwhelming with her realistic portrayal of hysteria.Like most of Lars' films, Breaking the Waves is broken up into a series of chapters. Each one becomes more disturbing as the film goes on. Many have accused Lars of being sadistic and nihilistic in his treatment of Bess, however I disagree. If Lars wanted to be sadistic then he would have been much more explicit in the latter scenes of the film and wouldn't have given as much time to allow Bess to develop as a character. As I said before, the film is very patient in telling the story and whilst I wasn't bothered or bored by this at all others may be. It's important to be patient with the film and allow yourself to immerse yourself in it. The earlier scenes which depict Bess anticipating Jan's arrival are slow but extremely important. It just shows how much Bess is in love with Jan, and how childlike and charming this love is.When Jan is paralysed we feel Bess' pain. She sticks by him and just wants to be with him. It's all the more tragic that this is her undoing. Bess' descent into sexual degradation and humiliation becomes increasingly more painful to watch. It's all the more excruciating as the film is shot on Lars' signature raw hand-held camera which gives the film an incredible sense of documentary realism. There's nothing you can do but weep for poor Bess and her immature ways of thinking. I didn't cry, but I almost did. Tears filled in my eyes in some parts and a very potent lump formed in my throat. It's an incredibly powerful look of a woman's life spiralling into madness.Breaking the Waves is a powerful and heart-breaking piece of cinema. Emily Watson is incredible as Bess and really does immerse herself in her character. I don't know who else Emily was up against in the Oscars, but I'm pretty sure she should've won. The surrealistic ending is bound to infuriate many, but for me it just confirmed the film as a masterpiece. It was the perfect way to end and made the film all the more powerful. It's not an easy watch and it's extremely depressing, but it's also one of the most heart-breaking experiences I've had watching a film. Lars Von Trier has created a timeless masterpiece. One which has the power to move, compel and inspire.",

Von Trier seemed to hate Emily Watson, putting her through the mill even more than Tarantino did with Uma Thurman in \"Kill Bill\". The religious symbolism was heavy handed e.g. Emily Watson dressed like a whore being stoned by village children, a reference to Mary Magdalene stoned but saved by Christ. Here however the village priest leaves her like a lump of garbage. Thanks Lars for ladling that one on. I think this was the start of his \"dogma\" obsession which has meant that his films are becoming progressively more art-school, amateurish and heavy handed. It's like he's on his pulpit telling us how the world is, which is, ironically, what he accuses the religious killjoys in the film for doing. Boo hiss Lars.",

The film moved me in ways I thought not possible.It stars Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) as Bess, who marries Jan, played by Stellan Skarsgard (Good Will Hunting). It takes place in 1970s Scotland in a very religious and close knit community. Bess and Jan are very much in love, showing their affection everywhere. When Jan has to go back to work on the oil rig, it is too much for Bess to bare. Bess is mentally unstable, even talking with God about trying to be good and doing anything for Jan to return to her. When Jan becomes paralyzed on the rig, she feels that the blame is on her for not being a good Christian and decides to make up for it by sleeping with other men.The film is heart wrenching to watch. Bess believes that what she is doing is right. I have never seen a character so devoted to another. She is willing to give up everything for Jan to walk again. Jan on the other hands has suicidal thoughts and due to the medication and his unhealthy state, is in favor of Bess' sleeping around for him. Regardless of the opposition from friends, family, and doctors, Bess keeps on trying to make things right.In any other situation we would be shunning Bess for what she is doing. The story allows for us to become attached to her, thereby making it okay for what she is doing. We understand her condition and her situation, and although what she is doing isn't right, we forgive her and wish she would realize what she is doing. Some characters we root for, but this one we plead with. As an audience member it is hard not to cry out to her and tell her that things will get better.Lars von Trier does a remarkable job telling this story. He lets us to look at this extraordinary situation in a drastically different society where the church has the power and if you are an outsider you already have a knock against you. The characters are so real and very well developed. We are thrust into this marriage right away and without knowing many of the names, backgrounds, and connections, we get a pretty clear picture about how these characters are going to operate.The film is visually impressive. I had seen some examples of some other Dogme 95 films, but I was never very impressed. This completely shattered my preconceived notions of the style. The camera bobs around like a cross between a home video, documentary, and point of view perspective. It's very intense at times, especially with Watson's energized and dramatic performance.The ending of this film, the very last scene, is so beautiful and that I can hardly contain myself. I could not stop smiling as I fought back the tears. I'm not one to cry at movies, but I think if I saw this again (which I definitely will) I will lose it at the end. It's truly beautiful. It's perfect, surreal, and everything the film needed.It's a long, exhausting film (a little over two and half hours), but it is worth every second. Truly magical.",

Basically in a community in the north of Scotland that is repressed and deeply religious lives the young and naive Bess McNeill (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Watson), who has a strong belief in God, to the point where she often talks to herself answering as the voice of the lord, and she has other childlike qualities and some psychological problems. Despite this she is happily married to oil Norwegian oil rig worker Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), and they enjoy each other's company in the time they have together, but she finds it very difficult to be without him while he works on the platform, only making occasional phone calls discussing their love and sexual desires, including her talking about his prick. Bess prays for Jan to return immediately home, but tragedy strikes he is caught in an industrial accident and he ends up paralysed, and he is flown back to mainland to hospital, and feeling strong grief and distress Bess believes that her prayers are what caused the accident to occur. Jan is really badly affected by the tragedy because he knows his paralysis means it will be pretty much impossible to ever be able to perform sexually with his wife, and knowing the affect it will have on Bess as well he asks her to find a new lover, and shocked she storms out on him, and meanwhile Jan attempts and fails a suicide and unconscious stays in hospital. Slowly his condition deteriorates and he keeps urging his wife to find other men and have sex with them, and tell him everything that happened, all details, so it will seem like they were together and are keeping their love and passion alive, and eventually she tries in small ways to do this, for example, masturbating a man on the bus. Bess comes to believe that what she is doing, when she gives into his idea, are in accordance with her love for Jan, and the will of God, who she eventually starts talking to and using her own voice with again, and despite her guilt and agitation being with other men she does believe she is keeping her husband alive. In the end, after spending so much time branded by those who she knows as a tart or a prostitute, Bess is put into a mental institution, which she escapes from, and a trip to the docks get her sent to hospital where she needs an operation, but it is unsuccessful and Bess dies, while Jan lives on in his wheelchair and she is married at sea. Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as Dodo McNeill, Jean-Marc Barr as Terry, Udo Kier as Sadistic Sailor / Man on the trawler, Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Richardson, Jonathan Hackett as Priest and Sandra Voe as Mother. Watson gives an extraordinary performance as the innocent woman struck by tragedy and forcing herself into sacrifice for her true love, and in his moments Skarsg\u00e5rd is likable before his accident and then gives a suitably sympathetic performance, the story is very profound as it exposes how faith and passion can influence decisions, it is very moving and sometimes depressing, but a most watchable drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. Very good!",

            "content": "\"Breaking the Waves\" is an emotionally potent (though rather heavy) romantic drama for its first half and then a cruel exercise in sadistic torture for its second. What starts as a relatively normal drama about a newly married couple struck by tragedy when the husband is paralyzed in an oil rig accident transforms into something much more intense, upsetting and emotionally manipulative. Von Trier is obviously known as a provocateur, and this film is no different. I guess what surprises me is that most people seem generally moved by this film. While I'd agree with that in relation to its first half, which feels very genuine and humanist, it's second half is something else entirely.For a long time it's about the undying power of love in the face of physical hardships and it is very touching. Then one scene changes the films entire course and sends an already very heavy emotionally draining drama straight into the pits of hell. Character actions stop making sense, our protagonist goes down an easily avoidable path of self- destruction in a misguided attempt to save her husband, and the audience is dragged through the mud in increasingly uncomfortable, and sometimes absurd ways. By the time the wife decides to go back a second time to this mysterious rape boat owned by Udo Kier as a means of curing her husband (it's as odd as it sounds), you know you're not really watching the same film.I've enjoyed many of Von Trier's movies, and while this review might sound on the contrary, I enjoyed this one a lot too. I watched it on blu ray and it looked fantastic. Say what you will of Von Trier's visual aesthetic (which, with its grainy hand-held photography, is admittedly exhausting), the new high definition transfer really brings out the depth and raw beauty in his images. It is not a sloppy looking film as some have argued.What is most unsettling about Breaking the Waves is how it just kind of dramatically explodes halfway through, and while I don't really find it very moving (it's too sick and mean-spirited to feel very genuine, especially it's appalling \"happy\" ending), it is fascinating and absorbing all the way through. I don't think it quite works, but I appreciate its willingness to take the audience on an excruciating journey and let them ponder on such interesting topics as religious faith and the power (or absence) of God. Emily Watson is a revelation and Bess is a fantastic character. Even when Von Trier manipulates the narrative in the cruelest and most unnecessary ways just to further torture this poor woman, she still anchors the entire film. I do feel like the second half betrays her character to some degree, but it's still a perfectly modulated performance from beginning to end. She has two standout scenes in the second half that I find very troubling, but also undeniably powerful.My final point is that Lars Von Trier is insane and while this is one of his more normal looking movies, it is anything but. Proceed with caution.",

            "content": "Having just seen the new Criterion release of this film, I am compelled to return to my original cinema review in order to express the fact that the Criterion Collection has outdone itself with what it has achieved with Breaking the Waves. Everything about this film is more intimate and the earth shattering performance of Ms. Emily Watson now has an even more heart wrenching effect on the viewer. Her interview that is part of the presentation is wonderfully charming, deeply insightful, simply humble, funny, and utterly perfect. What she offers is an invaluable contribution to the motion picture audience. Criterion has made Watson's work so clear it will leave you breathless, literally fighting to catch a mere gulp of oxygen. Whether one cares for this film or not, the fact is that Emily Watson gives a historic performance that will overwhelm audiences for many generations to come, as long as there is cinema. Her interpretation of the character of Bess is beyond anything ever before put on celluloid. That she was not awarded an Academy Award the year she stunned audiences in this film has resulted in Oscars being considered meaningless to anyone appreciative of great acting. In fact, Ms. Watson continues to give deeply of her soul in every subsequent role she has assayed and elevated each film and fellow actors with her work. Her simple beauty and magnificent heart gave life to turgid melodramas such as Angela's Ashes, brilliance to Adam Sandler's vehicle Punch-Drunk love, and set the screen on fire with a never before seen motion picture passion in Hillary and Jackie. A moving children's' piece such as the Water Horse was given depth and realism due to her incredible portrait of the mother and widow whose sexuality roils just beneath the surface of her grief. No other actor, male or female, has left audience members so stunned, so incapacitated, and so staggered by every single performance. Emily Watson is not simply the most gifted actor to ever step before a camera, she is a precious gift to cinema, a jewel beyond price, and the single most important actor of all time. Her work in Breaking the Waves set a bar that few actors could reach again, yet she exceeds that height of authentic greatness time after time. It would not be an overstatement to say that cinema was created as a medium so that Emily Watson's genius as an actor, her unique beauty as a woman, and her authentic expression of life itself could be shared with all humanity across the ages, for all time. With this humble review upon the ultimate presentation of the film by Criterion, this is all reaffirmed and can never be denied by anyone who sees it.",

First of all, the camerawork made me naucious.  I realize that this was an attempt at an off the wall style of directing (for the big screen, anyway), but found it to be distracting as the film dragged on.  I use the word dragged, because that's exactly what it did... Drrraaaaaggggggeeeedddd.  I was never able to develop any sort of empathy for or interest in any of the characters, and the plot was uninteresting in most parts, and disturbing AND uninteresting (which I didn't realize was possible) in others.  However, the acting in the film was above par.  Overall, though, the acting was not enough to save this ultimately doomed movie.  Bury this one with that insane, annoying, clueless woman.

Some of these are only touched on though, with no real development or conclusion. Moreover, the story is told in a very drawn-out fashion. The movie could easily have been less than two hours long but von Trier stretches it out to over 2 \u00bd hours through extending scenes well beyond their usefulness and including scenes that add nothing to the movie.Not entirely engaging either, so the 2 \u00bd hours moves quite slowly. Bess is not a very likable character \u2013 irascible, controlling, intense and a tad insane. Ending is quite emotional though and provides good closure to the story. Another plus is the great soundtrack.Overall, reasonably interesting but is a test of patience.",

While the mentioned titles and the Waves introduce sexuality as the theme, the Waves bring a nostalgic yet fragile picture of a religious girl who find herself in the situation to obey his paralysed husband, by trying having sex with other men in their religious-close minded coastal town.The film divided by seven chapters, begin by panoramic scenery and songs, to the portrait of Emily Watson as Bess. She only wants to make herself a faithful ones to her God and husband. However, her intentions perceived as unstable due to her dependence to her husband. Personally, I might see the picture as the question for religious authorities who bring norms and rules without see deeper, and only results in condemnation over understanding towards others. While religion and religious practices over the world aren't as black and white as the picture portrayed, the picture, accompanied by strong lead actors performance, makes me can stand for a drama film with two hours runtime.While the conversation between Bess and her (or at least her own voice roleplaying) God and the things that somehow always correlated to Jan's condition, make the picture that at first seems so believable and real, begin to enter a magical tale that compromise the rather innocent Bess and her faith, to something unbelievable and light, compared to the dark tone of the film.The whole film is a complete package to everyone who wish to see a picture that beauty on its own technicalities and storytelling. It may perceived as childish at its best, but when you see deeper in Bess' eyes as she tries to communicate and seeks for endurance and faith, I hope you see what I see, a message of faith for those currently in the edge of it.",

            "content": "The annals of acting feature  a number of truly astonishing performances. However, there are a handful which transcend the ordinary so much as to be unforgettable. Among the supreme performances by ACTRESSES, I would rank Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc, Joanne Woodward in The Three Faces of Eve, Katherine Hepburn in Long Days Journey into Night and in The Philadelphia Story Liv Ullman in Cries and Whispers( or in almost any Bergman film), and Giuletta Massina in La Strada and in Nights of Cabiria. Emily Watson, in this, her first screen performance (!), puts herself in their pantheon. I loved Frances Mcdormand in Fargo, however, Emily Watson was clearly the one who should have gotten the Oscar.There were actually critics who attacked Bess as a \"slut' or a \"kook\", or who called Breaking The Waves an 'anti-religous' film. Rather than waste time attacking such Philistines and Pharisees, I will simply say that Emily Watson  offers a performance of such tenderness, vulnerability, and dignity as to be worth a hundred sermons. Rarely have both touching, simple minded faith and unashamed eroticism been combined in such away.I can think of only one other instance when a self-sacrificing martyrdom has been shown with such power-Dreyers the Passion of Joan of Arc.Thanks to Emily Watson and (Stellen Skarsgaard and Karin Cartlidge), and thanks to Von Trier's magnificent direction and Mullers \"cinema verite'\" cinematography, Breaking the Waves becomes that rare thing, an instance of what Paul Schrader called \"transcendental style \", fully comparable to the very best of Ozu, Dreyer, Rossellini, and Bresson.",

            "content": "Set in the Scottish countryside of the 1970s, comprised of grainy images and hand-held photography, this first installment in Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier's Golden Heart Trilogy is deeply and metaphysically formidable, pummeling at orthodox purity with the omniscient certitude that God not only exists and sees all, but appreciates a great deal more than we give him credit for. It tells the story of Bess, a simple woman of unfeigned innocence, who subscribes herself to sexual brutality to save the life of the man she loves. Is she a sinner? The forbidding bearded elders of her church think so. But Bess is the kind of person Jesus was thinking of, if he was any kind of god at all, if he suffered the little children to come unto him.Even while this is surely one of the more accessible films Von Trier has written and directed, it nevertheless includes various remarkable divulgences. It has the sort of fresh impact, the kind of vulnerable consideration for the power of good and evil in the world, that we tend to want to sidestep. It is easier sometimes to wrap ourselves in romanticism and nice hackneyed sayings, and forget that God supposedly forged nature \"bloody in tooth and nail.\" Bess does not have our capacity for justification or cop-outs, and dauntlessly submits herself to God as she understands him.This performance by Emily Watson is more like that of an animal than a woman, deriving from impulse rather than contemplation and judgment. It is not a bleak performance and is a number of times stroked by comedy and happiness, which makes it all the more touching, as when Bess talks out loud in two-way conversations with God, speaking both voices, making God a grim adult and herself a guileless child. Her church expels her, and little boys in the village throw stones at her. Von Trier makes us ponder what sorts of movies Dostoevsky might've given us. He finds the inflexibly undiluted thread through the heart of a story, and is not made anxious with what cannot be known: This movie does not explain Stellan Skarsgaard's inhuman demand of his wife, because Bess does not question it. It shows people who care about her, such as the sister-in-law and the local doctor, and others who do not: Auditor-like clergymen like the bearded church elders. They comprehend nothing about their Christianity save for authoritarian standards they have learned.Not many movies like this get made, because not many filmmakers are so fearless, aggressive and daring. Similar to quite a lot of genuinely religious films, it will displease the hypocrites. Here we have a story that compels us to take sides, to ask what truly is right and wrong in an existence that feels bitter and aloof. Is belief in a god merely a comfort for our certain outcome in loss of life? Or can faith afford the ascendancy to prevail over death and evil? Many of us believe the former for sure, but Bess believes the latter for sure. And there's something all too real about Bess.",

            "review_title": "Martyrdom for female 'jouissance', and a question of genre",
            "content": "I was disappointed in this film, perhaps because I watched it on video, soon after having seen 'Dancer in the Dark' at the cinema which had whetted my appetite to see more of von Trier's work.I hesitate to say this, given how positively I responded to 'Dancer in the Dark', but 'Breaking the Waves' reminded me a little of the day-time tv hospital-dramas that I occasionally watched as a child in the 1950s.  The division of the film into \u0091chapters' (episodes) heightens its tv-serial feel.  Why didn't von Trier use non-linear narrative for this story? Wouldn't the film have been more effective if it had first shown Bess prostituting herself, then shown segments of the path that led her there? Or does the portrayal of martyrdom (see below) require strictly linear narrative?While I'm on the subject of the director's breaking the story into chapters, there's a quibble regarding the music for the chapter breaks. The selection of music is heavily nostalgic.  Although the songs' lyrics fit in with the plot, the punctuating of the story with blasts of nostalgia, bearing no intrinsic relation to the film, is jarring.The story in 'Breaking the Waves' struck me as more contrived than that in 'Dancer in the Dark', and I think this is because of the different genres. 'Breaking the Waves' is a pseudo-realist drama \u0096 the pseudo-realism makes the somewhat contrived nature of the story stand out.  The melodrama (or film-opera) genre of 'Dancer in the Dark' shades-out the contrived nature of the story in that film.'Breaking the Waves' delivers a few complex, character-driven moments, but even in these moments, neither the script nor the acting is up to the task; and for the rest, there is practically no layering of character.  All of Bess's action, because of her simple-mindedness and purity, is Coppelia-like \u0096 okay, that is fitting to the character.  But the flatness of other characters is a weakness of the film (here again, if the film were a melodrama, the flatness would not stand out).  The  film divides seagoing men into two types with not a skerrick of ambiguity about them.  Jan's mates are good guys, men who one is led to imagine would never do anything mean like taking advantage of a prostitute.  Totally opposite to them are the baddies of the seagoing world, rough men who'd as soon knife a prostitute as look at her.  Added to this is the stereotyping of the church members, with the exception of the brief scenes depicting the anguish of Bess's mother, mentioned above.Incidentally, there are other filmmakers who have shown greater insight into some of the circumstances that can result in women choosing to be sex workers.  You don't have to watch anything as far-fetched as 'Breaking the Waves' to realise that a prostitute might be a person deserving of your respect.  (Try watching Pasolini's 'Accattone', for instance.)  Is it not a little odd that 'Breaking the Waves' has no characters, other than Bess, who are prostitutes?  If anything, the film tends to reinforce stereotypes of sex workers, in that Bess's case is unique, she doesn't join the regular brigade.  When you think about it, 'Breaking the Waves' works from the premise that a sex worker, as a rule, is not a good woman.  Von Trier is showing us, in Bess (with her unique motivation and her astonishing simplicity, or talent for belief), the exception that proves the \u0091rule'. So, whatever else this film might accomplish, it doesn't erode the stereotype of the \u0091bad' sex worker.And yet \u0085 'Breaking the Waves', like 'Dancer in the Dark', succeeds in bringing the audience face to face with a special, and disturbing, martyrdom.  It confronts us with the martyrdom of the woman who chooses to punish herself for the sin of 'jouissance'.  In Bess's case the jouissance was in the honeymoon love-making with Jan;  in Selma's, it was in having a baby of her own to hold.  I found Selma's case more moving because the last part of the film succeeds in showing us how excruciatingly difficult the punishment is for Selma (and for those around her).  The torture that Bess chooses to endure is supposed to be equally difficult, but the film doesn't make me feel that.I would recommend, to anyone who wants to think further about what it is that makes 'Dancer in the Dark' work better than 'Breaking the Waves', to read Stanley Cavell's essay \u0091Opera and the lease of voice'.",

This is the first major image of Breaking the Waves, the first proper success from Danish enfant terrible Lars Von Trier, director of the hugely forgotten visual masterpiece Europa (1991). With Breaking the Waves he moved away from beautiful pictures to a beautiful story, centring on young naive Bess (Emily Watson), who after marrying oilman Jan (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) begins a life of constant love and passion. That is however until Jan must return to the rigs where he is later crippled in a terrible accident.The film is very impressively made, with Von Trier depicting the harsh Scottish landscapes as a haunting place, and with the digitally enhanced Chapter Headings, shows us that he still has the power to compose stunning images (The rainbow slowly appearing in chapter four is beautiful). He shows here a handle on actors never before seen, the film doesn't look like a film at all, more like a series of real events, Von Trier probes every one of the actors emotions, getting deep inside of them. Everyone of the main principals are terrific, from the much applauded Emily Watson, to Skrasg\u00e5rd in a role that isn't really as trying as people have said. Even supporting players Jean-Marc Barr and Katrin Cratlidge are fantastic as well as the underrated Adrian Rawlins and the terrifying Udo Kier.If the film is lessened in any way, it's by the story. We never feel enough of a connection with Bess to really get upset by what she must do, I don't know how any one can accuse the film of depicting a very sexist view of women, because I don't think Bess is an accurate portrait of Women in this film, she is but herself, the film does however posses the same innocent view of `love conquers all' mentality that Bess has. The film is very similar to Von Trier's other film Dancer in the Dark, but I think Dancer is the much better film, because Selma's predicament is much more believable and pure than that of Bess, so the ending of Dancer comes as much more of a blow to the stomach.Also the ending here is a real head scratcher, I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin the film for any one else, but I've seen the film five times now and I'm still not sure what to make of it, lets just say you'll never forget that last shot and you'll be thinking about it for weeks. Either way, Breaking the Waves is still one-hundred times better than most of the Hollywood hogwash, full of beautiful images and performances, and is a good chance to see a real film by one of cinema's greatest directorial talents...  9/10",

I found Bess's submissiveness almost offensive -- especially the fact that she goes back to the boat where she knows she will be raped and tortured. And also the fact that after that Jan is able to walk again and God makes an appearance (or at least his bells) -- does that mean that we in the audience are supposed to believe that Bess's choices are the right ones? Or is it this von Trier wanted -- for me to feel utterly confused and somewhat disturbed? Well, like I said: his technique of telling the story is quite brilliant and the acting is absolutely sensational. I'm talking about Emily Watson in particular, but also about Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katrin Cartlidge.

The wedding day of Bess McNeill (Emily Watson) and Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsgard) has arrived and we are aware immediately that young Bess has never been in love and is an innocent virgin who is suddenly thrown in with the wolves and forced to grow up.  Jan is an unattractive but gentle groom who knows this all too well but has an unrelenting desire for his new bride and they finally give in to passion when the wedding ceremony finishes up.  The most heartbreaking performance ever to grace cinema was that of Emily Watson as Bess McNeill.  What a pity that Frances McDormand of Fargo was awarded the Academy Award in 1996 instead.  Emily Watson is emotionally drained by the time her last scene airs and you get the sense that she played Bess as she went taking chances and relishing her material.  Bess is gentle and kind and still young in spirit.  She is not mentally ill but the survivor of a nervous breakdown following her brother's untimely death.  She has been sheltered all of her life by the church in which she has no right to speak and there is a true sense that she follows this rule so strictly that she doesn't allow even herself to think or speak in her own mind.  Jan Nyman cares for her deeply and is actually not at all attractive but the scenes that they share behind closed doors are the most passionate ever witnessed in cinema.  They are not vile or disgusting but in truth quite lovely to behold.  How Bess could give herself to a man when she refuses to even allow herself to have feelings is something I pondered for a long time. She has such a desire to please people however, likely something she learned from her church about loving others as you would yourself.  If ever the idea of praying the little children come unto me rings true it is in Breaking the Waves.  Gentle Bess meets a most tragic fate and in the ending we can never forget something truly enchanting occurs.  It may not seem plausible but it is a fitting finale for a saint of sorts.  Scenes strike me even now 6 years after my initial screening.  Consider the elegance of the Scottish landscape and the tiny white church in all of it's glory as the backdrop in which young boys stone gentle Bess as a sort of adulterer.  Or the powerful shots of Bess walking into the tiny church and speaking for the very first time after God finally gave her the words she had searched for for so long.  Lars Von Trier captivates the eyes and mind from start to finish.  Much ink has been spilled regarding the request of Jan Nyman to his lovely and child-like new bride.  His request did not disregard the feelings of Bess but was a heartbreaking way of letting her continue to live while he was confined to his bed and unable to satisfy her.  He did not count on the fact that Bess had so much patience to please him that she did it not for enjoyment but out of pure and unadulterated love that lead her to believe it was what he truly desired.  Never has a woman in film sacrificed so much of herself and looked so lovely and innocent in doing so.10/10",

When she feels an emotion, it's like her entire body acts on it, and you never catch her \"acting.\"  She's shown in later movies like THE BOXER and HILARY AND JACKIE that her performance here is no fluke.HOWEVER...I didn't like this film.  Admittedly, though a Catholic, I'm a skeptic, and any film which takes seriously the mystical parts of religion makes me duck for cover, but this film is ridiculous.  Not only that, it's smarmy in how it asks Bess, the heroine, to whore herself for her husband, and claims that she's doing it for God.  I'm sorry, but I found that offensive.  I wasn't bothered by Lars Von Trier's technique (though I'm amused at the Dogma he and other filmmakers have created from this and similar films), just the subject matter.",

There's something old school about this one, an old fashioned movie without all the bells and whistles that spoil some films. The haunting remote location filming adds to the emotional, dark and at times, humorous story.It's a long one and maybe a bit too long and there are a couple of plot holes that don't really ruin this great movie. For example the hospital in the story seems to have only one Doctor who is responsible for life saving surgery and also mental health reviews and probably everything else and the sister of the main female lead seems at times to be the only nurse in the hospital. But overall this is a big fat ten out of ten for me. A wonderfully emotional roller coaster of a movie that covers everything from love to heartbreak to religious bigotry.On a sad note I was trying to work out where I'd seen the young woman who plays the sister in the movie and now I can only guess I remember her from Brookside, which I watched on and off during the eighties. I was shocked and saddened to learn that this talented and beautiful actress died a few years after filming this. Such a shame. I'm sure she would have gone on to achieve a lot more in acting and directing.10/10",

            "content": "\"Breaking the Waves\" is a painful look at the unexpected power of faith and love. While I thought it was much longer than it needed to be and I had severely mixed feelings about the symbolism-heavy ending, \"Breaking the Waves\" is still a haunting film about what we cherish and what we suffer through when we devote our lives to a another.Our heroine, Bess (Emily Watson, in her legendary film debut), is an innocent, unstable young woman recently married to kindhearted, salt-of-the-Earth oil rigger Jan (Stellan Skarsgard). Sheltered all her life by her strict, religious upbringing, Bess experiences a sexual awakening from Jan's love, and for the first time in her life, she feels real passion and happiness. Her new, blissful life is shattered when Jan is paralyzed in a freak accident, no longer able to make love to his wife. So Bess begins a brutal, emotional journey of sacrifice, that will put her love for Jan, and everyone's idea of faith, to the ultimate test.There are no easy answers in \"Breaking the Waves\". We are forced to question Bess's choices, her faith, and her mental state. It's revealed that she has had a nervous breakdown in the past, her co dependence on Jan worries her pragmatic sister-in-law (the late Katrin Cartridge), and Bess frequently talks to herself as the voice of God whenever she prays. Jan's rather selfish request to his fragile wife, to have sleep with random men so he can vicariously have intercourse with her, makes you wonder if Jan is high on painkillers, brain damaged from the accident, or was just sick in the head to begin with.Or perhaps I'm just being too cynical. Perhaps Bess really is a secular saint chosen by God himself. Perhaps Jan's request of his wife really does send him on the road to recovery. Director Lars Von Trier wisely refuses to spoon feed us a simple solution.Bess and Jan's relationship really reminded me of Christopher and Dana Reeve. True, the Reeves were very wealthy and could afford all the help and physical therapy they needed, but what it really comes down to is the love and sacrifices a married couple are willing to make for each other. It's been said that when Christopher Reeve told his wife she didn't have to stay with him, she told him she would stay, because he was still the same man she loved, injuries and all. Bess stays with Jan and follows his shocking wish for the same reason: he's still the man she fell in love with. Love isn't always pretty, soft, or easy, but can be rough and difficult path that either ends a relationship or make it stronger.\"Breaking the Waves\" may be far from uplifting, but it is a hopeful reminder that, to quote Jan, \"love is a mighty power\".",

He's just a rather silly man who should have become a wine taster\u2014another phony-baloney load of pretentious crap.This film is ridiculous. Like most bad movies, the two most serious flaws are the pacing and the plot. Both are awful here. Some mentally ill woman (who talks to God, and then replies to herself, of course) is made even more mentally unstable when her crippled husband decides he wants her to romp with every man she can, so he can get off on the details. And she does. It sounds like some sort of bad porn movie, doesn't it? But, apparently, that's not what the writers were going for.There isn't any believability to it, either. She just does it\u2014no questions asked. No-one does a thing about it, despite the fact the whole village knows she needs help. The churchgoers throw her out. But the worst part of all this is that I've just summed up the entire movie for you. That's what they shove down your throat for two and a half hours. But I suppose it's better than what she was having shoved down her throat for much longer. The ending is the icing on the cake, which seems to be the pattern with the worst culprits. I.e., Vertigo, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fight Club. Nothing turns Roger Ebert on more than a film about nothing. Believe that, because it's true.There really isn't anything about this film that makes one want to watch it a second time, unless you get off on it, like the woman's husband. It's just a plodding monstrosity of a film, and the good acting cannot save it. I am so tired of movies as bad and pretentious as this one getting high ratings simply because of liars, half-wits, and con men.1/5",

These people don't exist anywhere, in any realm of film-making, in any byway of reality or lack thereof. God, if I had to see Emily Watson's face (in Important Closeup) crumbling, or hear her wailing and screaming and crying, one more time, I was going to turn the damn thing off -- which I did.

The film takes time for you to be able to sink into it, and does a great job of that. Thanks mostly to Emily Watson, who gives one of the defining performances of the 90s here. She is heartbreaking and commands very single inch of the honesty and haunting approach that is needed.Once again, Von Trier has made a near-masterpiece.

What are the limits of love and faithfulness to one's spouse? Can God use any means to accomplish His purpose? Are those who have great faith, to the point of real personal sacrifice, merely deluded?

On an island in the Atlantic, Bess challenges her dominant moral and marries a person named Jan (Stellan Skasgard). She makes love with him and begins to worship his masculine body and becomes obsessed with it. \n 'Breaking the Waves' is a spiritual fable in seven scenes with music and different landscapes. It shows the different kinds of Christian passions which are experienced by the main character after her husband has an accident and is seriously injured. She wants him to live because he says that if he dies it's because his love doesn't keep him alive any more. Bess makes love with other men to describe the experience and try to make him happy.  Lars Von Trier presents sexuality as a carnal element in Bess's life, but also as a loving sacrifice.  The portrait of Bess---her disturbing smile in front of her husband's sickly body, her naughty dresses---is a portrait of kindness and morality.  Though having sex with strangers is the only way to save her loved one, Bess is strong; nevertheless, she finally dies.  Many people wonder about the ending of this movie. I'll try to give an explanation of what I understood: In `Breaking the Waves',  they ring the bell at the end of the movie after Bess dies  because early at the wedding, Jan's friend asks the church to ring the Bell while Jan and Bess are leaving for the reception.  It is then explained that the church refuses  to ring the bell based on an old fashioned idea that it was not proper. The movie itself tries to show what a rigid and old fashioned place it is to live in.  Rules like \"women can't attend funerals\" and \"women can't talk in church\" still remain while the outsiders (Jan and his friends) know that the rest of the world view these rules as reflecting outdated, almost barbaric thinking. Most of the movie is based on Bess's struggle to fit in with this society. At the end her friends want to prove that Bess is better than the people who have condemned her to hell (the church group) and show others what Bess would have enjoyed seeing if she were alive. 7/10",

            "content": "\"Breaking the Waves\" is a live action film from 1996, which means that this one is also over 25 years old now already and it is mostly far from forgotten because the director and one of the three writers is Lars von Trier. This film is in the English language only as it is set up there in Scotland I think or at least the characters (except the male protagonist) have such a background. It is also a co-production of a total of eight European countries, including pretty much the entirety of Scandinavia, but the language aspect here resulted in this becoming von Trier's first big success with American awards bodies. This had especially to do with lead actress Emily Watson. She was under the age of 30 still when this got made and also it was her debut on the big screen. Almost her acting debut altogether, but seems like she appeared on some television show before that already, even if not on many occasions either. So what a success for her here if you look at all the awards she won for her portrayal and also many more awards she was nominated for. This went as high up as it gets, namely to the Oscars. Her director here, von Trier, was a decade older and he won big at the Cannes Film Festival for his effort here. It is probably not von Trier's most known work by today's standards, but surely a triumph and maybe the most known work for his co-writers Asmussen and Pirie with the former sadly no longer with us anymore. What we have here is an extremely long movie at 160 minutes almost, so over 2.5 hours, but if you know von Trier, then this is also not super unusual. He sure has his traditions and this includes his actors as well. Skarsg\u00e5rd is one you will find in several of his films, also more recently and same can surely be stated about Udo Kier. Their names sound similar and Kier is really a regular in terms of von Trier. There is maybe not always great range required from him, but he is a good fit for the characters he plays and also the sadism that is often to them. I mean here it is just a perfect example because it is his character who is somehow responsible in the end for the protagonist's death, even if Skarsg\u00e5rd's character is far from innocent either.This was really shocking though, how she dies there on the stretcher or whatever it was and how suddenly she realizes that she was wrong about all of it. You could say it was a bit rushed, but the bittersweet irony of her dying the moment she understands made it easier to accept this as a vital and realistic part of the story. It came surprising for me, even if there were indicators before that like when we hear other characters say that the main character is not the strongest person in the world. This was sad indeed and when she dies it was maybe the only brief moment where I considered this a great film and not just a good one. You felt for her and it was heartbreaking to see the tears from Katrin Cartlidge's character when it happens. Looking at the fate of this actress, it also makes one sad how she died at such a young age already. So basically roles reversed with the two characters from this film. I wish Cartlidge could have scored the Oscar nomination. It would not have been undeserving. May she rest in peace. She was also a bit of a beauty. With Watson I cannot say the same, but it was oddly fascinating here from the looks perspective: Sometimes her character was quite attractive, on other occasions it was the opposite. By the way, the actress went on to score another Oscar nomination briefly after this film, but since then, number three was not meant to happen. Yet? We will see. She is still a prolific actress for sure. With the rest of the cast you will not really find any big names in here, but it is no surprise as this was not a big Hollywood film and also von Trier was not the star (or the polarizing figure) he became afterwards, especially in the new millennium. Of course, this film also had a lot to offer in terms of nature and cinematography. This was never the essence of the movie, but still nice to look at at times.Not just a feast for the eyes, but also one for the ears we have here. The music was top-notch at times. I must say this of course as I am a huge Leonard Cohen fan and a film that includes his music is always a winner for me, but also some of the other songs used for the beginnings of the chapters were quite catchy. So yeah, we have several chapters in here that are also individual chapters in the protagonist's life. You could probably write a long review elaborating on the connection between the songs and the main character's fate, but we will leave it at that. Apart from the songs, the music you hear during the film on other occasions was also amazing at times. Old tunes from this area of Europe for example. I liked it. It was already very early the case during the wedding ceremony with what we hear there. So these were some of the more delightful moments from this otherwise fairly depressing film at times. I also feel like everybody will see something different in here, also in terms of how much Skarsg\u00e5rd's character is seen as an antagonist. He was of course under heavy medication when he said certain things to his wife, which is definitely maybe not a justification, but an apology. At the beginning of all this, I even felt that maybe Skarsg\u00e5rd's character only wants to help his wife in a way to get closer to other men and forget him because he would soon die anyway, but turns out that this is not what happens. Just look at the twist then when she is dead and he has recovered so much that he can even walk again, admittedly on crutches, but still. Before that he could barely move any muscles below his head or neck. Then again, if you look at the man's actions throughout the film, you will maybe realize that he is not the best for her really. I mean those who oppose the wedding at the beginning are also not too likable, but her man is a bit of a brute.If we move to the end already, when we see the boys throwing stones at her and she eventually collapses, there is almost a Jesus component to her character. Did she die to save her man's life? This was then again completely against the idea of her perceiving her sleazy actions as despicable the way she did the moment she died. In that case, they were not for nothing and really the reason why he recovered. Of course, the way they use these bells at the very end and the camera moves up to the heavens and we know the sounds of the bells must come from up above and must be supernatural because the local church has no bells was quite an exaggeration and von Trier ended the film with a bang if you wanna call it that. As for Skarsg\u00e5rd, he also has a very interesting career, not just the films in which he worked with von Trier, but also how he became part of the Marvel universe (\"Thor\"), how he acted next to Day-Lewis and Binoche before their (first) Oscar wins and there are many more examples that deserve being mentioned. In this film here, we must also see that he cries for his wife in the end after her death and I felt like he really did love her. He was missing her when on the oil rig and when he does some bad things, then only because he is under the influence. Of course, the role of the doctor treating her was interesting too, how she treats him on several occasions, but also how he treats her. He may not love her, but he wants her to be healthy and he even tries to convince her he loves her on one occasion in order to make sure she moves further away from her husband. But it wasn't meant to be. There is by the way also the graphic inclusion of nudity. It maybe helped Watson here that she was more willing to show this much than maybe more experienced and successful actresses would have. The scene when she lies there on the bed ready for the doctor to have sex with her was just one example. We see her topless long before that already. But nudity is always a strong factor with von Trier and that also includes males of course.Another aspect you will always find with von Trier is religion and this film is not an exception there either. The central character is a woman that is extremely faithful to God, yet at the same time a very simple woman and not entirely healthy in the head. This is also why the other woman tries to protect her. Just look at the words she says there to Watson's character's husband about how she will kill him if she has to in order to protect Watson's character. Very telling moment in terms of how protective Cartlidge's character is. Of course, Watson's character went through a lot as we find out during the mentions of her deceased brother. This happened before the movie already. Anyway, I was talking about religion, so you can say that the protagonist suffered a lot and probably she thought that God was trying to test her how much she can take. Her conversations with the Lord show us her mental struggles as well. She literally responds to her own questions and insecurities or, on one occasion, does not respond and then later on resurfaces as the Lord answering her questions again and this was almost a funny moment when she says something like that of course He also has to take care of other people and cannot deal with her alone all the time. However, this supernatural ending with the bells up there and the clouds and also with the man having recovered (they literally said it would be a miracle if he does) felt in a way like you could wonder if it was indeed God speaking through her. In any case, these conversation scenes could have felt ridiculous quickly if executed with less precision, but Watson (and von Trier) nailed them. Overall, I am glad that I got to watch this film on the big screen on the occasion on a film series dealing with Danish film over the decades and I recommend checking this one out, even if I would not call it a great movie. Emily Watson's turn is worth it and I never realized how she has almost the same name like Emma Watson. Thumbs-up.",

The film has a unique picture that seems like a cheap hand-held camera.Somewhat irritating but again i thought that they want to emphasize the story and characters so i didn't mind. It also has an interesting start of a story that seems promising and deep.BUT the story continues without adding anything to the mystery and drama situation it shows and it is moving with a very slow pacing and i mean VERY SLOW, (it is 2:30+ hours film.) In so much time it should really built up interesting characters but no. As the movie continues you will feel that you cant really relate to ANYONE, the story is Bizarre and with absolutely no meaning. Acting is quite bad way worse than most TV shows. I really don't see how it is SO OVERRATED, I ONLY ASSUME CRITICS SLEPT AFTER A WHILE SO THEY RATED THEIR DREAM! Serioysly it is a 3 /10 MAX and that is being generous.

            "content": "Tragedy strikes again. What else could I expect from Breaking the Waves, one of the three films in the 'Golden Heart Trilogy' by Lars von Trier? Well, I certainly knew what was waiting for me: the trilogy's concept is to take something beautiful and innocent and completely destroy it, causing real heartache to the viewers \u2013 so I kinda knew that I'd be watching two and a half hours of suffering. But Breaking the Waves surprised me, and wasn't predictable as I thought: in fact, it's another great film from the Danish director that, this time, added a religious touch to the tale.Breaking the Waves is about Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), a young woman who marries Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsgard) and falls madly in love with him. She's a very innocent, pure of heart and deeply religious person, with a past of psychological issues. When Jan has to leave for work, Bess feels very depressed and struggles to live without him. She starts praying that he returns to her as soon as possible, and that's when everything starts to go downhill. Jan is sent home early because of an accident that causes him to remain completely paralyzed. Unable to perform any movements (including sex) and as his health gets worse, he asks Bess to sleep with other men, convincing her that this will keep him alive because it will be as if the two of them were making love. Bess believes that his return and his request are all God's actions for the good of everybody, so she listens to him: soon, she finds herself in a very difficult and painful position.As I said before, von Trier's goal here is to cause you pain while watching the movie. It makes you pretty uncomfortable and always waiting for the worst to happen \u2013 but maybe that's just me. I had the constant feeling that something bad was just waiting around the corner and the movie ended up creating really awful situations \u2013 even though I thought it would be displaying much worse scenarios. To make a comparison, it wasn't as harsh as Dancer in the Dark was. Both featured amazing acting (especially by the female protagonists) and very good directing, but Dancer in the Dark featured more tragedy, with a crueler finale. I felt like the world was being much harsher to Selma (Dancer in the Dark's protagonist) and she couldn't do anything about it, while Bess could've had some control over the story hadn't she been that innocent, naive and religious. But that's what's special about Breaking the Waves: it heavily features the religious element.I personally quite enjoyed the religious elements in the movie (despite not being a religious person). The protagonist prays to God every day, and believes in Him to the point that she is convinced God answers her prayers through her own voice. The scenes in the movie where she prays and 'talks' to God can get really creepy. Bess thinks that some things, that happen in the movie, did so because she asked God to make them happen, and when those things are bad she feels guilty. But guilt is a feeling she often displays. What made the movie even worse (for Bess, but better for the viewer) are the surroundings and the location. The film is located in the Scottish Highlands, in the early 1970s: a very conservative place, where everything is church-based and God-centered, and that is the reason for Bess' strong faith. Since the town's people and the priests are very conservative and harshly judge her actions, this leads to her being eventually cast out of the church community and her own family as well. I felt some kind of irony here, that von Trier intended to portray: even if your actions are for the good, even if you deeply believe in God and you do everything for him and the people you love, even if you're selfless and would do anything for love \u2013 you will still be judged by the Church and the 'interpreters of God's word'. I think von Trier wanted to show the rotten side of the Church, the fact that it doesn't represent true religion anymore and it divides the faithful in two: the ones who base their faith on the Church, and the' true believers'.The film features many unexpected turns and, despite being an overall tragic movie, some of those turns were very pleasant and light hearted. The movie's unpredictability is one of the things that made the whole experience even more enjoyable. All in all, I liked it very much. Every aspect of it was good, from the directing, to the writing, to the superb acting especially, and it's another example of von Trier's masterful skills as a director. It's admirable how inventive von Trier can be: by using the same theme (the destruction of something beautiful) he manages to create completely different situations and develop them in different ways, always causing a huge impact on the viewer. This wasn't a light experience, but what usually makes a movie even better for me is the fact that it's challenging \u2013 and von Trier's movies are always good challenges.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",

            "content": "Warning: MAJOR SPOILERS I saw Breaking the Waves yesterday for the first time, and after reading the comments, I can't believe so many people think this movie is blasphemous or anti-religious. When they think Bess' attitude is inhuman or undignified, they must think that about Jesus' too! Jesus was sent by God (as Bess by Jan) to the earth to suffer and die for love, and he also doubted and talked to his father. He criticized the Pharisees and was condemned, as Bess criticized her community. Bess takes her bike and the children throw stones to hurt her, as Jesus carried the cross. She is hurt on her back with a knife, and it looks as she had been whipped. Before Jesus was killed he asked \"Father, why have you abandoned me?\", and God doesn't answer Bess before she goes to the big boat the second time. She also seems to have been wearing a thorn crown when she is brought to the hospital. In the end her body disappears from the grave. Jesus and Bess sacrificed themselves for love, and in the end the miracle happened: Jan got cured. I am no Bible or religion expert, but I don't think von Trier is trying to tell us that we should be like Bess and humiliate ourselves, because the Bible says Jesus has already done it for us. So what is anti-religious about this movie? Emily Watson, Jan and Dodo (and Dr. Roberts) were just wonderful, the photography is amazing and brilliant, and I think you can greatly enjoy this movie even if you don't care about the religious analogies.",

            "content": "I saw the movie years ago, and I recently saw it again. I must say, it is a quite interesting movie, it kept my interest all the way. But it does have some very strange themes.Emily Watson is Scot Bess McNeill, and as we get to know her character find that she is quite unusual. First off, she is very spiritual, and goes to the local church to talk to God in times of trouble. Uniquely, God answers through Bess, in a slightly deeper voice. We don't really know if Bess is just a bit \"off\" or maybe God really speaks to her.As the movie begins she waits for a helicopter carrying Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Jan Nyman, whom she is going to marry. To show Bess's strange character, when the helicopter carrying a full load of men arrives late, she becomes very upset with Jan, even though it was not anything he did. But they get married and have a nice couple of weeks together before he has to go back to his job on the oil rig.Emily Watson is superb, as this very quirky Bess. This is a captivating movie, but some may not think that it is a good movie. YOU have to decide for yourself.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Bess doesn't want Jan to go, she loves him too much and wants him near her. But being practical, he goes back to work. Bess prays that Jan come back to her and, when he gets injured badly, which brings him home, she blames herself, that her prayer caused him to be injured. Basically a quadriplegic with poor prognosis, Jan tells Bess that the only thing that will keep him going is for her to find another man to have sex with, so she can tell Jan about it, as a way to stay connected, since sex was such a big part of their early time together as newlyweds. Bess doesn't want to do this, but eventually relents. She gets herself into a pickle on a merchant boat, is badly beaten, and soon after dies in the hospital. At a burial service the clergyman says Bess \"will certainly go straight to hell.\" Jan, who has now gotten some mobility, chastises them. He eventually recovers enough to go back on the rig, when a miracle happens. They go out to see church bells ringing in the clouds far above the rig, they represent Bess, in Heaven, helping to watch over them.",

            "content": "\"Breaking the Waves\" is a film that is very difficult to sum up in a few short words. While the look is very earthy and simple, the emotional depth is limitless. Viewers who do not pay close attention are likely to miss out on what is one of the most powerful and enlightening films of the decade.Emily Watson stepped into film acting for the first time with her lead performance, but it would be more accurate to say that she sailed into acting history with what may be the best female performance in twenty years. She does not try to romanticize her role or break out into long, preachy monologues. Instead, Watson portrays her character, Bess, as if she were Emma Bovary paired with Joan of Arc. We know that God is not really commanding Bess to sleep with other men in order to cure her husband, and that this is probably a result of her mental instability. But we still sympathize with her anyway, because she is willing to do whatever she thinks is the right thing, no matter how much she is personally harmed. She is a symbol of all those who have made a futile self-sacrifice in order to defend what they believe.When I first saw \"Breaking the Waves,\" I misunderstood it like many viewers. I couldn't get past the faded visual texture, since I was used to big romantic films with lush photography. When I saw it a second time, about two years later, I understood why von Trier and his cinematographer, Robby Muller, used this technique- it keeps the story grounded in the day-to-day existence of the characters. Most of the spiritual meanings behind the story are deeply hidden, and are hard to catch on a first viewing. But the ending to the film- particularly the last shot, which I will be kind enough not to give away- arrives with the intensity of an explosion. After I saw it a second time and obtained a better understanding, the various elements of \"Breaking the Waves-\" the powerful acting, the sharp direction, the skillful technical aspects- brought me to tears.Many American viewers will find it challenging to pick up the meanings, seeing as they are used to soppy Julia Roberts romances that have comic interludes tossed in (is it any wonder that most of the disapproving comments were from the US?). But I would really encourage everyone to watch \"Breaking the Waves\" twice, even if you enjoyed it the first time. Von Trier has stripped away all the conventions of run-of-the-mill \"romance dramas\" and has given us something that is entirely unique and genuinely heartbreaking.",

            "content": "This was one of the hardest movies I've ever had to sit through, one of the most uncomfortable experiences I've ever had. To supporters of the film, my reaction would be proof of how brutally honest and uncompromising it was; to detractors, how sadistic, shallow and ridiculously plotted. I place myself firmly in the latter category, but am willing to say, on the basis of how many people like this film, that perhaps it all just comes down to personality. I guess there's people who can truly see the ideas of faith and selfless love embodied by the events of this story; more power to them, I guess - maybe you'll be one of them. I happen to believe that the movie makes a mockery of just those things - its scripting seems particularly inept for the points it wants to make. I mean, what are we really supposed to think of the husband: is he just out of his mind? Bitter at his fate and taking it out on Bess? Really hoping for sustenance from hearing of Bess's adventures? Since we don't know the motivation, the story just seems preposterous and cruel.I will admit that Emily Watson is phenomenal; she truly gets inside the head and projects herself into the personality of someone who is just slightly off-balance, and instead of making her an archetype of the retarded or na\u00efve person, creates an extremely detailed and specific character - not quite like any other I've ever seen. Several people at this site have compared her performance to Frances McDormand's in Fargo and it's a useful comparison: where McDormand comes up with an interesting and original character type and then just coasts on it all through the movie, Watson is totally alive in her part, changeable and unpredictable from moment to moment. And the scenes where she prays to God and does both parts are funny, yes - and in the hands of a lesser actress that's all they would be. But Watson endows them with such heart and conviction that they're also heartbreaking.But aside from her, I found the movie to be a mess, not least of which because it falls into that dreaded category of \"Who's the true crazy person?\" type of film. You know the kind, where characters (usually leads) who are genuinely unstable are set up to face the wrath of the cold and unfeeling and the decks are stacked so heavily that we're meant to champion the heart and goodness of the nuts simply because their opposition are such jerks (I think One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest created the mold for this, but it can be seen equally well in such disparate films as Forrest Gump, Natural Born Killers, Citizen Ruth, What About Bob? and Patch Adams). These kinds of films are always manipulative in the worst sort of way, for they force you into an unrealistic choice between compassion and common sense.But maybe you'll like this movie, I just don't know. As a basic rule of thumb, I'd say that if in the first half an hour to forty-five minutes you're not drawn into the story or to the world that's presented here, then you're not likely to buy into or be moved by the rest of it. It's definitely one of those like it or hate it films that isn't likely to get any better the more you watch or the more you think about it. To those who enjoy it, I'm glad for you - but I don't understand you.",

            "content": "Emily Watson is wonderful in this film, but it's brutally depressing, and a long 158 minutes to boot. She plays a character who is initially straight out of Dostoevsky, that of the incredibly pure-hearted, simple woman. Her faith in God is matched only by her love for her husband (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), and both are unshakable. She carries on conversations with God, voicing his words in response to her own. She goes into her marriage with innocence, discovering sex with wide-eyed enthusiasm. She is childlike in a lot of ways and seems off her rocker to some around her, and yet she also seems a little more enlightened - a little closer to the teachings of Christ in her purity - than the hypocritical churchmen in her small, conservative town. She's the one who points out that it isn't fair that only the men can talk during the church service. However, her love and her faith are put to the test when her husband suffers a horrible accident at work, rendering him paralyzed. In his dejected state he futilely attempts suicide, then asks her to have sex with other men and tell him about it, in order to give him a reason to keep living.Despite the earthy content, there is a strong element of religion running through this film, and by that I mean the love and purity of a kind-hearted soul, as opposed to Christian dogma. I wondered, who is sacrificing themselves here - the husband, who is possibly nudging her towards another man for reasons beyond voyeurism, since he wants her to have a \"normal\" life, or her, for going against her morality and inner nature to attempt to do as he asks? Unfortunately, the acts she commits are more seamy than sanctified, and there is an air of ickiness that pervades the second half of the film. The film does not explore the issues of love, faith, and sacrifice with any meaningful depth, which was dissatisfying and made it a slog to get through.There is a third character, a doctor, who seems like a virtuous man initially, remaining professional when she offers herself to him, and telling her that her grief over her brother from the past and her husband in the present is normal, not something to be institutionalized over or given drugs to for. He eventually does a dastardly thing with the husband, however. Between the husband, the churchmen, the doctor, and those who beat her up, the men in this film cruelly abuse the main character. I kind of felt like Lars von Trier did as well, cooking up this improbable story and having her go through with those things, which was sensationalistic if not misogynistic in its own right.The use of a handheld camera for most if not all of the footage, and a clipped style in editing had its advantages, but not all of the production style worked for me. The chapter introductions with still images and lengthy music cuts were excessive, literally a minute to a minute and a half at a time. The location shooting in Scotland was drab, which was probably part of the point, but certainly didn't hold any visual appeal. Overall though, it was the story that just wasn't for me, and I was glad when it was over.",

I think that when Dodo says to Jan that she's not right in the head, I think that she is referring to a breakdown that Bess suffered after the death of her brother.I'm not a religious person, but I don't think that the film is blasphemous like some religious people have said.  If you watch the ending it is far more about the grace of God and how He not only sees all, but understands a great deal more than we give him credit for.  I found the ending to take a very pro- religion stance even though the action leading up to it could be construed as anti-religion.I also think that the town depicted here is a rare one.  I don't think Von Trier was trying to depict a typical Scottish town.As for the reason why Jan asks Bess to go with other men, my opinion is that he believed he would be stuck in that bed for the rest of his life and he wanted Bess to experience sex, knowing how much she enjoyed it and how much it altered and obviously affected her the day of her wedding.  He thought that she would never do that, until Dodo says to him, \"You can get her to do whatever you want.\"  Then he knew that if he told Bess to do that, she would, because he remembered how much she adored him.  But, that said the reason I think that Von Trier doesn't tell us why Jan has made this request upon his wife is because she doesn't question it, and so neither should we.Also, the reason why Bess eventually goes where she does (in the sky) is because she is like a saint.  Her gift, or so she says, is that she believes and she believes until the end, and God understood that she believes.  He saw her praying and He saw he evil deeds, but Bess - unlike the old churchies who seem as if they talk to God like they know more than He does - believed and that is the most important thing.Now, I don't know how Emily Watson approached her character, but she seems to act on instinct like Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant rather than a mapped out plan, and for those who have said this film is one-dimensional specify why.  I didn't find it that way at all.  To me the viewer can see that things are working behind the eyes of the characters.  Also for people who have said that the film doesn't really show the daily lives of these characters, if it did the film would be pointless because that's not what it is about!",

            "review_title": "A religious cautionary tale set within a classic love story",
            "content": "This 'discussion' is intended more as an analysis of the main theme of the film 'Breaking the Waves' than a review, so if you haven't seen the film read elsewhere (spoilers) for a rundown of the basic plot.Like most things in life, we all have differing perceptions and opinions regarding the various events that transpire within life. Personally I find all view points interesting regardless if (I believe) those judgements are insightful, stupid or just far fetched. So I come he quite often to read the reviews on various films I've seen or contemplate seeing. I think there is one universal truth regarding cinema, most of it is rubbish with about as much depth as single page from the laughable script. The care for the integrity of the story goes as far as the limit of product endorsement and how may units on seats can be achieved for a particular target market. (yes I'm a somewhat jaded movie goer). This is my first posting here. Normally I wouldn't bother for two reasons. 1 - the film has so many postings that it requires more time to read them than see the actual film. 2 - the film doesn't deserve the time wasted in writing about it. I'm not about to pretend that my view deserves a look or that is deserves the time to even argue whatever conclusion I find myself committing to.Unfortunately what most people don't realise is that interpreting any medium (whether it a book, music, art or film) is a two way transaction. Meaning that the author/artist/director's doesn't necessarily have a fixed point. Lastly the gross sum of experience and environmental differences inevitably compels us to draw out our own lines based on that collection of events. Course that's not meant to say something is meaningless based on the many variables making the equation.Finally I come to the point of why I've bothered writing this at all. Keeping mind that every review on this page has merit, I thought something was missing in the interpretation that others only scratched the surface with (I only read the first 20 or so -the other 100 will have to wait so apologies if this is a rehash of what have others have already written). Despite perhaps what Lars intended with this story, I believe it has a precautionary religious message contained within a classic Shakespearian love story. It is played out in a remote British isle coastal town, a deliberate choice as a backdrop for its insular Christian community. It portrays a modern day window in the destructive power that faith can have on the human psyche amplified in the protagonist Bess (Emily Watson) because she only has a simple set of ideals. The church's weapon of control is in the form or guilt and how it's used to manipulate the community. Bess' beautifully simplistic view is torn by this belief system as she desperately tries to adhere to it (displayed by Bess' 'conversations' with god at the church late at night).They story revolves around the newly married couple, Bess and Jan (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd). We get an early peak at the power the church elders hold over the small town the story is set (displayed in the drinking competition between Jan's mate and Bess' grandfather - a church elder) and the grudging acceptance of the marriage of outsiders to town folk. Bess' sanity is stretched once she is faced with the realisation that Jan is going to be spending much time away on the offshore rig. Here is where the communities support structure begins to fail Bess. The women of the town are ill equipped to deal with the phenomenon of family being away because of the church's patriarchal belief make-up. With the exception of Dodo, all those around here are next to useless in assisting the na\u00efve Bess.In an attempt to deal with absence of her partner Jan, she turns to the elder's 'caricature ' of god. At this point, Bess' derangement becomes evident as she tries to reconcile her fear and longing in a mindset that can be best described as child-like. She asks that her husband be returned to her and in an ominous premonition of things to come, god replies 'is this what you really want?'. In a disastrous turn she gets her wish but now Jan is a cripple as result of a accident on the rig. Initially Bess is just happy that her husband is home but things slowly change when she realises his health is far from assured.When she is confronted by her husbands wish that she move on with her life and learn to love again, its twisted between her own devotion to Jan (the hook Jan hopes divert Bess' attention slowly turns to a perverted fantasy between the pair) and the practical aspect of healing emotional wounds via seeing other people (Dr Richardson). The downward spiral of Bess' mental state is compounded by the family's and the communities rigid social structure. Initially its just the elders that show a lack of understanding; -the surprisingly archaic male only burial ceremony and the discovery Jan makes when he learns that that same person has been consigned to hell by the elders. -the priest walking away from the wounded Bess leaving her to young tormentors who throw stones at her and call her 'tart'.As the story progresses, the family become almost instrumental in Bess' final destruction (her own mother who refuses to let her in the house while children are stoning her, her grandfather and the elders basically banish her from the community and later when her grandfather refuses to see her on her death bed). Her immediate family a product of the small town's church indoctrination.Throughout the film the voice of reason comes in the form of Bess' friend Dodo. Dodo tries valiantly to help Bess through her hardship and is alone (aside from Jan) in seeing Bess' uncomplicated good heart. In the end she is defeated by the corruption that came as a result of the incompatibility of church edict and Jan/Dodo unconditional love for her.Some find the ending, the church bells ringing in the sky just after Jan steals Bess' body and commits it to the sea somewhat contrived, ill fitting or that its somehow a win for Bess (Jan's stealing of the body is purely a pyric victory against the church leaders belief). However I think the effect was meant to illustrate the joke. A somewhat sadistic proclamation that the elders god is a very different beast compared to that which is worshiped in contemporary society. I say 'sadistic' because it would be entirely unfair for god to make the demands it did of the child-like soul like Bess. Force her to struggle with guilt as a result of the consequences through her 'chats' with god in the church (asking god to bring her husband home only to find her wish granted in to form of a crippled Jan). This occurrence can only be a product of a vindictive old testament god pushed onto an simple an ignorant coastal community.  In the end Bess's sacrifice is in vain to serve a cruel god with the intimate irony being Jan's recovery. The bells are symbolic victory for narrow-minded belief system. Bells aren't for mortals to chime but reserved for a medieval god to announce another triumph for intolerance and a reaffirmation of the elders decree.",

I bet if this was filmed in an american commercial style and starred Julia Roberts, with a soothing melodious soundtrack in it, everybody would love this movie. It\u00b4s not the story, people hate, it\u00b4s the way the movie is filmed, just because it isn\u00b4t comercial enough.But i can\u00b4t imagine this story being better filmed. This is NOT a depressing story. It might look like, and be very disturbing sometimes, but in the end all that is done in the movie by Emily Watson\u00b4s character, is done for love. Love in a form so pure and so emotional that all society rules and codes, stop having any meaning or value, if they are an obstacle to that love.This is not neurotic. It might seem like, when we look at this story through our society eyes, but in the end this is just a story about a pure love. Love as an emotion.Emily Watson does a fantastic and trully amazing job in this movie. She alone is the reason to watch BREAKING THE WAVES. She gives instant credibility to her character actions, creating a beautiful and fragile woman, much more strong than any other of the characters in the movie because she follows her path for what she thinks is right against every rule, while the others keep living their ordinary predictable depressing lives, without the courage to change, afraid of what the community might say.This is a very, very beautiful story with an incredible screenplay. And as someone has said in one review, this is the ideal movie to watch with someone we love.True it\u00b4s a sad movie, but very beautiful once we get to feel the emotion in the central character. And it even has an happy ending, altough in a more celestial way, proving the point of the story about where Love can take a person. Much more beyond a earth happiness. Many people didn\u00b4t enjoyed the esotheric ending, but i think it\u00b4s a very original one and a good complement to this story.This is a great movie, the story, the actors, the photography, everything is just perfect for this story, and the director does an incredible camera work in this movie. Sometimes it feels like we are inside it next to the characters. And the images separating the different chapters of the story are just trully beautifull. Pure paintings.And for all those who love the movie THE BIG BLUE (Le Grand Bleu), you get to see Jean Marc Barr, who played Mayol in that movie, this time in BREAKING THE WAVES playing a total oposite character. If you have associated this actor to the image he has in Big Blue, prepare to be shocked, (hehehehe). I\u00b4ll say no more.Beautiful, really beautiful movie. But not for every one.So if you are brainwashed by the visual style of american cinema, stay away from this because you\u00b4ll probably going to hate this movie.But if you love Cinema, i can garantee that you\u00b4ll love BREAKING THE WAVES.It\u00b4s impossible not to.Powerful, powerful movie.

Jan works offshore on the rigs, and whilst away, has a terrible accident that will change his and Bess' relationship forever. That is the very briefest outline of the movie - but suffice to say that outline does as much for describing this movie as taking a hoover to an earthquake. Whenever i review movies i usually just write them off the cuff, my thoughts and feelings about how it made me feel, and indeed afterwards, as with this particular one its sticking with me hard, and I'm still struggling how to describe it. Bess is a virgin when she and Jan meet - the community she lives in the church dominates all - and Bess, a lonely, slightly unstable childlike woman is thrown into a world with Jan unlike anything she has seen before - she cries profusely when he has to return to his rig, screams in agony and cannot bear to be apart from him at all, not for any length of time. The love that she feels for Jan - and he her - is the basis of the movie, but i hesitate to describe this as just a love story, sure its the basis for the actions of the characters, but there are so many themes here (that i will try and cover) that it will stick in your mind, as you replay it over and over. Jan returns to his rig, and Bess agonises without him... praying every day for his return, which she gets, as Jan is crippled in an accident that sends him back to Bess. As I've stated, some of the many themes explored in the movie, along with a quite astonishing performance by Emily Watson as Bess raise it way above the average. But by the end, i couldn't help but feel id just watched arguably one of the greatest films ever made, a feeling that is still lingering. So Jan is crippled, and unable to fend for himself at all. Jan is also unable to make love to his wife either, and persuades Bess to take another lover in order that she can tell him of her experiences, and he might still 'live', as lovemaking with his wife is what keeps him alive. So Bess, initially, is filled with horror at the thought of being with anybody else, but comes to realise that Jan will live if she can sexually satisfy him, and that becomes her aim. The extraordinary tale of love is intermingled with a very difficult notion of sexual redemption - the theme is one of obvious debate amongst many, but the wondrous side of it is there is no right and wrong - Bess's sister in law and her doctor, her mother, church and community ostracise her, label her a tart and cannot disguise their disgust at her actions. But one of the messages that Von Trier is allaying is how much can you love somebody before you go to that length? how many us know what we would do? these themes in particular roused great passions in me, because i don't have the answers. if i loved somebody that much would i do whatever it took to please them? Bess's final actions may not be redemptive, what she does is her ultimate act of love, and the scenes at the end truly are heart breaking. Shot in a unique, amateur camera style that is necessary for the element of realism, as with all of the greatest movies, you actually forget your on a sofa watching. your there, with them, feeling the emotions they feel, and putting yourself in their shoes. 'Breaking the waves', truly a movie experience like no other. David Ford",

However, if you already have read about it, then read on...With the exception of a documentary I saw many years ago, this is the only movie that's ever made me cry.Many others have already discussed this film.  I need not reprise the glowing praise;  I will, for the most part, pass over the (utterly stupid) criticism -- though I will say that the camerawork is a hallmark of cinema verit\u00e9, and is by no means anything but intentional.  It can be hard to handle at times, but the movie wouldn't be the same without it.  Emily Watson is beyond compare, and light-years beyond Frances McDormand in Fargo -- who _was_ brilliant, but this is on a whole different level.I'll simply add this:  if you're planning on getting married to someone, or being with them for a long time, watch this film together.  If they reply to this movie with a shrug, or worse, you would do best to run away from them, as fast and as far as you can.",

            "content": "If I had a dollar for every time 'devastating' was used to describe a Lars Von Trier film, I would have...well, a lot of money. He continually relishes on images that shock the mind and soul. He is admired for his ability to not hold back. His ties to Dogme 95 are evident, but paradoxically, here he makes it a deliberate stylistic endeavour; his favoured nervy, hand-held style, the washed out palette, the graininess of the image. How ironic that in the pursuit of authenticity and simplicity he had taken an extra, unnatural step - the filtered look of the film was achieved by transferring the stock to video and back again. The desired impression is the guise of naturalism and realism, as if we were observing the events ourselves. But this collapses on itself when we are the only ones in the scene with Emily Watson. Suddenly the fragility takes on a different meaning. We become perverse intruders on a mental breakdown, but there is no one here save for the audience, so it is performance we are witnessing. To her credit, Watson keeps us guessing whilst the script is more direct. It presents to us a child, without any tangible prospects or abilities, who throws tantrums when control is wrested away from her because of the real world's demands. She counts the days on the calendar until her beloved Jan returns, but this isn't enough - Von Trier feels the need to throw in a crude, stick figure drawing as though she is a kindergartner with a crush. The first time she responds to her own prayer in a deeper intonation (God is Irish, apparently), it is mildly humorous, but by the end it is tragic. Watson is good enough to seed doubt in our minds. When her faith begins to waver, these prayers lose their mystical quality and just once, she responds as God in her normal voice. She shows glimpses of Bess' logic and reason when she wrests with her own conscience and selfishness. In the very early beginnings, she acknowledges the camera and invites us into her mind, cheekily grinning and almost winking at what is to come. There are brief moments of heart and stability; see how Watson makes phone sex endearing and cute, how she pauses and hesitates to be explicit, because her religion has coded her against it. So to dive into the deep end, and go against these teachings must demonstrate incredible strength and willpower, must it not? A oft criticism of the film is that it treats Bess not only in childish terms, but as a surrogate for battering, being shoved along without agency and subject to continually harsher abuse. She is confined by the patriarchal constructs of the religion, raised a virgin and cursed to hell for her sins (but those sins which are an act of bravery and pure love). A gender reversal would not only be illogical and radical, but conjure none of the shock. Von Trier is vague about the origins of her development and capabilities, and hastily sidesteps this dilemma. He answers the true question with his final sequences, which are steeped in Christian allegory: the public denouncing by the church (the Pharisees), the Christlike sacrifice by taking the burden of sin, the desecration of the grave for and the spiritual rebirth (at sea), with the bells signalling the miracles that we have witnessed. It's religious propaganda, and not subtle at that; Bess must be put through figurative hell (the result of her own sin) before she finally gains her martyrdom. And it is typical Von Trier, a cruel joke played by a cruel god. She dies with the knowledge that she has failed her husband, and is going to literal hell. Only then can Jan begin to walk again.",

Such ambivalence may arise from the close-up hand-held camera-work, which manages to expose the highest emotions, in both the honest, intimate scenes and the dramatic, jaw-dropping closing minutes. So too does the ensemble acting, particularly from Oscar nominated Emily Watson, which manages to give the movie a formidable emotional punch without sinking into incredulity. It is also a pretty long feature, clocking in at an impressive 2 1/2 hours, although the film isn't a second too long.This is compelling stuff, dealing with both love and faith at their extremities, but without resorting to sentimentality. Von Trier's views on faith are all too apparent here - a belief in God, but not in how he is worshipped - and the parallels with 'Ordet' are clear. An amazing film that really has to be seen to be appreciated. a must see for all audiences.",

            "content": "Let me start out by saying that you can disagree with someones opinion, but that doesn't stop you from admiring the passion and beauty that they put in to their argument. This is the first Lars Von Trier film I've seen and, after seeing how well put together this one is, I hope too see many more to come.The film's main themes all about God, fate and the power of true love to conquer all, however I think there are more interesting subtleties to it than just this. I think it is also about the role of women in religion, with the main character, Bess, being portrayed almost as the female version of Jesus. There are too many similarities for it to be purely coincidental, however I do not particularly want to go into details in fear of ruining an amazing story for anyone who does decide to watch the film.The film takes a very minimalistic yet realistic style, with an almost documentary feel to it at times. The picture quality a lot of scenes is not great but I think it is done intentionally to help emphasise the feelings of dreariness and hopelessness that are a major part of the film. Something that makes me more sure of this are the stunning still shots of the chapter titles, with some of them actually being extremely bright to give the viewer a sense of hope and calm when it is needed. The title shots themselves are extremely symbolic and are not just put in for the sake of being wondrous natural imagery. One shot towards the end of the film stuck with me in particular, a shot where you see a glorious sunrise with a lush pink sky fading away to a ghostly blue. This to me was symbolic of death, with the blood fading away just to leave a cold reminder of what was once so alive and wondrous.All the cast put in quality performances, managing to come across as extremely genuine in roles that were very hard to do without going over the top and becoming too melodramatic. Emily Watson in particular, who played the character Bess, was sensational. In her first proper film role she managed to transition from moments of innocence, madness and passion seamlessly and without a performance as good as the one she gave, it would have completely ruined the film. The dude who plays the crippled husband was also pretty nifty as well.The film is fairly long, clocking in at over 2 and a half hours, but it really didn't feel that long at all. It is important that if you want to watch it that you really set yourself some time aside to do so as the film does require your concentration and undivided attention. If you can find the time to watch it then you will be vastly rewarded. It is a a sad beautiful film that is extremely emotionally draining. You better watch it.",

It's a film that beholds greatness within its enduring story, and so its 150+ minutes length offers page-turnings of brilliance; off course it's the unforgettable performance by Emily Watson and the rest of the actors (and especially Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katrin Cartlidge as Bess' sister-in law), the documentary-like approach by Von Trier, the granular cinematography by Robby M\u00fcller, and the surprisingly uplifting choice of music (T.

Even her doctor ultimately conspired to be rid of Jan and to separate them. She was victimized and ultimately murdered by the men on the boats.I find it confusing that Trier so clearly portrays patriarchy in the film and yet celebrates her martyrdom which was more accurately her destruction.

The great thing about BREAKING THE WAVES, that few people seem to realize, is that not only is it a completely original love story but it is also a compelling spiritual film. It takes two concepts and combines them to form one of the greatest films ever made. Very few films today even have trouble developing just the love aspect of a film. In the hands of any other director and the finished product would have been either to preachy or too corny. Von Trier uses a hand-held camera to convey the environment of the lead character's world. As a result, we become entangled in these people's lives. In my review of this film I have decided to reveal as little of the plot as possible only because I think that anyone who decides to see it should know as little about the plot as possible.

Yes many of you have already witnessed how special this piece of cinema is. I'm not one for producers and other knowledges about the making of a film and feel a little ashamed about this lack of whatever it is that I should grasp. However I can relate to what this film did for me. As some described it, it was and has been again a very unique experience. I had my struggling with many topics addressed here and could really \"feel\" for what is portrayed in this film. I still retain much of that simple naivety that want this world to be good and so vouch much for \"Beth\". Although I have work enough years in mental health, I never felt the need for Beth to be locked up - (yes perhaps I'm the one with this need!) But all along riding my emotion with her calvary I felt I understood and agree with her choices even if they would not have been mine. So often one, feel guilty about not following one's instinct. I do forget that she is the product of those extraordinary puppeteers, but it was good enough for me to dwell on her character. I've read quite a few commentaries and was surprised not to hear any about how Beth felt responsible for Jan's accident, as she virtually asked for it. Indeed, how Emilly Watson managed such acting, as if she had been transfixed by some supernatural forces. Even with previous experience she would have been as remarkable as she was, but perhaps this lack of acting experience produced this genuine transformation. Yes I also liked the hand held camera (perhaps it gives me hope with my own filming!) Some have reported annoyance at the Chapters and their length, I enjoy them very much, they too broke some waves and give you a little break and time to reflect on and perhaps digest the previous chapter. It was interesting for me that SBS did screen the week after a French film \"Betty Blue\", and if one can draw comparisons I believe these two emotional epics would be appropriate subjects.

Even so, it has every ounce of artistic creation that will lead the audience down (or shall we say 'up') a road of clarevoyant understanding and appreciation for the main characters' dilemma. While the dogma style may have many detractors complaining about shaky camera work, I find BTW to be a seamless integration of cinema verite within a steeply ever climbing dramatic plot. Far beyond being 'shaky', the camera movement constantly underlies and supports the building or resting energy of every scene. The genius of the best scenes is witnessed in the uncut panning between two characters dialogue. The standard Hollywood tool of 'over the shoulder shot' cut to juxtaposed 180 degree shot is completely thrown out the window with Von Triers seamless panning following of the action. It is as if the viewer himself is standing in the actual room watching the drama unfold uninterrupted by the caprices of an editor. The camera is still when the action is still. And the camera is active when the action is active. And the camera is always following exactly where the curious eye wants to look.Color and texture, while on the surface may read as 1970's, are instead always following and supporting the dramatic action. The colors are natural brown and green- due in no small part to location and natural lighting. But beyond the surface, they reinforce the qualities of natural and earthly love that is at the heart of the plot. Brightness and shadow play together in the most intimate ways to underscore the intesity of the very love torn plot unfolding before us.If you are looking for a modern study in the techniques of camera verite- I think you have found it. Look for the contrasts in wide angle solitude vs. intimate closeup emotion. Bright public space vs. private inner sanctum. The darkness of dread vs. the happiness of light. The visual roller-coaster which Lars Von Trier weaves is filled with metaphor which will keep the viewer transifxed viewing after viewing.",

If you find intelligent criticism there then the film is best avoided, if the critics are inarticulate thickos then you may well have a gem.As an exploration of the Scotch psyche, I'd say that this is brilliant. It obviously, for dramatic reasons, exaggerates, but the essence is there. The evil that the calvanistic god-bothering of the Wee Frees can lead to is nicely shown. On the other hand, if you're stuck in the North of Scotland you're highly unlikely to turn into a fun-loving optimist - it just isn't that sort of place.I have loved most Dogma films and, though this isn't one - for one thing the music isn't played in real time as part of the action and there are some quite surrealistic effects - it has all the main elements there. Just as Dogville reveals a similar small-town nastiness (though that is a power critique of the nihilism that is Yankland), this, as I've said, explores the scotch character brilliantly.Bess is magnificently portrayed. If you haven't met barmy people then you may think much is exaggerated. I think she is a brilliant, and properly sad, exploration of madness. There are pre-echos of 'Dancer in the Dark', the similarities are revealing. Though insanity presents in many different ways, the heart of the darkness is always the same.",

I've never really run into a movie that has made such an impact or changed my outlook on life as much as this one.It's an extraordinary story with superb acting (especially that of Emily Watson and the late, great Katrin Cartilidge), beautiful landscaping and scenery, great music separating each \"chapter\" and I think that it's given more intimacy and power with Lars Von Trier's documentary-like approach to filming it.That said, it is not a film I would recommend to anyone.  One has to approach watching this movie with an open mind and with some patience because it is slow moving at times.While Frances McDormand did a decent job in Fargo, I do believe that Emily Watson should have won the Academy Award in 1997.  I think it's rare that we'll see a performance like hers again in quite some time.  But hopefully, she'll win one in due time. :)9/10",

            "content": "At first glance, \"Breaking the Waves\" may appear to be slow paced and full of unnecessary exposition. However, as the film unfolds, each scene comes together like pictures in a photo book. Protagonist Bess McNeil is an innocent and naive woman, who falls madly in love with a man named Jan Nyman. After the two are married, Jan is sent off to work at an oil rig, leaving Bess all alone. Bess pines for her husband and prays for his safe return to the point where her family and friends call her selfish for not readily accepting circumstances. Tragedy strikes when Jan is badly injured in an accident and is feared to never recover. In order to keep his beloved wife happy (and in a drug induced delusional state), Jan encourages Bess to sleep with other men in order to feel the love and affection that he can not show her. Torn between her devotion to her husband and the strict religious convictions she had been raised with, Bess struggles to fulfill Jan's wishes and maintain her role as a devoted child of God. Ultimately Bess chooses to serve her husband, believing that God would want her to make him happy. Bess feels no love from her encounters with other men, longing only for the touch of her husband. The task kills her inside, but she lies to Jan, saying that she enjoyed the experiences. She soon finds herself shunned from her community as her attempts to serve her husband, her community and God fall apart and ultimately lead to her exile and death at the hands of a violent gang who sexual assault and murder her. As she prays for guidance, it becomes clear that there are no answers and the choice between being a good wife and a good Christian can not be compromised. We're given a small solace at the end of the film, when Jan (recovered from his injury) learns of his wife's death and the loyalty she showed him pays tribute to Bess after the church refuses to show such respect. \"Breaking the Waves\" is a tragedy of conscience, in which no matter what choice is made, heart break is the inevitable outcome. It show cases the conflict between following the strict and unwavering doctrines of religion and doing what is right in unusual and unforeseeable circumstances.",

She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with.It made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a Disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life.I loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that \"Dancer in the Dark\" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialog between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in \"The Lord of the Rings\", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow.I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like \"Take Shelter\", \"Dancer in the Dark\", \"Leaving Las Vegas\", \"Closer\", or \"The Marriage of Maria Braun\".",

The whole premise is not so unique, as is the acting and filming techniques.There is a crucifying silence to the film, which is in part due to the tragic circumstances that take place. The absence of voice definitely plays a role in the entrancement. The characters facial expressions, and emoticons keep you on the edge of your seat. However, Emily Watson's tragic screaming scenes and talks to God are enthralling, and definitely noteworthy. And her coy smile is so like the Mona Lisa's.Great performances.

This film has everything, action, drama, sex, violence, love and loss, and asks some extremely serious existentialist philosophical questions in an extraordinary way.

This is absolutely cutting edge cinema, I'd never seen anything like it before (I saw 'Dancer in the Dark' after I saw this one).

That's why my vote is 4 instead of 1.It's a pretty film and a provocative one, yet it is without much value in the real world.

She is NOT a sinner, as her God is not their God. Her God is an inner force which drives her to live a naive and tormented life. You can guess she wasn't that happy before she married Jan, and he becomes some sort of enlightment in her life, as if God himself came down from heaven to marry her. Anyway, i think Jan was selfish, and actually not that believable, i mean, i understand him asking such a task to his wife, but you never really feel his desire or impulse to do so. I specially love the scene when they are watching Lassie, that's one where you can see her innocence. Watson is a superb actress.",

The hand held camera gives it very much a documentary feel, and as such doesn't have that sort of glossed over hollywood shmaltz look to it.I was in fact puzzled by the 'miraculous recovery', but It's so essential to the ending of the movie that to do without it virtual defeats the ending's purpose.Von Trier certainly falls in the quality of film makers such as Hertzog, who when honouring Murnau's Nosferatu, for example shot deliberately long travel scenes, he could have curtailed them, but he chose purposely to engage the viewer into the film itself.  This type of film making, is less like watching jump cut garbage like Requiem For A Dream, (how can you destroy a Hubert Selby Jr. book...

Breaking the Waves contains neither, and it is a film worth watching.  Some movies that go out of their way to avoid conventional filming techniques sacrifice story clarity and basic viewability, but Breaking the Waves sacrifices neither.  Usually, handheld camerawork in a film annoys me greatly, but it was somehow used very effectively in this one.  Emily Watson is a brilliant actress in this film, to the point that I (an actor) forgot she was an actress.  I wouldn't say this is the best performance by an actress ever, simply because crazy people are easier to play than sane ones, usually.  The actor who played Jan is surprisingly good; I say surprisingly, because his part is the type which could easily be screwed up, and he didn't screw it up.  The rest of the cast is great, because they're believable, and I really appreciate the fact that the director didn't go out of his way to make Americans look completely heartless and/or stupid, as many non-Americans suppose we are.  About the story itself--there are two perspectives you can take on it.  You can see it as sacreligious, or you can see it as spiritual.  I choose to see it as spiritual, and feel that the director is criticising the Pharisaical attitude of the church elders instead of Christianity itself.  If anything is wrong with this picture, it's the director's tendency to resort to shock value to stir up his audience.  The story itself should be able to do that on its own.  But this is still a fine film, and see if you don't feel just as surprised as Bess late in the movie, when God doesn't talk to her for the first time.",

            "content": "There is a moment early on in Breaking the Waves where the lank-haired, doe-eyed Bess frolics out to the oceanside during a particularly joyous period in her life and, without premeditating it, turns to us, the audience, and offers a sharp blink and a smile. More than any other self-reflexive moment I can remember, Bess's greeting, a sweet salutation really, cuts right through me. Directed by the Dane Lars Von Trier (The Kingdom 1 and 2) and photographed by Robby Muller (Beyond the Clouds, Dead Man), the film's outward appearance is pretentious Euro-trash--seasickly handheld camera movement, long dramatic pauses, direct addresses to God, and panoramic shots of surrealistic landmasses in between acts, backed up by Elton John pop tunes.These precise elements, though, are what make the experience so unforgettable. It is a cruel classic, one that requires a dedicated, corn-fed viewer to properly absorb all of its emotion. Telling the ostensible story of a simple woman who is shattered by the paralysis of her husband, it's much more literate than it might seem. Love, it illustrates, is a very mighty power.The performances of Stellan Skarsgard, as Jan, Bess's starry-eyed husband, and Katrin Cartlidge, as her down to earth sister-in-law, permeate every quiet moment with unspeakable compassion.But in the lead role, Emily Watson delivers what is doubtlessly one of the three or four greatest screen performances of all time, a haunting, meditative, lurid, and astoundingly courageous job in which is she conveys supposedly misbehaved emotions that other actors would need a lifetime to draw out, if ever at all. A first-time actress, almost every scene of the film could have easily been screwed up by her, particularly a number of moments which require Bess to talk to directly to God, playing both parts. (Her literal interpretation of religion must be rationalized properly if we are to understand this film--especially its highly contested final shot, which I won't even get started on.) Watson, who hasn't been half as good in anything since, makes every exquisite second of the film, indeed every little smile, though-provoking and multi-meaningful. More than any other film of the 1990s, and despite (or maybe because of) some truly disturbing subject matter, Breaking the Waves is the kind of movie to watch with someone you love.",

            "content": "\"Breaking the Waves\" was a movie released in 1996 and starred Emily Watson as Bess McNeill and Stellan Skarsgard as Jan Nyman. Bess was portrayed as a naive young girl who had a great faith in God and always wanted to be good. She met Jan, a worldly man who worked on an oil rig and fell in love with him. Bess approached the elders of her very conservative church about wanting to marry Jan and she met with some resistance. Jan was considered an outsider to those of Bess' community and therefore considered trouble. The elders did however relinquish and allowed the marriage. Because of Bess' great faith, she had remained a virgin for her husband much to Jan's amazement. I believe that the director, Lars Von Trier, wanted to portray Bess as a \"good girl\" with strong moral values, in other words innocent. She gave herself to her husband fully and ached when he had to leave and go back to the rig. Because of her longing for her husband, Trier had the character pray unceasingly for his quick and ultimate return. This again was to show the strong faith that she had. In a twist of fate, Jan was injured to the point of being paralyzed for which Bess blamed her prayers regarding Jan's return and injury. I believe that Trier used this to exhibit the old adage \"be careful what you pray for\". Because Jan was unable to interact with his wife sexually, he urged Bess to take other lover's which of Bess did not want to do. As his health began to fail, she did finally relent and begin to sleep with others and recount the story of her escapades back to Jan, which he desired. We are led to believe that her actions were done to save her husband and that she, in the end, sacrificed herself to save him. I feel that this is reflective of the life of Christ as depicted in the Passion. Christ sacrificed himself to save the lost of the world. Christ did ache as he became human and was separated from God, but the Son , the Father and the Holy Spirit are one just as a husband and wife are and so the conflict becomes internal. The carnal aspects of this film tend to be exaggerated somewhat. I am just speculating, but it almost feels as if Trier uses his directing of films such as these to satisfy his own sexual fantasies. This is similar to what I feel about Quentin Tarantino and his film Pulp Fiction. This to me is exhibited in the scene where Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is brutally raped by Zed (Peter Greene) in front of Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). that was a very disturbing scene as was the thought of Bess giving herself to others when she did not necessarily want to. The brutality shown Bess at the hands of the sailors was equally disturbing. The use of the hand-held camera did make things interesting as it moved with the action and created a subjective view of things. The close-ups of Bess and having her looking directly into the camera helped to reinforce that subjectivity. The coloring or lighting was dark and kept things looking overcast and dim. I had read somewhere that the film was shot, recorded onto a VHS tape and then reprinted to give it that different look. I am not sure if it helped convey the images that the director was seeking or not but it did not overshadow the film. I am sure that Trier may have felt that he conveyed his theme and point brilliantly, but he knew what he was trying to convey. To an average person seeing the film just once, the theme was probably lost in the mix of the sex, the hysterical antics portrayed by Bess and the stoic, judgmental and unbending depiction of those in her church. However, sex sells and messages of faith and love fall short by comparison.",

All the neighbors say so and they should know, having spend all their lives in the same moralistic Scottish church and community.Husband is an outsider who is injured in an oil rig accident (rescuing someone, this being a movie). Husband lies in and out of comas, narrowly escaping death.Watson's character, Bess, does everything in her power to help him. But how much is in her power? The doctor thinks the husband has some kinks in his psychological makeup, and maybe the wife does as well. If husband asks that wife dress like a schoolmarm she does. When he asks her to wear revealing clothes or have sex with other men she complies until her well being and reputation are shot.Unfortunately her husband's health improves proportionately to how deeply and dangerously she debases herself.The dire prediction of the church Elders, \"Nothing good has ever come of marrying an outsider\" comes around 360 degrees from an earthly viewpoint, and 180 degrees in terms of what Bess attains spiritually.Another one of Lars Von Trier's na\u00efve, saintly heroines goes too far.Nicole Kidman in Dogville had to learn that her tormentors deserve their lessons, their life and their hardships. She paid the price to protect total creeps and they become even worse because of it.Von Trier calls karma like it is, except, can you really improve someone else's medical condition by debasing yourself? Maybe Emily Watson's martyr character needs to learn to not sacrifice herself for anyone else. Maybe she should let her husband have his karma, and let herself have her own karma of living without a husband she adored instead of taking on his karma.Von Trier has a fascination with martyr-ly women in their contemporary manifestations. His fascination creates a seemingly misguided (since lots of people think that a woman who sacrifices all for her family should be canonized, not punished) movie.Another contention with the spiritual message of the movie is why God would want someone to prove her devotion to Him by engaging in animal-nature behavior. There is a long religious history in which Saint Anthony, nuns, priests and monks have had to struggle to transcend sexual inclinations. Maybe Bess transcends by engaging physically without being engaged mentally. And she does take care of her husband's sexual needs.The bells tolling at the end suggests that God approves of Bess. She did everything in her power. She stayed in intense, personal communication with what she knows to be God. Maybe the price she paid was simply earthly. Maybe God gave a sign to show people that they should back off their criticism of her. Maybe Von Trier wanted to placate the viewers: Yeah, yeah, she's a saint. You got what you wanted after all.Maybe she is a saint.",

There is nothing loving or beautiful about how Jan forces his wife (who is clearly not quite \"all there\") to succumb to his perverse fantasies to gain some power back after he's paralyzed. Classic domestic violence if I ever saw it. Just because he's not hitting her doesn't mean he's not abusing her in the worst possible way.It's also pretty sickening to watch just how ugly religion can get and how fundamentalist christians (most religions, not just christians) could treat an innocent like Bess. A person who is good all the way but also who is probably with an IQ in the lower ranges. Organized religion really IS the root of all evil in this world because humans are the way they are.A male dominated, fundamentalist religious world where violence (sexual and emotional) is the main focus is portrayed very well in this raw movie. Stellan is awesome as always.Very good movie and definitely recommended. I just don't get why all the reviews are about this being a love story, but that's just me.",

            "content": "Although Lars Von Trier is always connected with DOGMA 95 in many people\u00a1\u00afs view, I dare to say that his cinematic creativity has nothing to do with those meaningless restraints. That means, getting rid of all the technical dogma propositions will do no harm to the artistic value of this film (and also dancer in the dark) which is carefully planned script and instinctively chosen motive: the heart of gold. PIETY: Bess, the heroine of this part of the trilogy, has no special disposition but a nearly innocent piety. She believes the existence of god not by studying Christian classic or, like many intellectuals in our time, being converted at last after a long futile search of truth in this very material world. Those who try to prove the existence of god, those who try to speculate on the existence of god, are not believers but she, she talks to god all the time like talking to an alter-ego. A superior-ego maybe, severe to her to the extent of cruelty maybe, still, he understand the love and pains in her life. After everybody has abandoned her, he is still there, in the last scene on the boat.She always reminds me of another woman, a modern saint, Simone Weil. The picture kept appearing before my eyes with Weil\u00a1\u00afs famous face, devastated by excess labor.LOVE: We might notice that there are certain differences between the love inside Bess, which is a religious one generated from her love toward god, and the love we experience ourselves everyday, a mundane, temporal one based on fragile contract. Thus we cannot make a sacrifice like that because we always follow dodo\u00a1\u00afs advice about \u00a1\u00aea woman has to care about herself\u00a1\u00af.\nOPPRESSOR: Women are expelled from those religious activities which should be more appropriately called political activities, a dirty and abstract game. But the inner power of Bess makes her to question \u00a1\u00aehow can men love a word?\u00a1\u00af It is as if Jesus himself will try to pose a question with a simplicity, vividness and directness like this. Of course nobody is listening because for them there is no truth in the talking itself but just who is talking.DEATH: Like all the saints in our history, Bess doesn\u00a1\u00aft have to die but she chooses to die in her own way. When she was waked up by dodo after fainted outside the church, her voice became so quiet and determined, without hate anymore, without confusion of destiny anymore, only a fearless frankness, as if she has acquired a new hidden power source from the earth: you have to go to the end of road when time comes without cowardly lingering on by many excuses, and thus you can say onto yourself on the cross with great relief:\u00a1\u00aeIt is accomplished!\u00a1\u00af",

            "content": "I had heard about Breaking the Waves on Siskel&Ebert when it came out in '96.  I wasn't into independent films at the time, but boy have I missed out on some great stuff.  Mainly, Breaking the Waves.  This film is one of the most brilliant and hauntingly beautiful films I have ever seen.  This is what real Cinema should be, not that Hollywood crap.  The way the movie forces you to give your all and suffer as much as the main character (Bess) suffers, is absolutely amazing.Breaking the Waves is a story about unconditional love.  The love of one being for another and the ultimate sacrifice for the beloved.  This haunting story echos the story of Christ's suffering to save humanity.  THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE!  This is the perfect story about love, devotion, and selfless sacrifice.Emily Watson gave one of the most beautiful and painful performances in the history of films.  She doesn't just ACT out Bess McNeil's character but she lives it too.  She becomes Bess and she suffers like Bess, and finally in the end, she receives redemption as Bess.  I could think of no one else as Bess but Watson.  The scenes in which she talks to God and plays both roles is pure heartbreak.  Yes, Frances was great in Fargo, but nothing compare to this.  The rightful recipient of the Best Actress Oscar is definitely Emily Watson.The recipient of Bess' unconditional love, her husband Jan, is played wonderfully by Stellan Staarsgard.  The wonderful supporting cast was vital to the effect of the story and deserves just as much acclaim.Lars von Trier shows that he is the master of real Cinema.  The panoramic shots between each act was brilliant and absolutely breathtaking.  The hand held camera shots were very necessary to give the audience a personal connection to the story.  It gives the sense of almost being there.This is a film containing a very disturbing yet beautiful story.  At times, you are ashamed by it and you feel responsibility for Bess' actions. This is not a movie for everyone.  You have to be willing to give yourself up and be willing to become violated because at times, you feel as though you are.  Watch this film with someone you love and see how they react to the message.  If anyone ever ask you what is true love and devotion and true sacrifice, recommend them this film.Bottom line is: you either love it or hate it, there are no in between. Perhaps this film might offend some people or perhaps this may become a revelation to some.  However, this is not a film to be missed or taken lightly.  If you are like me, this will be one of the best films you will ever see in your life.  But definitely, this film will provoke discussion.10/10",

What excites me about this film (aside from Emily Watson, who gives one of the 4 or 5 best performances I have seen by anyone ever)is that it is a disturbing and emotional film built on an underlying foundation of profound faith.  So many films mock or snub those who truly believe in God, but this film takes it very seriously.  The format of the film-- it looks almost like a documentary-- belies the actual structure, which is that of a fantasy or a fable.  The first time, I was bothered by the chapter headings, but after seeing the entire piece and knowing where it is heading, I noticed much I had never seen.  Bess actually looks at the camera in the beginning of the film, as if to tell us that this is a fable, but the construction of the film is such that we feel the brooding realism and get caught up in the tragedy.The first time I saw this, I was not sure how I felt about the last shot, but seeing it again, I see how necessary and magical that shot is, for this is a fairy tale told in a most unusual way.",

I was turned off by the chapter headings, felt a strong desire to wash and comb Jan's desperate hair, and wondered how these two unlikely characters got together in the first place. As the movie progressed I recognized it for what it really is - a masterpiece. When Bess asked to be taken back to the big boat, I knew serious trouble was inevitable. My only quibble with the story was the surreal ending. I enjoy a happy ending as much as the next person, but the bells were sentimental and over-the-top in what was otherwise a superb and sharply realistic movie.",

            "content": "Lars von Trier presents us with a masterwork in which he holds your attention from the opening title 'til the last. Set in the desolate north of Scotland, the film traces the plight of the endearing Bess and her husband, Jan, after he becomes paralysed in an accident on an oil rig. The film uses as its central theme love as transcendent over all, yet von Trier handles it with raw bravado.Bess, a saint-like figure, is so devoted to Jan that she is willing to do anything for him. Jan doesn't want her to stop enjoying life so he suggests ways for her to be happy so that he can be happy. Her desperate actions render her ostracized from her family and the pious community in which she lives. Even her sister starts to doubt Bess's intentions as she witnesses what she does to herself. Outcast from society and with Jan's condition ever-deteriorating, Bess turns to God - the only figure in her life who she still believes in. When that seemingly fails, she resorts to the unspeakable - the ultimate sacrifice - in order to save Jan. Bells ringing from the heavens above symbolise the ability of love to triumph over all and makes for one of the most heart-wrenching endings in the history of cinema.I have never seen a film which is so raw and confronting towards the spectator. Each sequence is framed by a title image with a chapter name denoting the theme or emotion underlying what is to follow overlade with the pop tunes approximating the film's tone. The camera is almost constantly hand-held making for a frenzy of images which draw you into the action. The montage is razor sharp: we shift from extreme melodrama to sober realism but not one image or scene is wasted in the total make-up.Trier frames a portrait of an angel named Bess who is willing to do anything for her beloved Jan. She is a victim of circumstances: she so wants to please Jan and make him happy, but by doing this she must go against her family and the strict rules of the town church of which she once was a part. There are marginal characters, however, who slowly begin to realise that Bess is the 'good one' in the grand scheme of things. These characters a her sister, the nurse, and Jan's doctor: at first they see her acts as preposterous and absurd, but soon they come to realise that they are the result of Bess's indominatable spirit and never-ending faith. Unfortunately for all, they realise this after it is all too late.Jan (and Bess) have the last laugh though - they have their final farewell on the oil rig where it all started where now no one can conqueor their undying love for each other.With \"Breaking the Waves\", Lars von Trier has produced a film which will leave you stunned through the sheer power it conveys in its characters, their relationships and the emotions which bind them together.",

Yes, I think, if only because it will be for a while the first you read. This film is magnificent - and entirely believable; I came out stunned. Principal reasons - the way that Bess's conviction that she can affect the course of events through her love and her direct line to God is neither confirmed nor denied - the story simply moves in ways which her prayers may or may not structure (personally, I think the last shot is a mistake, but different people have different reactions); the ambiguity of the secondary characters - especially Dodo and the doctor - perfectly consistent with themselves yet alternately vital supports and desperately damaging, with motivations which are obviously complex but which are never obvious. The elder breaking his glass - a scene to make you gasp. The way that very intense feelings are taken, not only seriously, but for granted. The portrait of the Calvinist community, which makes it clear that, terrifying and unforgiving as this religion is, it is somehow appropriate to a terrifying and unforgiving life where everyone *has* to know how to suffer. That'll do for starters. The \"chapter headings\" are accompanied by assorted seventies songs. One of them is by Leonard Cohen. That's a good touchstone - if LC stands you still, go to see this film.

Indeed, immediately after the film had ended I declared that it was 'good, but nothing special'. However, after five minutes of contemplation (I was so stunned by the ending, I needed to remind myself of the rest of the film) I retracted that last statement and declared the film a masterpiece, which it most definitely is. No film has had such an emotional effect on me from start to finish. The messages within the film may be convoluted at times, but the central performances from Emily Watson and Katrin Cartlidge, the emotional soundtrack, the beautiful scenery and landscape shot and the fantastic directing are enough to consider this film a work of genius. The surreal ending, I personally loved. It was such a powerful image, incredibly anti-repression and organised religion and pro-genuine feeling and hope. It was a harrowing film, and often I was shocked, but i consider this a benefit to a film, not something to complain about. Shocking me (I once thought) is quite difficult, however seeing a character who you so desperately sympathise with demeaning and ultimately killing herself out of a tragic and obsessive love for someone, who is clearly not behaving normally, nearly brought me to tears.I can not think of any problems with this beautiful film, which is by no means one of my favourites but is such an stunning work I feel obliged to lavish it with praise.",

I doubt the film could move or stir emotions the way it does without Ms. Watson's brilliant portrayal of the simple, yet very complicated, Bess.  I was awed by the cinematography; all of the camera angles and the colors of gray and shale brown, of that cold, harsh island, and those severe, repressed people and the story; all contrasts and twisted meanings.  On first view, as it neared conclusion,  I had it all stored in my brain as a brutally sad, psychological drama. Until of course, the very end, when the bells rang, and I realized that psychology didn't quite cover it, that Bess wasn't really simple or half-wit at all. I realized that this story is so much deeper than I first imagined. And I realize that this film is somewhat impossible to describe in words. It has once again left me numb, and my friend as well.
